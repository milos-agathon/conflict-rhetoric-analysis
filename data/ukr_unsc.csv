S/PV.8986,04/03/2022,Briefing and discussion of the attacks on nuclear facilities in Ukraine,"I listened attentively to the briefings by Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo and Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mr. Grossi. China is closely following the recent developments in Ukraine and expresses its concern about the relevant report about the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. According to the information the IAEA received from the Ukrainian nuclear authority, the main equipment of the nuclear power plant remain intact and the level of radiation unchanged. We also note the information and clarification provided by Russia on relevant matters. China attaches great importance to nuclear safety and security and hopes the relevant parties concerned will act with great caution and, with specialized technical assistance from the IAEA Technical Secretariat, work to jointly ensure the safety of relevant nuclear facilities inside Ukraine. The Ukrainian crisis is still undergoing complex changes. The most important thing right now is to ease tension, avoid more civilian casualties, intensify diplomatic efforts and return as soon as possible to the track of political settlement. Russia and Ukraine have held two rounds of direct dialogue and negotiations and have reached a preliminary consensus on setting up a humanitarian corridor. China welcomes this and hopes that it can facilitate better protection of civilians and the safe evacuation of all foreign nationals, including Chinese nationals. We encourage Russia and Ukraine to remain committed to stick to the overall direction of a political settlement and reach a negotiated solution that accommodates the legitimate concerns of the two parties and contributes to Europe’s lasting peace and security. China welcomes all diplomatic efforts conducive to political settlement and has played and will continue to play a constructive role to this end. The international community should stay cool- headed and rational and adopt a responsible, impartial and objective approach to creating a sound atmosphere and conditions for direct talks between the parties concerned. Any action must contribute to de-escalation and a diplomatic settlement, rather than add fuel to the fire of further escalation and the deterioration of the situation. ","I thank Mr. Grossi and Ms. DiCarlo for their briefings. France is seriously concerned about the threats to the safety, security and nuclear safeguards caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That is why France and its partners called on the Security Council to meet urgently. On 24 February, Russian forces entered the Chernobyl zone. The operating team at the power plant were held against their will as Russian soldiers took control of the plant. On 27 February, a loud detonation was heard near a radioactive waste disposal site in Kyiv. This morning, a fire was reported at the largest nuclear facility in Europe, following the Russian attack. As the Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs said, France strongly condemns the attack on a nuclear facility, whose security must be guaranteed. The consequences of a nuclear accident resulting from Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine are potentially devastating for human health and the environment. In 2009, Russia, along with the rest of the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), adopted a decision according to which any armed attack on or threat against nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes constitutes a violation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, international law and the Agency’s Statute. The competence of the Security Council under such circumstances is also established in the resolutions of the IAEA General Conference. Russia must immediately cease its dangerous illegal activities in order to restore the control of Ukrainian authorities over all nuclear facilities and materials within the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine. Russia must also authorize regular and unfettered access by facility personnel so as to ensure that the plants can be run safely. We call for full respect of the Convention on Nuclear Safety and other relevant conventions. France supports the efforts of the IAEA Director General to ensure ongoing monitoring of the safety and security of nuclear facilities in Ukraine, in close contact with the Ukrainian authorities. We ask the Director General to use all instruments available to the Agency to support Ukraine’s efforts to ensure the safety and security of all facilities around the country. In that regard, France supports the proposal of the Director General of the IAEA for negotiations on commitments between the parties to the armed conflict in Ukraine, with a view to ensuring respect for the seven principles set forth during the Board of Governors meeting held on 2 March on the implications of the situation in Ukraine in the areas of safety, security and nuclear safeguards. Finally, France reiterates its unwavering support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. Since 24 February we have witnessed the devastating human cost of Russian aggression. An immediate cessation of hostilities and the strict application of international humanitarian law is a matter of urgency; that is why France, along with Mexico, is putting forward a draft resolution with that goal in mind in order to put an end to the humanitarian tragedy that is unfolding before our eyes. Here, as in other cases, the Security Council must fully assume its responsibilities.","Today’s meeting is another attempt by Kyiv authorities to kindle artificial hysteria around what is happening in Ukraine, and they are being assisted in this by their Western backers. Today we have once again heard lies about how Russian troops attacked the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, and this is all part of an unprecedented campaign of lies and disinformation against Russia, which is trying to present the situation of the power plant as having allegedly been shelled by the Russian military as a result of which a fire broke out. These statements are simply untrue. The city of Energodar, the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant and the adjacent areas were brought under the control of the Russian army back on 28 February. As a result of negotiations with the management of the power plant, an agreement was reached to place it under the protection of the Russian military. The goal is to prevent Ukrainian nationalists or other terrorist forces from taking advantage of the current situation to organize a nuclear provocation. The goal is also to ensure the security of the station and prevent interruptions in power supply to the population of Ukraine and European consumers. At present, the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant and adjacent areas are being guarded by Russian troops. In order to do this, personnel with relevant experience, including experience in operating the engineering and technical facilities with which the nuclear power plant is equipped, have been brought in. The current situation is similar to that in the area of the Chernobyl power plant. The security of these facilities is being ensured jointly by the Russian armed forces and the Ukrainian operators of the nuclear installations. Our servicemen are not interfering in the work of the operators of he Ukrainian power plants; they are limiting their objectives merely to ensuring their security. As we were informed by the Russian Ministry of Defence, on the night of 4 March, while patrolling the protected area, but not the area of the power plant itself, rather the adjacent area, a Russian mobile patrol was attacked by a Ukrainian sabotage group. In order to provoke return fire on the building, small-arms fire was opened on Russian troops from the windows of several floors of the training complex located just outside the area of the nuclear power plant. The Russian patrol returned fire on the Ukrainian saboteurs’ firing points from the training complex and suppressed their fire. As they were leaving, the Ukrainian sabotage group set fire to the training facility. Let me emphasize once again that this building is not located on the territory of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. The fire brigades that arrived were able to extinguish the fire on the premises. At the time of this provocation, none of the regular employees of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant were on site in the training building. At present, the personnel of the power plant — who were not injured, as we were assured by the Permanent Representative of the United States — continues to work normally and is maintaining plant facilities and monitoring the radiation situation. The background radiation levels in the area of the nuclear power plant are normal. All the nuclear power plant’s facilities are under the control of the Russian military. Their security has been fully ensured, and the station continues to function normally, in accordance with technological requirements. The power units of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant were not damaged. Their condition is as follows. The first has been disconnected for repair. The second and third units have been temporarily disconnected by the decision of the station’s management. The fourth is operating at 690 megawatts, and the fifth and sixth are being cooled. According to the assessments of International Atomic Energy Agency leadership set out in the 4 March press statement, the operation of the nuclear power plant continues normally. Nothing is threatening the safety of the six power units. The radiation monitoring systems at the station are fully operational and there is no threat of a release of radioactive material. I would like to remind the Council that in 2014 Ukrainian nationalists tried to destabilize the situation at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant and in the city of Energodar. Western States ignored that egregious case back then, which could have led to disaster. We drew attention to that serious incident at the time. Now, when the Russian military is doing all it can to ensure the safety and security of Ukrainian nuclear facilities, a massive anti-Russian propaganda campaign is unfolding based on absurd allegations that Russia is trying to create a source of radioactive contamination. I urge the Council to consider — what would be the point of doing that? We are the best positioned to be aware and on top of the situation. We are also the party most interested in maintaining and ensuring nuclear, physical and general security in Ukraine. We are Ukraine’s neighbours. Together with the people of Belarus and Ukraine, we lived through the tragedy of Chernobyl. We are therefore more interested than most in maintaining a normal radiation levels throughout the territory of Ukraine. I would like to once again emphasize that the danger to the civilian population of Ukraine is not emanating from Russian troops, but rather from Ukrainian nationalists, who are holding the civilian populations of a number of large cities hostage and carrying out acts of sabotage and provocation, one of which we are now discussing. They then try to blame Russia for all of it. Yesterday’s incident at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant is a clear illustration of that. As to the reaction of my dear Western colleagues to this incident and their attempt to turn it into a global scandal, we have no doubt that the radicals and extremists in Ukraine were and are under the protection of these colleagues and therefore have carte blanche to do as they please. For the sake of their Ukrainian project, my Western colleagues are ready to forget about the future and well-being of ordinary Ukrainians, just as they tried to ignore the systematic shelling for eight years of the civilians of Donbas by the armed forces of Ukraine. We urge these colleagues to calm down their mentees, who, in the worst traditions of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant terrorists and their associates are hiding behind civilians, placing heavy weaponry and multiple rocket launchers in residential areas. In Mariupol, nationalists have detained 60 citizens who were on their way to the humanitarian corridor that was established and forced them to the thirty- fourth local school, which has been mined. Now those terrorists are using civilians as human shields and are blackmailing the advancing forces of the Donetsk People’s Republic with their readiness to blow up a school full of hostages. Furthermore, they are preventing civilians who wish to leave the cities from doing so. That practice is affecting not only Ukrainians, but also foreign citizens. The number of foreign nationals who are being forcibly held by Ukrainian nationalists is shocking. In Kharkiv, they are holding 3,189 citizens of India, up to 2,700 citizens of Viet Nam, 202 citizens of China. In Sumy, they are holding 576 Indian citizens, 101 Ghanian citizens and 121 Chinese citizens. In Chernihiv, nine Indonesian citizens are being held. Yesterday, in Kharkiv, nationalists fired on a group of Chinese citizens who were trying to independently leave into Russian territory, and two were injured. The Russian military is doing all it can to ensure the peaceful evacuation of foreign nationals. In the Belgorod region, at the Nekhoteyevka and Sudzha checkpoints, as of 6 a.m. today, 130 comfortable buses were stood ready to leave for Kharkiv and Sumy in order to rescue Indian students and other foreign citizens. Checkpoints have been equipped with temporary accommodations, rest facilities and hot meals, mobile medical stations have been equipped with stocks of medication. The evacuees will be later transported to Belgorod and, subsequently, brought home by air. I would like to draw the Council’s attention to another egregious episode, and we would ask the Secretariat’s Rapporteur to provide some clarification in that regard. The Telegram channel of the so-called territorial defence of Kramatorsk published a message about the requisitioning of cars of United Nations mission personnel. If the Secretariat is not aware of that, we are ready to provide the relevant materials. That message states: “Sorry, but the end justifies the means. We have requisitioned United Nations vehicles, as we need them now”. According to the nationalists, “there is full understanding on the part of the United Nations. There were no official statements or protests from the United Nations”. We are extremely concerned that United Nations mission vehicles could already be in the hands of terrorists and could be used for terrorist purposes. If the Secretariat is actually aware of this situation, as the nationalists claim, then we would like to receive an explanation of why the United Nations did not inform Member States. ","I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo and Mr. Grossi for their briefings. The United Kingdom and our partners called this urgent meeting because last night Russian forces attacked the largest nuclear power station in Europe. We are grateful to the Ukrainian firefighters and authorities who got the fire under control and are working bravely to ensure that the plant remains safe. We support the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Ukraine and are relieved that so far, it has reported that none of the safety systems in the plant were affected and that there was no release of radioactive material. This is the first time that a State has attacked a fuelled and functioning nuclear power plant. International law requires special protection for nuclear facilities, and it is difficult to see how Russia’s actions were compatible with its commitments under article 56 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts. It must not happen again. Even in the midst of an illegal invasion of Ukraine, Russia must keep fighting away from, and protect the safety and security of, nuclear sites. President Putin said yesterday that the special military operation — or, as everyone else calls it, the war — was going to plan. Everyone around this table knows that that is not true. President Putin misjudged the strength, resilience and will of the Ukrainian people with regard to his invasion. He underestimated the world’s condemnation of his actions. One hundred and forty-one votes in the General Assembly and the unprecedented sanctions on Russia demonstrate the strength of the global response. Every day that this war continues, the destruction that it brings to Ukraine, the suffering that it inflicts on Ukrainian and Russian people and the risks that it poses to international peace and security increase. That must stop. We call on Russia to end this violence, withdraw its troops and enter into serious peace negotiations. ","By the grace of God, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night. We all waited to exhale as we watched the horrific situation unfold in real time. I applaud the ability of the Ukrainian operators to keep all six reactors in safe conditions while under attack, and to report, as they were able, to their nuclear regulator. Moreover, we appreciate the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine for its continuous updates to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the international community. We are gravely concerned that the Ukrainian operators are now doing their jobs under extreme duress. Russia’s attack last night put Europe’s largest nuclear power plant at grave risk. It was incredibly reckless and dangerous and threatened the safety of civilians across Russia, Ukraine and Europe. As a first step, we call on Russia to withdraw its troops from the plant to permit medical treatment for injured personnel; to ensure that operators have full access to the site and are able to communicate with nuclear regulators; and to allow the operators to conduct shift changes to ensure the continued safe operation of the plant. Ukrainian firefighters and nuclear engineers must have full access to the nuclear facility to assess damage, particularly to water intake piping, and mitigate a further deterioration of the situation, if needed. Nuclear facilities cannot become part of this conflict. Reliable electricity is vital for the nuclear facility, as are backup diesel generators and fuel. Safe transit corridors must be maintained. Russia must halt any further use of force that might put at further risk all 15 operable reactors across Ukraine or interfere with Ukraine’s ability to maintain the safety and security of its 37 nuclear facilities and their surrounding populations. The United States remains highly concerned about the fact that Russian military forces controlling the Chernobyl site have not permitted operators there to have a shift change since last week. That is highly irresponsible behaviour and causes grave concerns for the continued safe operation of both sites. We call on all countries to support IAEA Director General Grossi in his efforts to find arrangements going forward to ensure nuclear safety and prevent a nuclear catastrophe in Ukraine. Over the past nine days, we have witnessed the devastating impacts of President Putin’s war of choice on the Ukrainian people. Yesterday, the United Nations reported that Russia’s invasion had turned half a million children into refugees. Russia has killed thousands of Ukrainians and sacrificed the lives of thousands more Russian soldiers in the process. Russia is destroying critical infrastructure, which is denying people drinking water to stay alive and gas to keep them from freezing to death in the middle of winter. The humanitarian impact of the destruction will be significant. Some 141 nations across the world have called loudly and clearly on President Putin to stop this brutal, unjustified, unprovoked attack. Not only has he not listened, but we have just witnessed a dangerous new escalation that represents a dire threat to all of Europe and the world. To my Russian counterparts, I say that the Council needs answers. We need to hear its representative say that this will not happen again, as our colleague of the United Kingdom just stated. We call on Russia to withdraw its troops and weaponry from Ukraine. We call on Russia to respect Ukraine’s borders, its people and the Charter of the United Nations. We call on Russia to respect its own troops enough not to send them into an unjust war or on a suicide mission against a nuclear power plant. We call on Russia to abide by its international law obligations. The world demands that Russia abide by international humanitarian law, which prohibits intentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, and allow humanitarian agencies full and secure access to people in need of aid. The United States and its partners have called for a briefing on Monday on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. We support the urgent work of humanitarian organizations on a humanitarian pause to allow for the safe passage and delivery of humanitarian supplies. President Putin must stop this humanitarian catastrophe by ending the war and ceasing these unconscionable attacks against the people of Ukraine. Mr. Putin must stop this madness and he must stop it now. Cooler heads must prevail. Russian forces are now 20 miles and closing from Ukraine’s second-largest nuclear facility, so the imminent danger continues. We narrowly avoided a disaster last night. The international community must be unanimous in demanding that Russia’s forces stop their dangerous assault. As I have said before, the people of Ukraine are counting on us, and we must not let them down. ","I would like to thank UnderSecretary-General DiCarlo , and we are happy that we could listen to Director General Grossi. I would like to reassure him of our full support in his efforts. Ten days into the so-called special operation — which, in reality, is Operation How To Invade Your Neighbour — and in the middle of a large-scale human tragedy, we are running towards an overall catastrophe, first, for Ukraine, as well as for Russia and, as we see every day, with serious implications for Europe at large. Thousands have been killed, including at least 2,000 civilians. According to United Nations reports, approximately 12 million people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance and 1 million have already fled the country — the fastest and largest mass exodus of people in complex situations in decades. All developments of the major geopolitical crisis, artificially created by Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified aggression against Ukraine, indicate unmistakably that it is headed towards further escalation. The adoption of General Assembly resolution ES-11/1 by an overwhelming majority just two days ago told Russia that it could not take the world hostage. Unfortunately, that loud call by the world asking Russia to stop its aggression has not been heard in Moscow, and Russia remains defiant and is stubbornly descending into an abyss. The world was alarmed late last night by the news of the fire at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power station, caused by Russian shelling. Thankfully, the huge blaze at the site of Europe’s largest nuclear power station was quickly extinguished, yet we remain gravely concerned, and it is alarming that Russian forces have captured the nuclear power plant. Russia’s grip on a plant that provides more than one-fifth of Ukraine’s electricity is a serious cause of concern that could have huge repercussions for civilians and Ukraine’s economy. Fighting at the plant or any other disturbance could cause a potential nuclear disaster or radioactive damage and have irreparable consequences for Europe’s environment. It is difficult not to recall the dreadful images of Chernobyl. We welcome the quick response of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IEAE) and the reassurance that we heard from Director Genera Grassi, with regard to operationalizing its Incident and Emergency Centre for a full response, owing to the gravity of the situation. They should be given urgent and unhindered access to verify and monitor the conditions and ensure that all safeguards are in place, as the situation remains very challenging. The Russian occupiers must immediately allow unfettered access for emergency service to the plant and whatever else is needed. We urge the IAEA to continue working closely with Ukraine with a view to providing maximum possible assistance to the country as it seeks to maintain nuclear safety and security in the current difficult circumstances. It is important for the nuclear power plant to continue to be operated by its regular staff. We are very concerned about the reports from the operator that the situation remains difficult. We call on Russia to end its aggression, withdraw its troops from Ukraine, halt the use of force near any nuclear power plant, and any civilian infrastructure in general, and respect article 56 of the Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions. Attacking civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes a crime and perpetrators must and will be held accountable. We welcome the establishment by the Human Rights Council of an international commission of inquiry to investigate war crimes committed in the aggression against Ukraine. Evidence must be gathered, documented and presented to the courts. For the purpose of accountability, we support the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in investigating and documenting crimes committed. As Dag Hammarskjöld famously said, the United Nations was not created to take humankind to heaven but to save it from hell. It falls upon the Council to do what it can and what is needed to save Ukraine, its people and the whole of Europe from the hell to which Russia is headed with its relentless aggression. ","I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo and the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, for their briefings, and I thank Director General Grossi for his urgent call for action today. We are here today because of our concern about the ongoing situation at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. The Russian Federation’s continuing unprovoked, unjustified invasion of Ukraine is wreaking havoc and destruction on Ukraine and its people. That aggression is inflicting enormous hardship and suffering. Ireland stands full square in unwavering solidarity with the people of Ukraine, who continue to show extraordinary courage and resilience in the face of that act of aggression. The parties to the conflict must comply with international humanitarian law. That includes the obligation not to attack civilian objects and clear prohibitions against indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks. It includes the obligation to take all feasible precautions in an attack. We demand nothing less than full respect for those obligations. The attack last night by Russian forces on the nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhya has shocked us all and sent a chilling signal across Europe, indeed, across the globe. That further reinforces the concerns arising from the armed takeover by Russia of the nuclear facilities in the Chernobyl exclusion zone just eight days ago. Ireland condemns the reckless firing against nuclear power plants. Armed attacks and threats against nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes constitute violations of international law, including the principles of the United Nations Charter, Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions and the IAEA Statute. Director General Grossi has made that point abundantly clear. In attacking such sites, the Russian Federation risks an environmental disaster compounding the extraordinary human tragedy that we are witnessing today in Ukraine. A radioactive release from any of those sites would also have serious repercussions for human life and health, agriculture and the environment in Ukraine, the Russian Federation itself and the wider European region. We call on the Russian Federation to fully respect its obligations under the United Nations Charter, international law and the IAEA Statute. All international nuclear safety and security standards must be maintained. We call on the Russian Federation to allow Ukrainian personnel at the plant do their work safely and without undue pressure. It is crucial that safety systems at the plant not be compromised. Power supply to the plant must be maintained. That is essential not just for the six reactors at this site but also for the spent fuel stored there. There should be no interruption of basic services, including energy to the population across Ukraine. Ireland commends the bravery and professionalism of the Ukrainian personnel at the plant and the Ukrainian nuclear regulator in seeking to ensure safety at the plant in very difficult circumstances. We are deeply concerned, however, for their safety and their well-being. At this worrying time, Ireland fully supports the work of the IAEA and its incident and emergency centre in its ongoing monitoring and assistance in respect of the nuclear safety and security situation in Ukraine. We believe that it will be important for the IAEA Director General to keep the Council informed regarding nuclear safety and security in Ukraine. Cavalier, reckless behaviour with dangerous forces such as nuclear power is utterly unacceptable. The prospect of a nuclear event at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant will have global impacts. We all saw what happened at Chernobyl and Fukushima. That is a spectre that no one at this table should be willing to countenance. The humanitarian implications of damage to civilian infrastructure cannot be overestimated. The electricity generated by the Zaporizhzhya plant powers homes and hospitals, ensuring that civilians can feed themselves and heat their homes and powering life-saving medical equipment. Let us be clear: civilian infrastructure should never be a target, and that must stop now. Once more Ireland urges the Russian Federation to immediately cease all hostilities, unconditionally withdraw from the entire territory of Ukraine and to refrain from further threats or the use of force of any kind against Ukraine or, indeed, any other Member State. To avert nuclear disaster, Ireland today calls most urgently for an immediate cessation of military activities at Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. We call for the competent Ukrainian authorities to be allowed to promptly regain full control over Zaporizhzhya and all their nuclear facilities. One more time, we call sincerely for a return to dialogue and diplomacy in good faith.","I thank Under-SecretaryGeneral Rosemary DiCarlo and the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, for their briefings to the Council. We also thank the IAEA for providing frequent, factual updates on matters within the Agency’s mandate. We called this meeting along with partners because this is an unjust war, unjustly fought. Norway condemns the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine. And now, as reported, we see shelling and fighting in the immediate vicinity of a civilian nuclear power plant. It takes little imagination to understand the possible consequences of such action. It shows a blatant disregard for Ukrainian lives, for Russian lives and indeed life in Europe and beyond. It is irresponsible and unacceptable. Civilians can never be a target. A nuclear power plant can never be a target. Yet this is only the latest in a string of assaults on homes, hospitals, schools, bridges, roads and other vital civilian infrastructure. Damage and destruction of a nuclear plant would put us all in danger. It can lead to a radioactive nightmare with the most severe long-term effects for generations. International humanitarian law is not optional. We call on Russia to fulfil its obligation to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure. These actions also violate the obligation under international humanitarian law to maintain the physical integrity of nuclear facilities and keep them safe at all times. And we recall the 2009 decision of the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency that “any armed attack on and threat against nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes constitutes a violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter, international law and the Statute of the Agency”. We commend the efforts of the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine to keep the international community updated on the status of nuclear safety and security in the country. And our thoughts go to the staff — the men and women — working at nuclear facilities in Ukraine under these dire circumstances. We laud their commitment to ensuring continuing nuclear safety and security. Their perseverance is an example to us all. Russia bears full responsibility for this act of aggression and all the destruction and loss of life it has caused and will continue to cause. We reiterate our call upon the Russian Federation to immediately withdraw its forces from Ukrainian territory and cease all threats and military actions, including in the vicinity of, and directed at, nuclear facilities. A ceasefire is desperately and urgently needed. Diplomacy must win."," I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo and Director General Grossi for their briefings. It is regrettable that the situation in Ukraine has worsened further since the Council last convened on this matter (see S/PV.8983). An immediate cessation of violence and end to all hostilities are essential. We continue to carefully follow the developments regarding the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear power reactors and facilities. India attaches the highest importance to ensuring the safety and security of nuclear facilities, as any accident involving nuclear facilities may have severe consequences for public health and the environment. India accords the highest priority to the discharge by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of its safeguards and monitoring activities, in accordance with its statute, in an effective, non-discriminatory and efficient manner. We also take note of the latest information available with regard to the nuclear power plants and facilities in Ukraine, including the updates provided today by the Director General of the IAEA on the current situation. While we are discussing the nuclear dimension of an unfolding conflict, the Council must acknowledge that there is a pressing humanitarian crisis confronting us in Ukraine, where the safety and security of innocent civilians including several thousand Indian nationals, in particular students, are at stake. We therefore hope that the second round of talks between the two sides contributes to the immediate establishment of a safe humanitarian corridor. As reiterated by my Prime Minister in his conversations with global leaders, including of the Russian Federation and Ukraine, differences must be resolved through sustained dialogue and diplomacy. Commitment to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, as well as respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States are key principles in that regard.","We thank Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo and Director General Grossi for their briefings. Like other delegations, I express my country’s concern about the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plan. Although the information we are receiving is that the nuclear reactors were not affected and that radiation levels have not increased, that does not diminish the seriousness of the incident or the possible consequences of a greater impact. The firing of missiles at or in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant violates the fundamental principle relating to the physical integrity of nuclear facilities, which must be secured at all times and under all circumstances. In 2009, the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) unanimously approved decision GC(53)/DEC/13, reaffirming resolutions adopted in 1985 and 1990, stating explicitly that “any armed attack on and threat against nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes constitutes a violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter ... international law”. It is also necessary to mention the concern about the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Any incident at these two plants or any other could have serious health and environmental repercussions. Just a week since the start of the conflict, there are already more than 1.2 million refugees. The additional humanitarian consequences of a radiological accident releasing radioactive material would be so serious that it is imperative to take all the preventive measures available to us to avoid it. There is no justification for military activities at these sites. They are clearly identifiable nuclear facilities and they are expressly prohibited from attack under international humanitarian law. The physical security of nuclear facilities, as well as the personnel guaranteeing their security, to which the IAEA Director General pointedly referred, must be maintained at all times. We support his initiative to ensure that the parties fully comply with their security commitments in the area of security for those facilities. The Zaporizhzhya incident should be added to a growing list of direct or collateral attacks on civilian infrastructure. International law, international humanitarian law and the conventions on nuclear physical security must be respected without exception. We call for the military action of the Russian Federation on Ukrainian territory to adhere to the principles of international law and the principle of proportionality of actions affecting civilian infrastructure, in particular nuclear facilities, equipment and radioactive materials. Mexico reiterates its support for the SecretaryGeneral’s appeal for an immediate ceasefire that would allow for urgent humanitarian action. That is precisely the objective pursued by France and Mexico in the draft resolution that we have submitted for the consideration of Council members."," I wish to thank you, Madam President, for convening this emergency meeting of the Security Council at this critical moment in the situation in Ukraine, and Under-SecretaryGeneral DiCarlo and Director-General Grossi for the information provided. Ghana is gravely concerned about the intensifying military escalations across several cities in Ukraine, in particular with the attack and shelling of sites close to nuclear power plants and facilities. It is a relief to learn that the situation at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant is currently stable and that radioactive emissions remain within acceptable range. Every effort must be made to mitigate the risk of accidental emissions, which pose an immeasurable threat to the lives of civilians and an already fragile environment. We urge the continued support of the International Atomic Energy Agency to provide necessary assistance to the Ukrainian authorities so as to ensure the safety and security of nuclear installations and staff present on site. We cannot forget the horrors of the 1986 Chernobyl accident and the consequent nuclear catastrophe, which have left in its wake long-term effects of radiation exposure to many people in Ukraine and parts of Europe even to date. Ghana strongly appeals to the parties to exercise restraint and halt the use of force in all areas of critical infrastructure, including the nuclear power plants, and to respect their international obligations to protect human lives and to prevent potential disasters. We take note of the ongoing diplomatic talks between the parties in Belarus and welcome the agreement reached to create a humanitarian corridor to allow for the evacuation of the millions of people caught up in the crossfires, as well as the considerations to provide food and medical supplies. Together with the international community, we express our strong support for the peaceful resolution of this conflict and urge further constructive engagements by the parties at all levels in the pursuit of their security interests and the maintenance of international peace and security."," I would like to thank you, Madam President, for convening this meeting and Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo and Director General Rafael Grossi for their presentations. We support and commend the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for remaining in constant contact with authorities in Ukraine and for fully discharging technical responsibilities and functions, as per the Agency’s statute and related instruments. We commend the Agency’s Director General for his offer to visit Ukraine and for his efforts to secure a commitment of all parties to ensuring the safety and security of nuclear facilities in the country. I am almost embarrassed to reiterate that we are facing unprecedented dire circumstances. Not only are we witnessing an appalling humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine, but now we are also confronted with the prospect of a nuclear incident of significant dimensions due to the situation in the nuclear facility in Zaporizhzhya. That is one more reason for the international community to strenuously call for an immediate and comprehensive cessation of all hostilities in Ukraine. We are under threat of a radioactive incident of major proportions, which could have enormous consequences not only for Ukraine but for all of Europe. The complete de-escalation of military actions is past due. The provisions of international humanitarian law must be respected in their entirety. The safety of millions of people is at stake and now also subjected a nuclear threat. In that regard, we appreciate Under-SecretaryGeneral DiCarlo for drawing the attention of the Council to article 56 of the first Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, according to which nuclear electrical generating stations “shall not be made the object of attack, even when those objects are military objectives, if such an attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population”. Allow me to add that article 56 also applies to “other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of those works or installations”. The IAEA General Conference has adopted a number of decisions on the protection of nuclear installations devoted to peaceful purposes against armed attacks, prohibition of attacks and threat of attack thereto. Those decisions must be respected at all times. Brazil calls on all parties to refrain from any measure or action that could jeopardize the security of nuclear materials, as well as the safe operation of all nuclear facilities in Ukraine, as any such incident could have severe and enduring consequences for human health and the environment. While expressing grave concern over the recent developments, we cannot turn a blind eye to the role that the Council should play but is not playing in the current situation. A number of meetings have been held in this Chamber on the situation in Ukraine. It seems that, no matter how many public meetings we convene, a ceasefire and the end of hostilities remain elusive. That is not a paradox, but rather a warning on the failure of the Council to act constructively in addressing the matter. Brazil urges all members here to engage truly and actively to promote dialogue and rebuild trust. The General Assembly recently adopted resolution ES11/1, urging Russia and Ukraine to seek a peaceful resolution of the conflict through political dialogue, negotiations, mediation and other peaceful means. This is the time not to further escalate the rhetoric, but to engage in conversations towards peace. There is an array of instruments available to the Council and to the parties under Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations. The Security Council has — we have — the responsibility to create an environment conducive to a ceasefire and to lasting peace. At this moment, we reiterate our appeal for a ceasefire and, most of all, for diplomacy."," I thank Under-SecretaryGeneral DiCarlo and Director General Grossi for their briefings. Kenya is deeply concerned by the reports made yesterday of a fire in the close vicinity of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant in Ukraine. It is with relief that we learned from the International Atomic Energy Agency that the reactor’s safety systems have not been affected and that radioactive material has not been released. There are few more dangerous installations containing dangerous forces than nuclear plants as regards the catastrophic humanitarian and environmental consequences of their destruction. On this occasion, good fortune intervened to safeguard the reactor. However, the fact that the armed conflict is still under way and features extensive ground, air and sea military operations means that the risk remains unacceptably high. Rarely has there been a more urgent need to observe international conventions regulating the conduct of armed conflict. We therefore call for adherence to the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, relating to the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts, particularly part IV of Protocol II, whose article 15 states: “Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.” Kenya also recalls resolution 2573 (2021), adopted in April 2021, the protection of objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, which highlights the significant effect that the destruction of essential infrastructure in many conflicts across the globe continues to have on civilians. Beyond the risk to nuclear plants, we urge that due caution be taken in any actions that may destroy civilian objects that are critical to the survival of Ukrainians. Harm to them can lead to an escalation of the armed conflict and make it all the more difficult to resolve. Kenya calls for the military leaderships of Ukraine and the Russian Federation to establish mechanisms to reduce the targeting and threat to critical infrastructure. Such a mechanism can mirror the agreement made yesterday by both sides to the conflict to establish a humanitarian corridor, as well as a temporary local ceasefire, to enable aid deliveries. We encourage the continuation of that positive dialogue and call on the Russian Federation to urgently enter into negotiations to settle the conflict by peaceful means. Finally, we take note of the resolution adopted yesterday by the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors. We thank the Director General for his regular updates and continuing efforts to ensure safety and security in all facilities in the country."," I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the United Arab Emirates. I thank Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo and Director General Rafael Grossi for their briefings. My country too is following the situation at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant with deep concern. The reports that we have received about fires affecting the plant suggest a dangerous development in the conflict. The humanitarian and environmental catastrophe resulting from a serious nuclear incident would be hard to contain and recovery would be difficult. We clearly remember Fukushima and Chernobyl. The human costs are indeed incalculable in terms of both human health and the environment. We all must prevent such accidents from happening again. The parties must therefore ensure the safety of the plant, as well as its reactors. They must also ensure that the plant and the surrounding area are not a target and remain protected from conflict, as damage to the plant could lead to dire consequences for the entire region. For that reason, we urge all the relevant parties involved to cooperate with the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ensure and protect the safety of nuclear facilities in Ukraine and to establish a stable framework on the ground. There are clear reasons for having special protections in place under international humanitarian law for facilities such as nuclear power plants. We again stress that any direct attack on a nuclear facility has the potential to lead to catastrophic and unimaginable consequences. Nuclear safety is a critical issue for my country. Our participation on the IAEA’s Board of Governors is a recognition of that concern. We will continue to make every possible effort to promote and maintain nuclear safety, and we support the Director General of the IAEA’s proposal for negotiations between the parties around this matter and the implementation of agreed procedures. We also welcome the second round of bilateral talks between Ukraine and Russia yesterday. The Security Council is responsible for maintaining international peace and security. As we know, nuclear threats are among the most devastating threats to humankind. The Council must make every possible effort to avoid a nuclear disaster, whether from direct attack on a nuclear facility or as an unintended consequence of conflict. Such a disaster would have grave ramifications for generations to come. With regard to the conflict today, we again reiterate our call for a cessation of hostilities, for de-escalation and for dialogue mechanisms to be leveraged and supported by all of us. The risks of a failure in diplomacy are too grave to consider. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. I give the floor to Ms. DiCarlo to respond to any comments and questions.",,"First of all, I would like to express my gratitude for the immediate reaction by the Under-Secretary-General to the lies of the Russian representative. We are all accustomed to the lies. “We have survived the night that could have stopped the history of Ukraine and Europe,” said the President of Ukraine this morning. Indeed, every day provides us with newer and newer evidence that it is not only Ukraine under Russian attack; it is Europe; it is the entire world; it is humankind; and, finally, it is the future of the next generations. Russia seems to be furious that its plans to quickly invade Ukraine have already failed. Russia is furious that the Ukrainian people continue to courageously fight for its freedom. Russia is furious about the worldwide solidarity with Ukraine. In retaliation, Russia has resorted to war crimes and crimes against humanity. Russia does not even try to hide them. Residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages across the country are being ruined by Russian bombs, shells and missiles. Peaceful civilians are being killed. Critical infrastructure is totally damaged. Just yesterday, Russian air strikes killed 47 peaceful residents of the city of Chernihiv, including children. But that is not enough for Russia, or terror Russia, as one may already call it, because yesterday it committed an act of nuclear terrorism while shelling and seizing the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant in the town of Energodar. The lies of the Permanent Representative of Russia are not surprising. He may not be properly informed by his capital, and we saw that on many occasions in the Security Council. He had no idea what his capital and what the President were planning to do in the middle of one of our recent meetings. I would therefore not really rely on his words. As a result of the shelling on the territory of the nuclear power plant, a fire broke out, killing and injuring several people. The Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant site, as well as the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, is currently under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. Employees of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant are monitoring the condition of the power units and ensuring their operation, in accordance with the requirements of the technical regulations for safe operation. It is alarming that several employees responsible for maintaining nuclear security at the site were reportedly killed by Russian soldiers. There has been no rotation of personnel since yesterday morning. The building of Unit 1 main building is damaged. The overpass of the special building is damaged. The telephone line connection is disrupted and not available at the moment. The stage of the power units now is as follows. Unit 1 is in outage. Its main building is damaged. The overpass of the special building is damaged. Units 2 and 3 have been disconnected from the grid and the cooldown of the nuclear installations is being carried out. Unit 4 is in operation at 690 megawatts of power. Units 5 and 6 are being cooled down. State nuclear safety inspectors of the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine are not allowed access to the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant site. Changes in the radiation situation have not been registered. Data from the automated radiation monitoring system of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant do not work. The cooling of the nuclear fuel within the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power units is maintained by dedicated systems of power units, in accordance with the requirements of the technical regulations for safe operation. If, at any point, the cooling process is disturbed, that could cause radioactive damage across large territories and have irreparable consequences for the environment of the entire continent. Thousands of people, including civilians, who are currently unable to evacuate the area near the plant due to the ongoing shelling and fighting, would be affected. I turn now to a pair of lies by the Russian Ambassador about the foreign students. This is an appalling example of gaslighting and an example of what he probably intended to present as almost an angelic message of peace. But let me remind him and all of us that Satan was also an angel — an angel that rebelled against God. I would like to ask the Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation if he is still able to communicate with his capital, which is probably not the case. Who knows? I ask the Russian representative to appeal to the armed forces to ensure a safe corridor, to allow the foreign students to leave the areas of concern and to stop spreading lies. He knows very well what is going on there if he is indeed in contact with his capital. The result of a nuclear disaster on such a scale — God forbid were it to happen — could exceed all previous accidents at nuclear power plants, including the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear power plant disasters. Russia has deliberately undertaken an armed attack against a nuclear power site — an action that has violated all international agreements with the IAEA, in particular the Agency’s Statute and Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency and the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities. The shelling of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant is also a gross violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. We are disappointed by the reaction of the IAEA, whose statement did not go as far as to include any mention of the attacking side. We demand clear and decisive action from the IAEA. The international community must respond adequately to the actions of the Russian Federation, which could lead to an unprecedented nuclear catastrophe. All Russian forces must be withdrawn from the nuclear power plant. Today, I have sent a letter to the President of the Security Council, recalling the Council’s decisions on no-fly zones during previous conflicts in order to prevent further civilian casualties, protect the civilian population from air attacks, including humanitarian personnel, and ensure access for humanitarian assistance and evacuation. In that regard, we ask the Council to consider the issue of protection of nuclear power plants and other critical infrastructure in Ukraine. Urgent discussion on establishing a ban on all flights in the airspace over Ukraine should be a top priority for the Security Council. We would also like to recall that, on 30 March 2015, in a letter to the President of the Security Council, contained in document S/2015/225, Ukraine requested the deployment of an international peacekeeping and security operation in the territory of Ukraine, with the exact modalities to be defined in consultations with the Ukrainian side, while taking into account that Russia’s armed forces could not be a part of the peacekeeping contingent because it is precisely the occupation armed forces that should be separated to maintain a ceasefire and peace. The failure of the Security Council to act, especially owing to the position of the Russian Federation as a party to the conflict, would be the historical responsibility of the Security Council and the entire Organization. I should like to ask Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo to forward our request to Secretary-General Guterres to ensure that every single body of the United Nations and every employee of the Secretariat respects General Assembly resolution ES-11/1 of 2 March and does not deviate from the language of the resolution or substitute it with ambiguities or falsities like “special military forces”, when it is called aggression against Ukraine. A week of full-fledged Russian invasion has already resulted in thousands of people killed, more than 1 million refugees and destroyed infrastructure. It is already the shared duty of the international community to stop the Russian murderers and terrorists by closing the skies over Ukraine, supporting Ukraine in terms of security and humanitarian assistance and expelling Russians from international institutions, as they do not deserve to be among civilized and responsible nations. Einstein said that the world will not be destroyed by those who do evil — the Ukrainians can deal with evil — but by those who watch them without doing anything. The people of Ukraine are doing more than they can, including by paying the ultimate price — paying with their lives. Yet still, shamefully, there is a handful of those among us who do nothing. We must act now or it may be too late, not only for Ukraine, but for all of us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S/PV.8983,28/02/2022,"Briefings on humanitarian and military situations in Ukraine; discussion of the Russian aggression against Ukraine (24 February Invasion, continued)","I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Griffiths and High Commissioner Grandi for their briefings. What is now unfolding in Ukraine is indeed heart-wrenching. We call on all the parties to exercise restraint, de-escalate the situation and prevent civilian casualties. The safety and security of the lives and property of all civilians, including foreign nationals, and their humanitarian needs, should be effectively guaranteed. Preventing a large-scale humanitarian crisis is of the utmost importance. We welcome the remarks by the Secretary-General indicating that the United Nations will play an active role in coordinating the humanitarian assistance. In our view, the United Nations and the international community should provide humanitarian assistance in accordance with the principles of humanity, neutrality and impartiality, as set forth in General Assembly resolution 46/182, in order to prevent the politicization of humanitarian action. The most important thing for the time being is to return to the track of diplomatic negotiations and a political settlement as soon as possible, and to promote a de-escalation of the situation. China supports holding direct dialogue between Russia and Ukraine, which is the way to ultimately resolve the crisis. The international community should foster favourable external conditions for dialogue and a political settlement, and refrain from exacerbating the situation. Any action by the Council should help play a constructive role, rather than leading to further escalation.","I thank Mr. Griffiths and Mr. Grandi for their briefings. The humanitarian consequences of the Russian offensive in Ukraine are dire. The number of civilian casualties, including children, continues to rise. Cities are being bombed. Civilian infrastructure has been destroyed. About 500,000 people have been forced to flee and take refuge in Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Moldova. That number is increasing every hour. France salutes the solidarity shown by Ukraine’s neighbours. Russia, a permanent member of the Council, is violating the most fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations. It is riding roughshod over international humanitarian law. It is violating human rights and trampling on the Geneva Conventions. France reiterates its call for an immediate cessation of hostilities, which must come before any peace talks. The protection of civilians, including children and humanitarian personnel, as well as civilian infrastructure, is a top priority, and France will not compromise on that. France reiterates its call for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to all people in need. We have a collective responsibility and a moral duty to help the Ukrainian people. France and its European Union partners stand firmly alongside Ukraine and its population. The European Union has already announced €90 million in humanitarian aid, in which France is playing its part. France has just sent 33 tons of humanitarian aid to Poland to help Ukrainians and is preparing to send more than 30 tons to Moldova. France welcomes the launch tomorrow by the United Nations of an emergency response plan for Ukraine and of a plan to help Ukrainian refugees in the region, and we call on all Member States to contribute financially. France also welcomes the Secretary-General’s appointment of Mr. Amin Awad as United Nations Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine. The sanctions adopted by the European Union against Russia and Belarus will be implemented with full regard for international humanitarian law, and we will ensure that they have no impact on the humanitarian response. Together with Mexico, France is preparing a draft resolution for the Council, calling for full respect for international humanitarian law, the protection of civilians and unhindered humanitarian access in order to meet the urgent needs of the Ukrainian population, to be put to a vote as soon as possible. France salutes the courage shown by the people of Ukraine. Within the United Nations and in all forums France will continue to work with its partners to mobilize support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. ","In accordance with rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite the representative of Ukraine to participate in this meeting. In accordance with rule 39 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite the following briefers to participate in the meeting: Mr. Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, and Mr. Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. Without a doubt, all of us are very concerned about the situation in Ukraine. We can see the suffering of ordinary people, who have basically become hostages of Ukrainian radicals and nationalists who desperately are clinging to power. I say that because the people in the areas under the control of the Russian armed forces are not encountering acute humanitarian issues. Once the radicals have left, the local authorities are working normally and providing all the necessary services to the people. Life-sustaining infrastructure is functioning. The acute issues are only in towns where the Ukrainian authorities issued a criminal and irresponsible order to distribute arms to anyone who wants them, including criminals who had been released from prisons for that purpose. That has resulted in mass incidents of robberies, killings and looting. There is plenty of information about that on social media. There are also appeals on social media by heads of some local administrations calling on Ukrainian authorities to stop the madness. There have also been many cases in which victims of looters and bandits are shamelessly said to have died at the hands of so-called Russian subversive groups. I address the people of Kyiv, who are held in the city by the radicals as human shields. The Russian Ministry of Defence confirms that all the peaceful citizens of Kyiv can leave the capital of Ukraine without hindrance via the Kyiv-Vasylkiv road. That road is open and safe. We repeat again that the goal of Russia’s special military operation is not to occupy Ukraine or to harm the local population. The demilitarization of Ukraine, which is packed with NATO weapons, is aimed at protecting the long-suffering people of Donbas and Ukraine. Russia’s special operation does not impact critical civilian infrastructure. Over the five days of the operation, there have been no recorded cases of targeted destruction. Similarly, there is no evidence of the Russian military causing the death of civilians. Yet we are constantly being told the opposite, with a reference to some kind of credible reports. The widespread fake information is used to blame us for what Ukraine itself is doing. This flow of blatant lies, replicated by Western media, unfortunately has become a dangerous sign of our time. At this Security Council meeting, we heard once again about the bombings of residential areas, hospitals, schools and kindergartens. It is well known that Ukrainian radicals are deploying assault weapons in residential areas, which constitutes a direct violation of international humanitarian law. We ask Martin Griffiths and Filippo Grandi to comment on that. Everyone is well aware that, starting in 2014, Russia and Russia alone has provided assistance to the civilian population of Donbas, who were faced with constant shelling by the Ukrainian army and the blockade imposed by Kyiv. We have already explained our approach in several Security Council meetings, and I will not repeat that. Let me just say that we deeply regret the fact that, even today when we discuss the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, not a single Western colleague has mentioned the people of Donbas. Rather, the West has chosen to ignore their suffering for the past eight years. An important support measure for the people of Donbas was the 2019 decree by the President of Russia, Mr. Putin, entitled “On defining for humanitarian purposes categories of persons entitled to apply for citizenship of the Russian Federation via a simplified procedure”. At a time when the people of south-eastern Ukraine were pushed to the brink of survival by the criminal authorities in Kyiv, who had organized a socioeconomic blockade of Donbas, providing them with Russian citizenship allowed them to receive social benefits, pensions and salaries, as well as education and health-care services. Currently, in Russia there are more than 110,000 refugees from Donbas. They had to leave their homes a week ago when Kyiv made another attempt to “solve” the problem of Donbas by military means, in violation of the Minsk package of measures. The blame for that situation also belongs to our Western colleagues, because they openly indulged Kyiv when it rejected the Minsk package of measures and filled the country with weapons. By our estimates, since the beginning of the conflict in 2014, approximately 3 million Ukrainians have moved to Russia. In conclusion, let me reiterate that Russia did not start the war, but rather is trying to end it. Ukraine started the war in 2014, but the international community has tried to ignore it all these years. It was strange to hear the representative of France say that the European sanctions against Russia do not violate international humanitarian law or the interests of ordinary people in Russia. We have heard such duplicitous claims before in the context of other country situations. With regard to the draft resolution on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine proposed by France and Mexico, we need to study the text closely before we can make any assessments. In any case, Council members should know that the Russian military will provide any necessary humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine in the territories that have been freed from the radicals. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine. There are no more names inscribed on the list of speakers. I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the Russian Federation before I adjourn the meeting. I would like to say that I was surprised at the comments by the briefers. Some reports, footage and messages about the developments in Ukraine are taken for granted, while others, although obvious and undoubtedly true, are deemed to be unconfirmed and unverified. We will share some videos with members. We expect the United Nations leadership to comment on how such acts by Ukrainian radicals should be perceived. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. As this is the last scheduled meeting of the Council for the month of February, on behalf of the Russian Federation, I would like to express our sincere appreciation to the members of the Council and to the Secretariat for all their support. It has been a very busy month, but we managed to reach consensus on several important issues within our purview, although, as members know, not on all of them. I would like to again thank all the representatives of the Secretariat, including conference services, interpreters and translators, verbatim reporters and security staff. Our presidency is coming to an end. I know I speak on behalf of the Council in wishing the delegation of the United Arab Emirates good luck in the month of March. ","I would like to begin by thanking today’s briefers, Mr. Filippo Grandi and Mr. Martin Griffiths. As a result of President Putin’s decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a country of 44 million people is now on the brink of humanitarian catastrophe. Whatever my Russian colleague claims, the world can see Russia’s indiscriminate attacks on men, women and children across Ukraine and its disregard for international humanitarian law. Missiles have rained down on Kharkiv, with cluster munitions hitting residential areas and injuring residents. Disruptions to supply chains have caused food shortages in Kramatorsk. The reckless bombing of an oil depot in Vasylkiv has unleashed toxic fumes in nearby communities. The violence in Kyiv has forced people to seek refuge underground, with many thousands, including the elderly and disabled, unable to evacuate. And as we have heard from the United Nations, as of today, hundreds of civilians have been killed as a result of the Russian invasion. My Russian colleagues may try to paint the United Nations reporting as hysteria, just as they said it was Western hysteria to warn of their impending invasion. But let us look at the facts. Half a million people have already fled to Poland, Hungary, Romania, Moldova, Slovakia and other countries. Seven million people have been displaced, and that figure, as the High Commissioner for Refugees told us, is rising exponentially. United Nations agencies and humanitarian partners have been forced to suspend operations. As the High Commissioner stated, in this moment of urgent need the situation the agencies are facing is impossible. The United Kingdom stands with the Ukrainian people during their time of need. Yesterday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced $54 million in aid to help our Ukrainian friends. That latest assistance package brings the total amount of United Kingdom Government aid pledged to Ukraine this year to $190 million. Last week, Mr. Johnson also announced that the United Kingdom would guarantee up to $500 million in loans to Ukraine through the multilateral development banks. The United Kingdom will also participate in tomorrow’s United Nations appeal. United Kingdom Government experts have deployed to the region to provide humanitarian support to those fleeing violence in Ukraine. But we know that a humanitarian response is not enough to save the Ukrainian people from the disaster that Russia is inflicting on them. Our message today is therefore simple. Once again, for the sake of humanity, we call on President Putin to stop this war and withdraw his forces from Ukraine. ","I thank Mr. Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, and Mr. Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, for their truly sobering briefings. I think they underscore what the Secretary-General has said, which is that this is a moment of great peril and great tragedy. I thank their agencies and their teams for answering the call to help Ukrainians in need during this dire hour. In a matter of days, Russia’s unprovoked and premeditated invasion has unleashed vast human suffering across Ukraine. We need to address the displacement and refugee crisis that we have just heard described. We need to address the food-security crisis. And we need to document and address all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Council just heard the latest displacement numbers, which have been rising by the hour in the last four days. First it was 50,000 fled. Then it was 150,000 fled. Now it is half a million people who have fled. That does not even include the hundreds of thousands displaced internally within Ukraine. Behind each of those numbers are real people caught in a humanitarian nightmare unfolding before our eyes. The truth is, no one knows where it will end, how many people will flee their homes, how many will need humanitarian assistance or how many will die. That is because we do not know when President Putin will end his war of choice against Ukraine. I want to thank the many countries and the people in the region who have opened their borders and homes to fleeing Ukrainians. The safety they are providing underscores our common humanity during an otherwise dark moment of war. I want to echo the calls of the United Nations Refugee Agency. We should help and welcome all those fleeing conflict, without regard to race or nationality. Refugees are refugees, regardless of race or creed. Of course, not everyone can or will choose to flee, and those who remain in Ukraine must be assured unobstructed protection and assistance. Four days into the invasion, our humanitarian partners have already identified cash, fuel constraints, volatile security conditions and logistical challenges as key operational constraints affecting all aid delivery in the country. We also need to be very concerned about the hunger that Russia’s invasion will cause. The World Food Programme is warning us that the food-security impact of Russia’s invasion will be felt far beyond Ukraine’s borders. The Black Sea basin is one of the world’s most important areas for grain and agricultural exports. Vulnerable people from Asia to Africa and the Middle East will face greater levels of food insecurity as supplies are disrupted, as we are already seeing. An estimated 283 million people in more than 80 countries are acutely food insecure or at high risk, and the conflict in Ukraine will only exacerbate situations already on the brink of starvation. That is yet another reason why hostilities must end now. Finally, we are gravely concerned about the reports of damage to apartment buildings and schools, as well as significant infrastructure damage that has left hospitals and hundreds of thousands of people without electricity or water, while bridges and roads are damaged by shelling. It will be critical to ensure adherence to international humanitarian law, including obligations related to the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure. Humanitarian agencies must be granted secure and full access to people in need of aid. Tomorrow, as we have heard, the United Nations will be launching a funding appeal, an appeal for this humanitarian crisis. For its part, the United States is already providing nearly $54 million in additional humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. The United States Agency for International Development has been airlifting and positioning relief supplies, which are especially needed to help older people, people with disabilities and those displaced from their homes face the winter weather. That is just the beginning, and much more is coming. We welcome the commitments and leadership of other nations aimed at ensuring that life-saving assistance reaches those most in need. No matter what happens next, we must do absolutely everything that we can to help the people of Ukraine.","I would like to thank UnderSecretary-General Griffiths and High Commissioner Grandi for their startling updates on the catastrophic situation unfolding in Ukraine. Russia’s unprovoked aggression is causing an unprecedented humanitarian situation in Ukraine on a scale that Europe has not seen in decades. We all know the toll of war. In every conflict, it is the civilian populations that bear the worst of the consequences and pay the highest price. Conflicts mean innocent victims, destruction, displacement, refugees and severe human suffering, and those who initiate conflicts know that. As we have heard, the situation is alarming. Mr. Grandi mentioned the staggering numbers of hundreds of thousands of people on the move in and out of Ukraine, and all of it happening in just a few days. Women, children, the elderly and people with disabilities are currently the most in need. As the aggression goes on, civilians everywhere in Ukraine are terrified of what awaits them, wondering when rockets will fall on their roofs and in what other ways this absurd war will affect them. International law is clear about the fact that targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes a serious crime and its perpetrators must be held accountable. There is no justification for this war, just as there is no justification for the destruction of bridges, the deliberate targeting of infrastructure and the launching of missiles in residential areas. We are happy to hear that despite the hostilities, the United Nations operation in Ukraine has expanded. We support a strong and reinforced presence of the United Nations and humanitarian partners on the ground. We support ensuring safe, protected, unimpeded access for humanitarian workers and their deliveries to areas affected by conflict. Our message is clear. Civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected; security and access for humanitarian efforts must be guaranteed; safe and unhindered access for humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and its people should remain a priority; international humanitarian law and international human rights law, in particular, the four Geneva Conventions and their first Additional Protocol, must be upheld; and human rights violations and other crimes must be documented for the purposes of accountability. We commend all the countries that are hosting refugees. As Prime Minister Rama announced last week, we are happy to shelter Ukrainians who have been forced to flee because of the war. Albania is participating in the wide array of sanctions recently adopted by the European Union and will close its airspace to all Russian operators except for flights conducted for emergency and humanitarian needs. We are working to provide assistance in the form of military and hospital supplies to Ukraine. The decisions and actions made in the coming days will directly affect the lives of millions of people. What is happening in Ukraine should not happen anywhere. We need peace, not war. We need friendship, not aggression. We will continue to stand with Ukraine.","I would like to thank UnderSecretary-General Griffiths and High Commissioner Grandi for their sobering briefings and urgent calls to action today. The Russian Federation’s unprovoked and unjustified further invasion of Ukraine continues to visit death and destruction on the country and its people, inflicting enormous hardship and suffering. Ireland stands in unwavering solidarity with the Government and people of Ukraine. They have shown extraordinary courage and resilience. This fresh onslaught comes on the heels of eight years of conflict in eastern Ukraine, where 1.4 million people were already displaced and relying on assistance to meet their daily needs. The Russian Federation’s invasion has created a humanitarian catastrophe, compounding the suffering of millions with a rapidly rising toll of internally displaced persons and refugees in need of humanitarian assistance. Millions of people in Ukraine are grappling with the humanitarian consequences of a war not of their making. Innocent civilians, including children, are paying the terrible price of conflict. In Kharkiv, Kherson and elsewhere, we have seen significant damage to essential infrastructure that has left hundreds of thousands of people without electricity and water. It has deprived them of vital medical facilities, transportation services and means of communication. That is unacceptable. The parties to the conflict must comply with international humanitarian law, including the obligation to attack only military objectives, the prohibitions on indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks and the obligation to take all feasible precautions in attacks. Ireland is gravely concerned about the use of explosive weapons in populated areas, which carries a particular risk of harming civilians and is in violation of those fundamental legal obligations. We are particularly concerned about the reports of the indiscriminate Russian attacks and shelling in Kharkiv, which are causing death and destruction among the civilian population. There have been reports that Russian forces have used banned cluster munitions. If confirmed, that will be a further damning indictment of Russia’s military aggression. Cluster munitions are indiscriminate by their very nature, and we condemn any use of them in any circumstances. Ireland urges against attacks on infrastructure and installations, including nuclear power plants. Such attacks could have profound effects on the health of millions and render the surrounding environments uninhabitable for generations to come. Any armed attack or threat against nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes constitutes a violation of international law, including the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the first Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions and the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency. We are also deeply concerned about the deployment of weapons and armaments and the conduct of missile strikes directly from the Chernobyl exclusion zone. The Russian Federation must protect all civilians in Ukraine. We recall its obligations to respect international humanitarian law and human rights law. The safety of all humanitarian and medical workers must be assured. Humanitarian actors must not be prevented from ensuring the delivery of principled assistance where and when it is most needed. Ireland and its European Union (EU) partners are providing significant humanitarian support and we stand ready to do more. We commend our EU partners and Moldova for their generosity and solidarity in providing shelter to hundreds of thousands of people fleeing the war. They are deserving of our support in providing timely humanitarian assistance, especially to the most vulnerable — the elderly, the young and the sick. We appeal to all countries in the region to keep their borders open to all who are seeking safety and protection. Ireland is already providing humanitarian support, including core funding to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We also recently announced a €10 million humanitarian package. When conflicts rage, outcomes that are unpredictable and even barely conceivable can become all too real. Threats to unleash forces that cannot be controlled, including threats of nuclear weapons, are utterly unacceptable. Ireland has long argued that nuclear weapons offer no security. Their use would cause devastation in the region and beyond, bringing a new blight on humankind for generations to come. That is not a prospect that any of us should be willing to contemplate. We urge the Russian Federation to immediately cease hostilities, withdraw unconditionally from the entire territory of Ukraine and refrain from further threats or the use of force of any kind against Ukraine or any other Member State. In sum, we urge Russia to turn away from war and choose the path of dialogue and diplomacy. That is the right path, and the time to take it is now, before any more lives are ruined or lost.","Let me first thank Mr. Martin Griffiths, the Emergency Relief Coordinator, and Mr. Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, for their frank accounts of the Russian invasion’s consequences for civilians in Ukraine. We need their strong leadership in the response to the unfolding humanitarian crisis. Norway is stepping up its support to the civilian population in Ukraine. Our Government has announced that it will provide up to $226 million to the humanitarian response. Let me start by underlining that Russia, and Russia alone, bears sole responsibility for this humanitarian crisis. Through its unprovoked, unjustified and irresponsible military aggression, it has blatantly violated Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The parties to the conflict in Ukraine must comply with their obligations under international law, including international human rights law and international humanitarian law. They must ensure the protection of the civilian population throughout Ukraine. We demand that all the parties ensure that everything and everyone engaged exclusively in medical duties — medical personnel, hospitals and other medical facilities, along with their means of transport and equipment — are respected and protected. We call on the parties to the conflict to protect all humanitarian personnel and ensure and facilitate safe, rapid and unimpeded access to humanitarian aid for those in need. The space for neutral, impartial and independent humanitarian action must be restored and protected. There is ongoing fighting in and around urban areas, including the use of heavy explosive weapons. We are deeply concerned about the long-term harm that it will cause to civilians, including children, and civilian infrastructure. Homes, schools, hospitals, waterworks and other civilian infrastructure are being damaged and destroyed. We are also very concerned about the reported use of cluster munitions. Explosive remnants of war will continue to kill and injure even after a conflict ends and prevent people from returning home, going to school, returning to work and rebuilding their communities. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are fleeing the conflict. We commend the neighbouring countries for keeping their borders open and for the great generosity and solidarity that they have shown to the people fleeing the conflict. The door to safety and protection must remain open to all in need, without discrimination. We will do our part, including by providing support. Two media workers were shot and injured this weekend. Journalists and media workers are civilians under international humanitarian law. The world relies on independent and truthful reporting of the events that are unfolding. The heroic efforts by the Ukrainian and international press are incredibly important. We urge all parties to respect and protect the press, both on the ground and online. We demand the unconditional withdrawal of Russia’s troops from the territory of Ukraine in order to restore respect for the Charter of the United Nations and international law and prevent further civilian suffering. Russia started the war in Ukraine, and it can choose to stop it now."," I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Martin Griffiths and High Commissioner Filippo Grandi for their briefings. India remains deeply concerned about the developments in Ukraine, where the situation continues to deteriorate. Our well-considered calls for an immediate cessation of violence and an end to all hostilities are an urgent imperative. India’s Prime Minister advocated that strongly in his recent conversations with the leaders of the Russian Federation and Ukraine, whose commencement of direct talks we welcome. We reiterate our belief that differences can be bridged only through sustained dialogue and diplomacy. We also underline that all Member States have agreed on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, international law and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. There is an urgent and pressing humanitarian situation developing in Ukraine. In such times of conflict, India considers that the safety and well-being of civilians, especially women, children and the elderly, are the top priority. We believe that the core principles of humanitarian assistance should be fully honoured. Taking into account the humanitarian requirements in Ukraine, my Government has also decided to provide urgent relief supplies, including medicines, that will be dispatched tomorrow. We remain deeply concerned about the safety and security of the thousands of Indian citizens, including students, who are stranded in Ukraine. Our evacuation efforts have been adversely affected by the developments on the ground at Ukraine’s border crossings. Given that the safety of Indian nationals is of paramount importance to my Government, senior ministers from the Government of India are being deployed to Ukraine’s neighbours as special envoys, and we thank those countries for their cooperation at this difficult time. We stand ready to help people from India’s own neighbours and from developing countries who are also stranded in Ukraine and may be seeking assistance. We also support all United Nations humanitarian efforts. As we reiterated yesterday, there is no option but to return to the path of diplomacy and dialogue. That is the only way ahead.","I thank Mr. Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and Mr. Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, for their briefings. The numbers that have just been shared with us and the scene described reflect a humanitarian situation that is worsening with each passing hour. That is why, among other actions, Mexico and France will present a draft resolution aimed at achieving a general cessation of hostilities, the protection of civilians and guaranteed access to humanitarian aid. We deplore the continuing clashes in such densely populated cities as Kharkiv, Odessa, Kyiv and others. The use of explosive weapons in populated areas is unacceptable. It is also very worrying that large sectors of the population no longer have electricity, water or access to basic infrastructure. Communities are becoming isolated and facing shortages of food and medicine. Health services should be preserved at all costs. We call for ensuring that all humanitarian workers are enabled access so that they can provide services without any restrictions. As we have heard, hundreds of thousands of people are now displaced in Ukraine, in addition to those who are seeking refuge in neighbouring countries. The numbers, although still very preliminary, are already alarming and are growing rapidly. We will have more clarity on this escalation in the coming days, weeks, months and perhaps even in the coming years. We call for borders to be kept open, as has so far been accomplished with great solidarity so that all those seeking protection have been able to find it. We also call for respect for the principle of non-refoulement. Nonetheless, although we recognize the right of States to legitimate self-defence, the substantial increase in the flow of weapons and the impact that it will have on the civilian population is no less worrying. We acknowledge the efforts of the SecretaryGeneral, including the establishment of the Central Emergency Response Fund, and we appreciate the financial commitments that several States have already announced. We now need international economic solidarity if Ukraine is to meet its growing needs for humanitarian support. Finally, Mexico calls unequivocally on all parties to respect international humanitarian law, in particular the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and its first additional protocol of 1977, as well as international human rights law.","At the outset, let me thank Under-Secretary-General Martin Griffiths and High Commissioner Filippo Grandi for their very sobering briefings, which unfortunately confirm the images we are seeing in the media. Ghana is seriously concerned about the humanitarian situation unfolding in Ukraine. Today’s briefings highlighted indiscriminate attacks in civilianpopulated areas that have spread fear and panic among populations and forced people to take refuge in shelters and subways. Children and newborn babies have not been spared in this regrettable situation. Thousands of people have also been internally displaced, including Ghanaians and other nationals, with more than half a million people forced to flee to neighbouring countries as refugees. Ghana calls for an immediate and unconditional cessation of the hostilities that have caused the current humanitarian crisis and urges the parties to refrain from further attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, in accordance with international humanitarian law. We strongly call on the parties to grant unfettered access to humanitarian agencies and guarantee their protection and safety. We also call for the safe passage of all civilians caught up in the war who desire to leave Ukraine. In that regard, Ghana encourages the countries neighbouring Ukraine to facilitate the free passage of persons fleeing the war, without discrimination, and to provide them with humanitarian assistance, including medical care, in line with the principles of humanity, neutrality and impartiality. We continue to urge the parties to accept the path of peace and seek an early resolution through dialogue and diplomacy."," I would like to thank the briefers for their informative presentations. I also want to take this opportunity to express our solidarity with all the families who have lost someone in this war; with all the people left without a home, water or electricity; with those who are fleeing in fear, in some cases with nowhere to go; and with everyone who is now trapped in a conflict zone, desperately attempting to find refuge. I want to commend all the personnel who are now in Ukraine trying to alleviate the people’s suffering. We know that they are doing their best in very challenging circumstances, and we know that more can be done to assist them in their efforts. As we speak, hundreds of thousands of civilians have already fled Ukraine. Many more, perhaps millions, will certainly follow. Most of the hostilities are playing out in densely populated areas where there is an increased risk of civilian casualties, including children, particularly when explosive weapons are used. Civilians are being called on to join the fighting, possibly with no proper training. There is a pressing humanitarian need for medical services, medicines, health equipment, shelter and protection. Brazil calls on all the parties to fully respect international humanitarian law and uphold the principles of distinction, proportionality, precaution, necessity and humanity at all times. It is vital that we ensure the protection of civilians, critical civilian infrastructure, refugees and displaced persons, as well as unhindered humanitarian access to all in need. We also reiterate our appeal to Ukraine and Russia to facilitate the evacuation of all persons who want to leave the territory of Ukraine. Brazil expresses its gratitude to Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Moldova, Romania and others that are facilitating the exit of people fleeing the conflict, including Brazilians and Latin Americans. In international humanitarian law, it does not matter how a war came to be or who was responsible for it. What matters is sparing civilians and maintaining a minimum of humanity in an already inhumane situation. We therefore can and must come together, beyond any discussions in the Security Council on the reasons for the war, in order to adopt measures to minimize the humanitarian impact of the conflict. That is the minimum that we can do. In moving forward, it will be important to closely monitor the situation on the ground, the number of civilian casualties and the immediate needs of the population. At the same time, there is no doubt that the best way to protect civilians and prevent a humanitarian crisis is to prevent conflict and cease it as soon as it erupts. Any war will generate devastation, death, chaos and fear. The greater the escalation, the higher the risks of human suffering. In the past few days, permanent members of the Council, who bear the greatest responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, have been openly referring to severe unilateral sanctions, military action and nuclear forces. That must stop. The world needs that escalation to stop and dialogue to resume. The severe economic sanctions being imposed may have ripple effects on the world’s economy with consequences felt far beyond Russia. Populations in developing countries may be the ones who suffer the most. Supplying arms to the region and promoting its militarization will hardly promote dialogue and will probably provoke more tensions. Since we have seen reports of nuclear forces being put on high alert, I would like to remind the Council that the International Court of Justice has stated that nuclear weapons have the potential to destroy all civilization and the entire ecosystem of the planet, and that their use or threat of use would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict. Any use of nuclear weapons would have unacceptable humanitarian consequences for current and future generations in the territory of Ukraine and beyond. So far we have received reports of approximately 200 to 300 civilian casualties in Ukraine, which is already devastating. How many deaths would there be if a party were to resort to the use of a weapon of mass destruction? What would be the extent of that destruction? We have seen it before, and we hope — we plead with everyone involved — that we will not see it again.","I thank Mr. Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, and Mr. Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, for their briefings. I also welcome the participation today of the representative of Ukraine. The humanitarian suffering in Ukraine is unnecessary and uncalled-for. Kenya offers its condolences to the families who have lost loved ones to the conflict in the last few days. We regret the mounting casualties, the hundreds of thousands internally displaced and those who are leaving Ukraine as refugees, as well as the growing damage to civilian objects and infrastructure. We commend the United Nations for swiftly stepping in to provide humanitarian assistance. We also commend Ukraine’s neighbours for opening their borders to refugees. We give special thanks to Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia for working with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ensure that Kenyan citizens in Ukraine are granted visafree entry. In the unfolding emergency there have been disturbing reports about racist treatment of Africans, and people of African descent, seeking to flee Ukraine to safety. The media is covering those appalling incidents, and several States have confirmed that their citizens have suffered such treatment. We strongly condemn that racism and believe it is damaging to the spirit of solidarity that is so urgently needed today. The mistreatment of African peoples on Europe’s borders needs to cease immediately, whether it is directed at Africans fleeing Ukraine or crossing the Mediterranean. And we also need to understand that there are actors who want to magnify this story for cynical reasons that have nothing to do with the wellbeing and safety of Africans. We are here to discuss the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. But if we are truly to hold to humanitarian principles, we must broaden our view. The extensive unilateral economic sanctions that have been announced against the Russian Federation are almost certain to have serious humanitarian consequences. In total, their effects may even amount to a form of blockade. It is our contention that the peaceful means for settling conflicts advocated by the Charter of the United Nations do not include acts that may constitute collective punishment. We must also add caution that such considerable sanctions, rather than opening the path to peace, may lead to an escalation and broadening of the conflict. The only way out of this increasingly dangerous crisis is to prioritize diplomacy in order to limit all military manoeuvres and open a path to negotiations. It is still not too late to turn to the good offices of the SecretaryGeneral, regional organizations and bilateral efforts to de-escalate this dangerous crisis. Whether the conflict ends now or later, with even more disastrous results, it will still require an appetite for negotiating a stable security order. At this moment, statesmanship is required, and we urge all leaders of the States involved to embrace their responsibility. In conclusion, I reiterate Kenya’s recognition of the inviolable rights of Ukraine to its sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence.","I would like to thank Mr. Martin Griffiths and Mr. Filippo Grandi for their briefings. The humanitarian situation in Ukraine has deteriorated significantly in recent days, with the continued fighting resulting in damage to the country’s infrastructure as well as civilian casualties and deaths. According to United Nations reports, hundreds of thousands of people are suffering owing the lack of essential services. Many homes have been damaged or destroyed and hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced or are seeking refuge in neighbouring countries. All civilians seeking refuge should be able to do so unimpeded and without being discriminated against. In the light of the crisis in Ukraine, we stress the importance of focusing on the deteriorating humanitarian situation for civilians, including by working to ensure their protection and prevent the disastrous humanitarian situation from escalating beyond our ability to address or contain it. For its part, the United Arab Emirates is addressing the humanitarian needs resulting from the crisis in Ukraine with continuing efforts to alleviate the suffering of civilians affected by the conflict. We deplore the ongoing violence in Ukraine and reiterate the need for self-restraint, a ceasefire and a peaceful resolution. If the hostilities continue, more innocent people will lose their lives and the humanitarian situation, which has been exacerbated by extreme cold temperatures this winter, will worsen further, at a time when civilians are fleeing the crisis and seeking refuge and safe havens. We therefore urge all the parties to fulfil their obligations under international law, including by allowing humanitarian aid to reach those in need and refraining from targeting civilians. We also reiterate the importance of complying with the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, especially that of respect for the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of States. Those principles, on which the United Nations was founded, apply to all Member States, regardless of their resources, capabilities or physical size. In conclusion, my country emphasizes once again the importance of working to reach an immediate ceasefire and seeking peaceful solutions that serve regional and international security and stability."," I thank Under-Secretary-General Martin Griffiths and High Commissioner Filippo Grandi for their insightful briefings. I also welcome the participation of the Permanent Representative of Ukraine in these discussions. Our view of the situation in Ukraine is clear. We do not want a war against a Member State of the United Nations, and we equally deplore the humanitarian consequences of war. My country is deeply concerned about the attacks on civilians and civilian public goods. We urge the parties to the conflict to refrain from any use of weapons that may have indiscriminate effects. We stand in solidarity with the people who are victims of a war not of their choosing and one that they did not provoke. For that reason, we call for the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to those who need it, without discrimination. We commend in that regard the outpouring of generosity that Ukraine’s neighbours have shown in welcoming those fleeing the war. I want to echo the cries for help from the African nationals and students, including students from my country, who are facing discrimination as they flee the war in Ukraine and seek shelter. There have been many accounts of people experiencing racism, which is unacceptable. We urge respect for people’s dignity and call for all persons in distress to be treated equitably. Gabon would like to take this opportunity to emphasize the African Union’s call under these circumstances for respect for international law and for the equal treatment of all persons crossing international borders during the conflict. The only way to end humanitarian suffering and the people’s distress is by ending the hostilities. We therefore reiterate our call for an immediate ceasefire and de-escalation. The scale of the needs in Ukraine and its neighbouring countries requires a commensurate humanitarian response. The funding appeal for humanitarian assistance to be launched tomorrow by the Secretary-General will give us an excellent opportunity to achieve that. In conclusion, my country urges the international community to demonstrate empathy and to provide support to all the victims of the war, without discrimination based on nationality or race.","First of all, I would like to thank the Security Council for addressing this urgent issue. With every new day, the unprovoked Russian war against Ukraine increases the human suffering across the entire country. I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to the Secretary-General for his powerful statement and relentless engagement with the situation in my country. The Ukrainian Government welcomes the appointment of Mr. Amin Awad as Assistant SecretaryGeneral to serve as United Nations Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine, and I know he has arrived in Geneva and assumed his duties. His mission will be extremely difficult against the backdrop of the ongoing Russian military activities, which are often equal to war crimes. At the same time, millions of Ukrainians will require his attention, in particular our children, women, older persons and other vulnerable citizens. I wish him and his team strength and mercy in their work. Let us be clear: this is not only a security crisis. This is a humanitarian crisis. This war of choice is not only a violation of international law, but it violates the conscience of the world. Security assistance is needed, but it alone is not enough. We call on international organizations to provide us with humanitarian assistance. We call on the international community to register all cases in which international law and international humanitarian law are violated. Almost all speakers and briefers today were unanimous in their assessments: the situation in Ukraine could deteriorate sharply. Let me provide the Security Council with the latest available information from the Government of Ukraine. Today is the fifth day of a full-scale, unprovoked and unjustified war launched by Russia against Ukraine — launched by Russia against the very heart of Europe, launched by Russia against the idea and the ideals of democracy. It is the most horrible and large-scale invasion since the Second World War. This morning (see A/ES-11/PV.1), I told the General Assembly about the shelling of the residential city of Kharkiv by Russian Grad rockets, which killed and wounded dozens of innocent civilians. The residents of Kyiv — home to 3 million innocent people — and its suburbs are sitting in Russian crosshairs right now. According to Ukrainian Health Minister Viktor Lyashko, as of today more than 352 people, including 16 children, have been killed, and approximately 2,040 people, including 45 children, have been wounded. Russia continues attacking kindergartens and orphanages. Russia is attacking hospitals. Russia is attacking mobile medical aid brigades with shellfire and sabotage groups. Russia fired on ambulance crews near Zaporizhia and Kyiv. Let me say that again so that everyone can see those images in their minds: Russia is attacking hospitals, mobile aid brigades and ambulances. This is not the action of a State with a legitimate security concern; this is the action of a State determined to kill civilians. There is no debate. These are war crimes. These attacks violate the Rome Statute, and they are far from over. It is why I say that this is a humanitarian crisis. As we sit here, Russian missiles are aimed at destroying critical infrastructure, which could lead to a serious environmental disaster and even radioactive contamination. International humanitarian law is crystal clear: none of those facilities are legitimate military targets. The civilian population of Ukraine is the first to suffer from such attacks, and, if we do not act today, it will be far from the last. We welcomed the statement issued today by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Mr. Karim Khan, on the situation In Ukraine and his decision to proceed with opening an investigation. In his statement, the ICC Prosecutor said: “I have reviewed the Office’s conclusions arising from the preliminary examination of the situation in Ukraine and have confirmed that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with opening an investigation. In particular, I am satisfied that there is a reasonable basis to believe that both alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed in Ukraine in relation to the events already assessed during the preliminary examination by the Office. Given the expansion of the conflict in recent days, it is my intention that this investigation will also encompass any new alleged crimes falling within the jurisdiction of my Office that are committed by any party to the conflict on any part of the territory of Ukraine; “I will also be asking for the support of all States parties, and the international community as a whole, as my Office sets about its investigations. I will be calling for additional budgetary support, for voluntary contributions to support all our situations and for the loan of gratis personnel. The importance and urgency of our mission is too serious to be held hostage to lack of means.” I would say to my colleagues from around the world that this affects them too. Russian military aggression affects not only Ukrainians, but also threatens thousands of foreigners who remain in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Government is doing its best to facilitate their passage at the State border, even as the border has become overwhelmed with the massive influx of people fleeing Russia’s armed aggression. Temporary volunteer assistance points have been set up at the border to provide foreign students with food and other humanitarian needs. Please do not be misled by Russian disinformation: there is no discrimination based on race or nationality, and, if there are cases, they should be investigated. Journalists working in the free press are also under fire during live reports from the scenes of action and hotspots. A journalist and a photographer working for the Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet were injured when their car was targeted in the district of Okhtyrka of the Sumy region. Ukrainian children are crossing the EU-Ukraine border without their parents and without power of attorney from their parents. In that regard, we request decision-makers in the EU countries to provide clarifications and instructions to EU institutions in order to secure the free movement of, and assistance to, such underage persons and their guardians. According to the Ministry of Education of Ukraine, more than 350,000 school children have no access to education. Schools are closed, owing to severe insecurity in several areas across the country. The number of refugees is being assessed. It could be hundreds of thousands of people who have been forced to flee across international borders into neighbouring European countries, mostly Poland, Slovakia and Romania. It can take several days of waiting to cross the border, and we are grateful that more checkpoints on the border with Poland have been opened, including two additional pedestrian crossings for all who want to get from Ukraine to the neighbouring safe country. Key local authorities have set up a coordinating humanitarian headquarters to provide food and basic necessities to those in need. An electronic platform will be launched tomorrow. On the platform, businesses will be able to provide information about available resources, and Kyiv residents will be able to make their needs known. All of the information will systematize the quick and effective communication and distribution of essential goods. Olga Stefanishyna, the Vice-Prime Minister of Ukraine, who has been appointed as the Government coordinator for humanitarian assistance, is working 24/7. There are many urgent things to do, such as agreeing on humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from the most endangered territories. However, I need to warn the Council not to be misled by Russian assurances of security. Russian words often, if not always, do not match their deeds. For instance, just recently, we heard Russian politicians and diplomats, even here in this Chamber, say that there would be no invasion of, or attacks against, Ukraine. Therefore, those corridors can be easy targets for the Russian army. The Vice-Prime Minister is working to help people at the border crossing-points in the western regions of Ukraine who have been waiting to cross for at least one to two days, provide assistance to internally displaced persons in those areas, including housing, schools and jobs, and to provide humanitarian aid to civilians who have remained in their homes and are now cut off from markets, including in the occupied territories. This is not only a security crisis. This is a humanitarian crisis, as I said earlier. The Russian war against Ukraine has brought the entire region to the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe. Let me therefore repeat our call to international organizations to provide every possible form of humanitarian assistance and record all cases in which international law and international humanitarian law are violated. Council members have all heard the lies from the Russian side, the lies in Moscow, the lies in the General Assembly and the lies in the Security Council. Do not listen to Russian lies. Listen to Ukraine’s cries. Listen to the cries of men, women and children who have lived in peace, who deserve to remain in peace and who support — and will forever support — Council members’ own nations’ efforts for peace, across Europe and around the world. Russia has tried, and failed, to defend its lies. But the people of Ukraine, with the help of the world, will never fail to defend our land. Do not listen to Russia’s lies. Listen to Ukrainian cries. We need the Council’s help. The Russian Ambassador laments the fact that a dozen Russian spies will no longer be able to enjoy all the benefits of American life while conducting activities that are incompatible with their status, which is used as a cover. The Russian Ambassador should instead work hard to report to his superiors on his cronies — a bunch of cronies — in line with his narrative here at the United Nations. I would like to conclude by saying that I look forward to midnight, although midnight is the most dangerous time right now, as that is when the majority of attacks take place. However, I look forward to midnight when this abomination of an occupation of the seat of the President of the Council will come to an end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S/PV.8980,27/02/2022,"Russian aggression against Ukraine (24 February Invasion, continued), Resolution on calling an emergency session of the General Assembly","We are currently witnessing dramatic changes in the situation in Ukraine. China has on many occasions made its position clear on the issue of Ukraine, and it remains unchanged. We believe that the top priority now is for all parties to exercise the necessary restraint to prevent the situation in Ukraine from deteriorating. China supports and encourages all diplomatic efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of the Ukraine crisis and welcomes direct dialogue and negotiations between Russia and Ukraine as soon as possible. At the same time, China supports discussions on an equal footing between the European Union and Russia on European security issues and upholding the principle of indivisible security to eventually establish a balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism. China believes that the Security Council should give priority to regional peace and stability and the universal security of all countries, and play a constructive role in resolving the Ukraine issue. Actions taken by the United Nations should help calm the situation and facilitate diplomatic solutions to avoid an escalation of tensions. ","On Friday (see S/PV.8979), the Russian Federation was alone in the Council in blocking the adoption of draft resolution S/2022/155, co-sponsored by 82 United Nations Member States. It called for an end to the aggression against Ukraine. France does not accept such obstruction. It therefore voted today in favour of resolution 2623 (2022), which calls for convening an emergency special session of the General Assembly. The matter remains before the Security Council. France will remain poised within the Council to ensure that it assumes its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. In this context, the President of the French Republic, Emmanuel Macron, would like the Security Council to meet as soon as tomorrow on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. Together with Mexico, France will submit a draft resolution to guarantee unhindered humanitarian access to meet the urgent needs of the people remaining in Ukraine. In response to those who attempt to impose the law of the strongest, the international community must demonstrate its unity, solidarity and adhesion to the rule of law. France stands firmly by Ukraine and its people. ","In accordance with rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite the representative of Ukraine to participate in this meeting. The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. Members of the Council have before them document S/2022/160, which contains the text of a draft resolution submitted by Albania and the United States of America. The Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now. The draft resolution received 11 votes in favour, 1 against and 3 abstentions. The draft resolution has been adopted as resolution 2623 (2022). I now give the floor to those members of the Council who wish to make statements after the voting. I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the Russian Federation. Russia voted against resolution 2623 (2022) because its authors proposed that it be placed on record that the Security Council is unable to uphold its primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. There is no hint in the text of any attempt to find a constructive solution in the Council. Two days ago (see S/PV.8979), we vetoed another draft resolution (S/2022/155) for the same reason — it was one-sided and unbalanced. There are no new initiatives either. The United Nations and the Security Council were created in a post-war period to save succeeding generations from the scourge of a new war. To that end, global Powers decided to negotiate among themselves, ideally to achieve consensus. In any event, the objective was never to attempt to impose decisions on each other or to disregard the interests of any of the five permanent members. That is precisely why the Security Council grants its permanent members the right to veto decisions. It is not a privilege but a tool for ensuring the balance of interests, which is of paramount importance to the entire world. The balance of interests ensures global stability. Any attempt to circumvent or disregard the position of the Russian Federation undermines the bedrock of the Charter of the United Nations. What we need is not to ram through such schemes, but instead attempt to find common ground, regardless of the attempts of our Western partners to avoid that, including when they disregard our legitimate concerns about NATO policy and violations by Western States of the core principles of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on the principle of the indivisibility of security. We now need to focus on resolving the situation that led to the current crisis. It did not start when Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine. It started much earlier, when for eight years the Council turned a blind eye to crimes perpetrated by Ukrainian nationalists in Donbas. Today once again, no mention was made of the suffering of the people of Donbas. The images of homes in Donbas that were destroyed by nationalists and Ukraine’s armed forces have been brazenly presented by Western media outlets as a consequence of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine. At today’s meeting, we are once again hearing lies and false information about the indiscriminate bombing of Ukrainian cities, hospitals and schools. The Russian military poses no threat to Ukraine’s peaceful citizens. The military does not fire at peaceful civilian infrastructure. However, Ukrainian nationalists pose a threat as they hold the people of Ukraine hostage and use them as human shields. There is ample evidence from ordinary Ukrainians proving that, despite public protests, nationalists are deploying heavy equipment and multiple rocket launchers in residential areas. That is an egregious violation of international humanitarian law that needs to be duly condemned. Essentially, those are the same tactics being used by Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant terrorists. All responsibility for the potential repercussions lies in the hands of the Maidan regime. The residents of Ukraine are also under threat from the ongoing activities of radicals, who are giving power to all those who want it, including prisoners escaped from jail, and giving weapons to marauders, thieves and criminals. There has been sufficient evidence of that on social networks from the residents of Kyiv and other cities, demonstrating the reckless attitude of the Ukrainian authorities towards their own citizens. An information war has now been unleashed against the Russian Federation on social networks. Insofar as evidence of the destruction of civilian infrastructure by the Russian military does not exist, Ukrainian strikes and accidental strikes and videos from Donbas are being portrayed as such, whereas they are actually being carried out by Ukrainian nationalists. Furthermore, social networks have a host of educational manuals on how to create fakes to depict Russian military operations and other fabrications. There are 1.2 million such fakes currently circulating on social networks. We urge our colleagues not to aid and abet the proliferation of such disinformation, although I fear that, once again, our call will fall upon deaf ears. I resume my functions as President of the Council. I now give the floor to the representative of Ukraine. ","The United Kingdom welcomes the result of the voting on resolution 2623 (2022) today. By voting in favour of convening an emergency special session of the General Assembly on Ukraine tomorrow, the members of the Security Council have laid bare Russia’s diplomatic impotence. Russia again was isolated in opposing the resolution, but Russia cannot stop the world from coming together to condemn its invasion of Ukraine. As each day passes in this unprovoked and unjustified war, support for the people of Ukraine, their plight and their fight for freedom grows. We therefore urge all Members of the United Nations to use their voice tomorrow to call for the immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine and end this war. ","On Friday night, we stood together outside this Chamber to declare that the Russian veto (see S/PV.8979) would not stop us from holding Russia accountable for invading a sovereign State — a State that dared to be a democracy. Russia vetoed Friday’s draft resolution (S/2022/155) but, as I have said before, Russia cannot veto our voices, Russia cannot veto the Ukrainian people, and Russia cannot veto the Charter of the United Nations. Russia cannot and will not veto accountability. Now, the Security Council has taken an important step forward towards that accountability. For the first time in decades, it has called for an emergency special session of the General Assembly. The Council members who supported resolution 2623 (2022) recognize that this is no ordinary moment. We need to take extraordinary actions to meet this threat to our international system and do everything we can to help Ukraine and its people. Just this morning, President Putin put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert, although he is invading a country with no nuclear weapons and is under no threat from NATO, a defensive alliance that will not fight in Ukraine. This is another escalatory and unnecessary step that threatens us all. We urge Russia to tone down its dangerous rhetoric with regard to nuclear weapons. These are issues that affect all Member States, and now in the General Assembly they can all make their voices heard on Russia’s war of choice. We will then vote on a draft resolution that will hold Russia to account for its indefensible actions and for its violations of the Charter. As we speak, rockets continue to rain down on Kyiv and across Ukraine. Tanks are tearing through cities. Russia continues to ready even more brutal weaponry — bombs that flatten cities and indiscriminately target civilians — for an unjustifiable assault, fabricated out of lies and the rewriting of history. Russia also propagates outrageous lies about Ukraine’s conduct in its own defence. We are alarmed by the mounting reports of civilian casualties, videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine and the widespread destruction of civilian facilities like residences, schools and hospitals. To the Russian officers and soldiers, I say that the world is watching, photographic and video evidence is mounting, and they will be held to account for their actions. We will not let atrocities slide. Those of us here safely sitting in this hallowed Chamber have a moral responsibility to respond to Russia’s desecration of human life. That means humanitarian aid like the thermal blankets that the United States Agency for International Development has already airlifted to tens of thousands of Ukrainians in need and the recently announced $54 million in additional humanitarian assistance that will reach hundreds of thousands more. That means military support, including the additional $350 million of security assistance that the United States is shipping to Ukraine. And it means holding the sole aggressor — Russia — accountable for its actions. That will take some courage from some fellow Member States, and I know that. For inspiration, I would ask them to look to the Ukrainian people. They have shown strength, courage and resilience in the face of Russian guns, soldiers, bombs and rockets. They also maintain the courage to sit down and talk. We welcome their continued willingness to participate in peace talks. On Friday night, darkness descended on Kyiv. Missiles attacked a sheltering city. But the next morning, Ukrainians woke up to a new citizen — a baby girl born to a mother in a bomb shelter. The baby’s name is Mia. Photos of her tiny hand gripping her mother as they hid underground have inspired the world. Let us have the courage of Mia’s mother. Let us have the courage of the Ukrainian people standing bravely to defend their democracy, way of life and futures. Let us show them that they are not alone; that the world stands behind them; that the United Nations has a purpose; and that the additional bravery of the protesters in Russia is not in vain. Let us do everything we can to help the people of Ukraine as they stand up for themselves, their sovereign country and their children. ","Albania voted in favour and welcomes the adoption of resolution 2623 (2022). Formally, this short text is of a purely procedural nature, but its significance is of historic proportions. Last Friday (see S/PV.8979), a veto tried to lock the United Nations at a time when we need it most. That is no longer the case. The five lines of the text we have just adopted open the big doors of the place where the world meets — the General Assembly — to speak out and condemn an unprovoked and unjustified pure act of aggression.The General Assembly emergency session is all about condemning an unprovoked war. It is all about upholding the Charter of the United Nations. It is about sending a clear and iron-clad message of what is acceptable and what is not, including to the Russians citizens who need to listen to the world and hear it. Russia must be stopped in its attempt to break the international rules-based order and replace it with its will.All Member States, especially the small ones like mine, which constitute the majority of United Nations Members, must remember that international law, rules and the Charter are their best friend, their best army, their best defence and their best insurance. Russia’s actions undermine them. It is time to learn from past mistakes, not repeat and perpetuate them.Russia can at any moment come back to reason, stop the war, recall its invading troops and return to talks — but they must be genuine talks for peace, not for surrender or capitulation. But that requires lucidity, courage and wisdom, not threats of an apocalypse. As we said last Friday, this is no time to remain idle or look away. It is time to stand up. Ukraine and Ukrainians are resisting. We are and will stand with Ukraine.","Ireland once again strongly condemns the Russian Federation’s further invasion of Ukraine, a sovereign and independent country. Since we last met on Friday (see S/PV.8979), the Russian Federation has intensified its unjustified and unprovoked attack against Ukraine. Russia’s aggression is causing mounting hardship and suffering for the people of Ukraine, who have shown remarkable resilience and resolve. Ireland stands in full solidarity with them today.The Security Council has a responsibility to act in the face of conflict and respond to this grave threat to international peace and security. We have failed to exercise that responsibility. We were rendered powerless to do so, despite the clear will of 11 members of the Council, by the Russian Federation’s use of the veto in a flagrant attempt to excuse its own military aggression against Ukraine — a fellow Member of our United Nations. The use of the anachronistic veto in such terrible and tragic circumstances is reprehensible and undermines the legitimacy of the Council in the eyes of the watching world.However, the veto will not prevent the international community from responding to Russia’s blatant breaches of international law, nor will it deter us from holding Russia accountable for its actions. Ireland voted in favour of resolution 2623 (2022) to convene an emergency special session of the General Assembly. Ireland calls on our fellow members of the General Assembly to step up where the Council has failed, to uphold the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, to condemn aggression and to support a return to the path of diplomacy and peace. That is the very least that the people of Ukraine deserve from us in their hour of need. We cannot let them down.","Norway voted in favour of resolution 2623 (2022).Just two days ago, in this Chamber (see S/PV.8979), we all saw that Russia was isolated and had no support for its attack on Ukraine. Russia’s action is unacceptable. Russia is wrong. Russia is the aggressor that violates the very core principles of international law that the United Nations stands for.On Friday, the Security Council failed to uphold its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. The Council’s response to the breach of the peace and the act of aggression failed because of the veto by the aggressor itself. Preventing such acts is a direct responsibility of the Security Council. Therefore, it was necessary to reconvene today to decide to call an emergency special session of the General Assembly on this issue.Now, we will take this matter to the General Assembly for the purpose of making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures. Russia will be held accountable.The civilian population, including children, is suffering the consequences of this horrifying conflict: killings, displacement and disappearances; fighting in and around urban areas; the use of heavy explosive weapons; and the destruction of civilian infrastructure. We remain deeply concerned about the protracted harm to the civilian population.Norway is on the side of the Ukrainian people and its Government. We are providing further assistance to Ukraine. The Norwegian Government has today decided to provide $226 million in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.Let me conclude by reiterating that Norway insists that the Russian Federation immediately, completely and unconditionally stop all fighting and withdraw all its forces from the territory of Ukraine.","It is regrettable that the situation in Ukraine has worsened further since the Security Council last convened on this matter (see S/PV.8979). We reiterate our call for an immediate cessation of violence and an end to all hostilities. There is no other choice but to return to the path of diplomacy and dialogue.Our Prime Minister has advocated this strongly in his recent conversations with the leadership of the Russian Federation and Ukraine. In this regard, we welcome today’s announcement by both sides that they will hold talks at the Belarus border.The global order is anchored on international law, the Charter of the United Nations and respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all States. We are all agreed on these principles.We continue to be deeply concerned about the safety and security of Indian nationals, including a large number of Indian students who are still stranded in Ukraine. Our evacuation efforts have been adversely impacted by the complex and uncertain situation at the border crossings. It is important to maintain an uninterrupted and predictable movement of people. It is an urgent humanitarian necessity that must be immediately addressed.Taking into consideration the totality of circumstances, we decided to abstain.","On Friday, 25 February (see S/PV.8979), as a result of the exercise of the veto, the Security Council was unable to fulfil its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, as it was unable to adopt draft resolution S/2022/155, on the situation in Ukraine, despite the fact that 11 members voted in favour of it.In response to the paralysis of the Security Council, today we have invoked General Assembly resolution 377 (V), entitled “Uniting for peace”, to convene an emergency special session of the General Assembly with the urgency that the situation warrants. Since 1945, Mexico has maintained its unwavering position against the exercise of the veto by the permanent members of the Security Council. As we have repeatedly stated and reiterate today, that power should not be a privilege. In every situation, it constitutes an enormous and highly sensitive responsibility. Consequently, Mexico unequivocally supports convening the eleventh emergency special session of the General Assembly. As the Permanent Representative of France noted, we will convene a meeting of the Security Council to consider the overall humanitarian situation on the ground and facilitate the swift delivery of humanitarian aid to those most in need. ","Let me begin by acknowledging the dangerous moments in which we live and noting the necessity for diplomacy to triumph over war. I therefore urge that, even at this difficult moment, and as diplomatic representatives of our States, we maintain the commitment of our States to dialogue and the objectives of peace.Last Friday, because of the exercise of the veto (see S/PV.8979), the Council was unable to assume its primary responsibility to act on a threat to international peace and security following the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine. It is time for the General Assembly to assume its residual responsibility and to pronounce itself on the matter. It is for that reason that Ghana voted in favour of resolution 2623 (2022), just adopted. As we consider the resolution we have just adopted, it is important that we do so with sobriety, not only for this generation, but also for those whose blood and trust speak to us from the restless graves of those who died in the two World Wars.As a condition for becoming a Member of the United Nations, we all declared that we would fulfil our obligations under the Charter of the United Nations in averment of our peace-loving nature. Today, the peace we say we love is threatened. Ghana therefore calls on all Member States to participate in the emergency special session of the General Assembly in a constructive manner and to unite around the call for peace to stop this unjustified war that has already caused the needless loss of many lives.","Last Friday (see S/PV.8979), my delegation laid out before the Security Council a comprehensive view of its concerns regarding the security developments in and around Ukraine. Nothing in the intervening period has allayed those concerns. On the contrary, in fact, as we speak the number of casualties, the human suffering and the risks to international peace and security keep increasing by the hour. Indeed, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recently indicated the number of refugees to already be 422,000.We voted in favour of resolution 2623 (2022) before the Council, despite misgivings about its timing and its contribution to achieving peace. These misgivings arise ultimately from our unyielding commitment to respect for and interest in upholding the Charter of the United Nations and the role of the security Council.The urgency of the situation has convinced us of the need to add the voice of the General Assembly to that of the Security Council in seeking solutions to the crisis in and around Ukraine. This in no way detracts from our firm belief that the Council, with its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, has not yet exhausted the instruments and mechanisms at its disposal to contribute to a negotiated and diplomatic solution towards peace.Therefore, we reiterate our call for an immediate cessation of hostilities, for full respect for humanitarian law and for a renewed attempt within the Security Council to promote and support the process of dialogue between the parties involved — a role that the Council is inherently better equipped to play — to bring a peaceful solution to the Ukrainian conflict. The Security Council and the General Assembly must work together.As we renew our calls for an immediate ceasefire, we also appeal to Ukraine and Russia to facilitate the withdrawal of all persons who want to leave the Ukrainian territory. Brazil already wishes to express its gratitude to Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Moldova, Romania and others that are facilitating the exit of people fleeing the conflict, in particular Brazilians and Latin Americans.Let us be exceedingly cautious in moving forward in the General Assembly. The supply of weapons, the recourse to cyberattacks and the application of selective sanctions, which could affect sectors such as fertilizers and wheat, with a strong risk of famine, entail the risk of exacerbating the conflict and not of resolving it. We cannot be oblivious to the fact that these measures enhance the risks of wider and direct confrontation between NATO and Russia. It is our duty, both in the Security Council and the General Assembly, to stop and reverse this escalation. We need to engage in serious negotiations, in good faith, that could allow the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, security guarantees for Ukraine and Russia, and strategic stability in Europe.",Did not speak.,"The United Arab Emirates regrets the fact that the situation in Ukraine has worsened since our last meeting (see S/PV.8979) and reiterates its call for a cessation of hostilities. We remain steadfast in our belief that dialogue and diplomacy should be the only path to resolving differences. We therefore welcome today’s news that talks may commence tomorrow morning on the Ukraine-Belarus border. That is urgent and much needed.We will work tirelessly to support efforts towards a peaceful resolution. As we conveyed on Friday, the developments in Ukraine undermine regional and international peace and security. The United Arab Emirates reiterates that the protection of civilians in Ukraine is of the utmost importance, particularly as the security situation escalates. Civilians trying to reach safety must be able to leave unhindered. It is of paramount importance that the necessary humanitarian aid be delivered to those in need. Space for humanitarian assistance must be preserved so that humanitarian actors can maintain access to civilians.We emphasize the importance of upholding international humanitarian law and mitigating the impact of the conflict on the most vulnerable. We reiterate once again the absolute need to uphold the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, in particular respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all Member States.","The Council meets today, Sunday, in an attempt to echo the unequivocal messages of the international community against the war in Ukraine. As we stated in the Council just two days ago (see S/PV.8979), we reiterate our ongoing commitment to the founding principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which must be respected by each of its Member States. We also have faith in international solidarity and multilateralism.It is those values that give our Charter and Organization their full relevance and integrity, and the reason we voted in favour of holding an emergency special session of the General Assembly on Ukraine. Today, our thoughts are with the innocent people suffering the horrors of a war that they neither chose nor provoked and the thousands of civilians fleeing their homes, towns and country to seek refuge elsewhere.My country is deeply concerned about the attacks on civilians and civilian public goods and calls for de-escalation. We call on the parties to the conflict to refrain from any use or threat of use of weapons that may have indiscriminate effects.Lastly, Gabon continues to call for an immediate ceasefire and the resumption of open sincere dialogue. There is still time — there is always time — to choose dialogue and diplomacy over force.","I would like to express my gratitude to those Council members that have supported the request to call for an emergency special session of the General Assembly.I immediately express my regret that, once again, rule 20 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure has not been properly applied by the presidency. However, I express my relief that this rape of the institution of the presidency of the Security Council will be over in less than 48 hours.To those who appear to see no reason to support the request to hold the emergency session — despite the letter I sent to all members yesterday — as well as the representative of the aggressor, I would like to address the following.Do they know what the most common warning is now in most Ukrainian cities? “Attention: air raids. Please proceed to the shelters.” I recommend that they look at the pictures and footage of what is happening, day after day, night after night.I will continue to invite all members of the Security Council to join in the catharsis — the purgation — of this institution that will save it for the next generation.Russia persists in its aggression, despite the initial plan for a blitzkrieg, which has failed. We can all see that. That failure prompted the bloody and mad Russian leadership to order the heavy shelling of residential areas, critical infrastructure and hazardous material storage sites in retaliation for Ukrainian resilience and resistance. It is extremely alarming that, today, the Russian President has resorted to open nuclear blackmail. The world must take that threat very seriously.Now, most instances of fighting are occurring around the Ukrainian capital, as well as in the north-east in the cities of Kharkiv, Sumy and Chernihiv and in the southern cities of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Mariupol. Long-range operational and tactical aircraft, high-precision long-range weapons and multiple rocket launcher systems are being widely used against the Ukrainians.Among the most telling recent examples of the Russian course of action in Ukraine was a missile strike on the town of Vasylkiv, which is practically a suburb of the capital. A missile hit the oil depot, causing a large-scale fire. There was also shelling in Kharkiv that damaged the gas pipeline.According to the Ukrainian Minister for Health, Mr. Viktor Lyashko, at least 16 children have been killed since 24 February, when the large-scale military aggression against Ukraine was launched. On 26 February, a 7-year-old girl died after having been seriously wounded during the shelling of a kindergarten in the city of Okhtyrka. On the same day, due to the shelling and gunshots, a child was killed and two more wounded at the Okhmadet Children’s Hospital, in Kyiv. Due to the threat of air raids, maternity hospitals in a number of Ukrainian cities — including Kiev, Kharkiv, Sumy, Irpin and Bucha, to name just a few — cannot operate normally. Ukrainian children are being born in bomb shelters.According to the Ministry of Education of Ukraine, as of now more than 350,000 schoolchildren have no access to education. Thirty-three schools with over 5,500 students are closed due to severe insecurity in civil areas.Today, I have brought those appalling facts to the attention of UNICEF, asking it to respond immediately to the situation, give proper qualification to the actions of the Russian Federation and take all possible measures to prevent further deaths and violence against children in Ukraine due to the blatant Russian aggression. I sent them via diplomatic note and I look forward to working with UNICEF on the issue.The losses of the enemy as early as 27 February have amounted to nearly 4,300 personnel killed and over 200 taken as prisoners of war. That detailed information has been posted by the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.As always, Russia denies that its soldiers have been taken prisoner and does not acknowledged all the soldiers who have been killed. In that regard, Ukraine has opened a hotline entitled “Come Back Alive from Ukraine” for the relatives of Russian soldiers who are not aware of their whereabouts and cannot contact them. The hotline was opened by the Government of Ukraine and received over 100 calls from Russian mothers during its first hour of operation.It is unfortunate, however, that today, pursuant to the decision of the Prosecutor-General of the Russian Federation, the hotline and its dedicated website have been shut down. I therefore want to take this opportunity to read out the telephone number for anyone in Russia who would like to call regarding soldiers who may have been killed or taken prisoner in Ukraine and enquire about their well-being. The number is (380) 894201860. We will distribute that information after the meeting. I hope that the Russian Government does not shut down the website of the United Nations now that I have read that number.We condemn the fact that Belarus is deeply engaged in the armed aggression against Ukraine. Since the beginning of the Russian aggression, Belarus has provided its territory for the Russian offensive. Today, Zhytomyr Airport, in the Ukrainian city of Zhytomyr, was hit by Iskander missiles launched from the territory of Belarus. That is quite an invitation for the negotiations at the border of Belarus — quite a way to escalate and raise stakes by the aggressor on the eve of negotiations.Ukraine has filed a case against the Russian Federation at the International Court of Justice, as well as a request for the Court to issue an order of provisional measures against Russia. We will distribute that information and very soon, if it is not already there, it will be available on the Court’s website. Ukraine seeks an emergency hearing and an order by the Court that Russia must cease its unlawful attack on Ukraine. Russia will have to answer for its behaviour at the world court in The Hague. The Court has jurisdiction to hear Ukraine’s case and to order emergency measures on the basis of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, also known as the Genocide Convention. The Genocide Convention is one of the most important international treaties drafted in response to the horrors of the Second World War and the Holocaust.Russia, however, has twisted the concept of genocide and perverted the solemn treaty obligation to prevent and punish genocide. It has made an absurd and unfounded claim of alleged genocide as a justification and pretext for its own aggression against Ukraine, in violation of the sovereignty and human rights of the Ukrainian people. Ukraine’s case before the International Court of Justice will establish that Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is based on a lie and a gross violation of international law and must be stopped. As the Ukrainian people continue to bravely stand against Russian aggression, Russia’s lies will be exposed and Russia’s contempt for international law will be confirmed. Ukraine will bring Russia to account.(spoke in Russian)In conclusion, I wish to address the Ambassador of the Russian Federation. During a previous meeting, I spoke about children and parents who take pride in, or are ashamed of, theactions taken by their kin. It seemed to me, at that point, that the Russian Ambassador took my words very personally. I am prepared to take back my words if he were to follow the example of his colleague, Oleg Anisimov, the head of the delegation of the Russian Federation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change at the closure of the session. Today, in response to the emotionally charged statement of the Ukrainian delegation — and it is difficult now for us to speak without emotion — he said that “those who see what is taking place can find no justification for the attack against Ukraine.” That statement was made at a closed meeting, but it was confirmed by a number of participants, and subsequently by Mr. Anisimov himself.There are always choices to be made in life. For example, one can remain a human being or one can continue to defend evil. Everyone has a choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S/PV.8979,25/02/2022,Russian aggression against Ukraine (24 February Invasion),"China is deeply concerned about the latest developments of the situation in Ukraine. Now it has come to a place that we did not want to see. China always forms its own position on the basis of the merits of the matter at hand. We believe that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States should be respected and that the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations should be jointly upheld. We have always called on all parties to seek reasonable solutions to address each other’s concerns through peaceful means on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. We welcome and encourage all efforts for a diplomatic solution and we support the Russian Federation and Ukraine in resolving the issue through negotiations. In the past week, the Security Council has held two emergency meetings (see S/PV.8970 and S/PV.8974) and all parties have fully elaborated their positions and concerns on the current situation. At present, faced with the highly complex and sensitive situation, the Security Council should make the necessary response. At the same time, its response should also be undertaken with great caution. All actions should be truly conducive to defusing the crisis rather than adding fuel to the fire. If not handled properly — or if managed only by exerting pressure and imposing sanctions — there could be more casualties, more property loss and a more complicated and chaotic situation, while it could also become more difficult to resolve differences. It may completely shut the door to a peaceful solution and ultimately vast numbers of innocent people would be the victims. We must draw profound lessons from the extremely painful experiences of the past. For those reasons, China abstained in the voting today. I wish to stress that the issue of Ukraine is not something that only emerged today and the current situation did not develop suddenly overnight. It is the result of the interplay of various factors over a long time. China advocates a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept, in the belief that the security of one country cannot come at the cost of undermining the security of other nations, and that regional security cannot be secured through the strengthening or expansion of military blocs. Against the backdrop of five successive rounds of NATO expansion, Russia’s legitimate security aspirations should receive attention and be addressed properly. Ukraine should become a bridge between the East and the West, not an outpost for confrontation between major powers. We strongly call on all parties concerned to exercise maximum restraint, ease tensions and avoid civilian casualties. The final settlement of the Ukraine crisis requires the Cold War mentality to be abandoned and that full attention and respect be paid to the legitimate security concerns of all countries, as well as that negotiations be held to build a balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism. We urge all parties to return immediately to the track of diplomatic negotiations and political settlement; show sincerity and goodwill; reach a political decision; and engage in dialogue and consultation for a comprehensive settlement of the Ukraine issue. ","At this moment, Russian missiles are killing civilians, bombing cities and destroying essential infrastructure with the sole goal of making Ukraine a vassal State. It is the dreams of reconquering the Russian empire that we have before us. Ukraine is the victim of a premeditated attack by the President of the Russian Federation. Nothing could ever justify that. No member of the Security Council supports it. The result of today’s voting is clear: Russia is alone. France welcomes the mobilization of all members of the Council who by voting in favour of the draft resolution have expressed their commitment to international law and their support for Ukraine. It condemns Russia’s veto of the efforts to restore peace and international order. Russia flouts the responsibilities conferred on it as a permanent member of the Security Council. It uses the Charter of the United Nations to violate the Organization’s most basic principles. At the United Nations and in all forums, France will continue to mobilize with its partners to support Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. ","In accordance with rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite the representatives of Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, Gambia, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Haiti, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kiribati, Kuwait, Latvia, Lesotho, Liberia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, New Zealand, the Niger, North Macedonia, Palau, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Samoa, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, Timor-Leste, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey and Ukraine to participate in this meeting. The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. Members of the Council have before them document S/2022/155, which contains the text of a draft resolution submitted by Albania, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, France, Gambia, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Haiti, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kiribati, Kuwait, Latvia, Lesotho, Liberia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, New Zealand, the Niger, North Macedonia, Norway, Palau, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Samoa, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, Timor-Leste, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United States of America. The Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. I shall now give the floor to those members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.photographs of American aviation bombing Libya. There are photographs from Syria. There are even photographs of the explosion in Beirut that is being presented as something that took place in Ukraine. I will send that article to Council members separately. I wish to turn to my French, British and American colleagues. The Permanent Representative of France said that civilians are being murdered in Ukraine. That is untrue. Russian troops are not bombing Ukrainian cities, and we have said that civilians are not threatened by anything. There is no verifiable confirmation whatsoever about the deaths of civilians. I note that the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom alleged that a Russian military weapon system was targeting civilians. I saw the reports today, and I would like to inform that representative that, as we can see from the videos, that is a heavy surface-to-air missile system system called Strela-10 or Arrow-10. It is in the possession of the Ukrainian armed forces. The Russian military does not have that kind of equipment. It is obsolete. That is the kind of fake information being used by the representative of the United Kingdom. Turning to our colleagues from the United States, I note that with respect to the alleged bombing of the kindergarten, that too is fake information. Of course, it is difficult for us to compete with the United States in terms of the number of invasions targeting their neighbours. I will refrain from listing the aggressions carried out by the United States in its history, but that country is in no position to moralize. I wish to conclude by emphasizing that we are not waging a war against Ukraine or the Ukrainian people. We are carrying out a special operation against nationalists to protect the residents of Donbas and for the purposes of denazification and demilitarization. Those objectives will soon be achieved and the Ukrainian people will gain an opportunity to once again independently determine their future and in so doing live in peace, good neighbourliness and cooperation with all their neighbours. I now resume my functions as the President of the Council. The representative of the United States of America has asked to make a further statement. I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the Russian Federation. The Russian Federation voted against the anti-Russian and anti-Ukrainian draft resolution (S/2022/155) that was submitted today. Why is it anti-Russian? I think there is no need to explain that — a cursory glance at the text will suffice. Why is it anti-Ukrainian? Because it without any doubt runs counter to the fundamental interests of the Ukrainian people insofar as it is an attempt to salvage and establish in Ukraine a system of power that has brought the country to the point of tragedy, which has persisted for at least eight years now. We thank those who did not support the draft resolution. I will not respond to those who just accused the Russian Federation of abusing the right of veto. The main reason for our negative vote is not based on what is included in the draft resolution but what it lacks. If its sponsors were to attempt to make it even remotely balanced, then they would not have left out issues that must be addressed and cannot be overlooked in the context of the Ukrainian problem. Specifically, what was left out is the fact that the Maidan junta, which assumed and seized power as a result of the anti-constitutional coup in Kyiv in February 2014, unleashed a war against the residents of the country’s east, shelling residential areas with artillery pieces and multiple rocket launchers, raining bombs on the people of Donetsk and Luhansk. What was left out was the way in which the Ukrainian authorities, with the connivance of their Western patrons, consistently and cynically shirked their responsibility to implement the Minsk agreements, the lynchpin of which was direct dialogue with the residents of the country’s east. At the same time, Ukrainian death squads, comprised largely of radical, neo-Nazi battalions, were positioned and deployed on a line of contact, methodically and relentlessly shelling the residential areas of the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic on a daily basis, killing women, children and the elderly. That situation continues. Just today four civilians died as a result of the actions of the Ukrainian armed forces. In addition, how can we fail to mention the blood- chilling crimes perpetrated by the Ukrainian nazis over the past eight years or the fact that the protesters against the Maidan in Odessa were burned alive? How can we fail to mention the fact that peaceful protesters on Maidan Square were shot at by unknown snipers? The investigation into both of those tragedies is something that has been deliberately dragged out and worn down by the Maidan regime. At the same time, the culprits in the Odessa tragedy are well known and do not seem to be hiding. Alternative, independent investigations and the confessions of the snipers themselves unambiguously confirm that the slaughter at Independence Square was provoked by Maidan leaders. Last year, we held an informal Arria Formula Security Council meeting on both of those issues with the aim of sharing more information with Security Council colleagues. However, what we heard in response from Western partners were at best merely cliches about so-called Russian propaganda. How can a resolution on the Ukrainian issue fail to mention those issues I just referred to? It would have been appropriate to include in the draft resolution an honest assessment of the role of our Western colleagues in fueling the Ukrainian crisis. Not only did they stand behind the Maidan coup but they also effectively issued a carte blanche to Kyiv to carry out acts and steps that would be unthinkable for any civilized State. That includes the egregious discrimination against the Russian language and consequently against Russian-language speakers. That includes the glorification of Hitler’s henchmen, alongside the ban on paying tribute to and honouring the real heroes of Ukraine who freed it of Nazism, as well as the religious schism in that country. While speakers are spinning tales about the triumph of democracy in Ukraine, the Maidan authorities and nationalists have been, murdering their political opponents with impunity. They have been persecuting the opposition. They have been closing down opposition television channels where one could get at least relatively objective information. Six of those television channels were closed down under President Zelenskyy alone. And how can we fail to mention the fact that the country has been flooded with weapons that were then used to kill civilians in Donbas? Our Western colleagues have made Ukraine a pawn in their geopolitical game, with no concern whatsoever for the interests of the Ukrainian people. The responsibility for what is transpiring at present lies not only with the Ukrainian Government but also with them. Today’s draft resolution is nothing other than yet another move in a brutal and inhumane chess game on this Ukrainian chessboard. At the moment, all Western media outlets have been inundated with reports about how civilian populations in Kyiv and a number of other Ukrainian cities have been seeking refuge in bomb shelters and how they fear for their lives and flee artillery fire. We genuinely empathize with our neighbours and we urge them not to yield to provocations. President Putin and the Russian Ministry of Defence explicitly stated that there would be no strikes targeting civilian infrastructure. However, nationalists are already using civilians as human shields. We categorically condemn the placement by nationalists of artillery and multiple rocket launchers in residential areas. That is a direct breach of the norms of international humanitarian law, including Articles 51 and 58 of the first Additional Protocol to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. We see how the situation is being exploited in propagandistic exercises by Western politicians and media outlets. I would like to ask them where they they have been for the past eight years. Why were they not concerned when shelling and killing occurred in Donbas? Why did they not even bother to notice that there are more than 4 million people living in the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic who, at best, were branded as pro-Russian separatists? Why did they not call out Poroshenko when he said that the residents of Donbas would rot in basements? Why did they not call out Zelenskyy when he called those same residents “non-people” and “specimens”? Parenthetically, I cannot but note that in the latest frenzy of propaganda our Western colleagues very frequently use imagery from Donbas, brandishing them as alleged consequences of the so-called Russian aggression in Ukraine. Those fake images are abundant and proliferate today. They have flooded the Internet and a number of Telegram channels. There are videos alleging Russian strikes targeting residential areas that were filmed in other parts of the world and have nothing to do with Ukraine. That was mentioned today by the BBC, which issued an article entitled “Ukraine conflict: many misleading images have been shared online”. There you can find everything. There are photographs from parades. There are My apologies, but before moving to a moment of silence, I want to include on the list those people who perished over all these years in Donbas. They, too, are worthy of being mentioned. All human lives are valuable. Let us not forget them either. I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine. In my capacity as the representative of the Russian Federation, I should like to make only one comment in order to calm Council members’ fears. There is a great deal to say about the statement made by the representative of Ukraine. I will let his boorishness weigh on his conscience and say nothing further about it. But let me say one thing. The Russian Ministry of Defence reported that “Yesterday, 24 February, units of the Russian paratrooper forces took full control of the area surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. An agreement was reached with Ukranian servicemen from the power plant special guard battalion about the joint provision of security for the power units and the sarcophagus at the power plant”. We do not want Ukraine to build a dirty bomb. The representative of the Russian Defence Ministry also noted that personnel at the power plant continued to carry out their tasks normally and were monitoring the situation of radioactivity: “The level of radioactivity surrounding the nuclear power plant is normal.” Vienna reports that the level of radiation at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is low, and there is no threat to the population, as announced on Friday by Rafael Grossi, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. There are no more names inscribed on the list of speakers. ","The Charter of the United Nations begins with the solemn invocation to peace: “We, the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save successive generations from the scourge of war...” That conviction has been the touchstone of the work in this Chamber since 1945. We must not forget that our fundamental purpose here is to protect people and their futures; to protect people from violence and conflict that destroy lives. As we speak, women and children in Kyiv, young families in Odessa, pensioners in Kharkiv and civilians all over Ukraine are sheltering from Russia’s military onslaught. First, Russia claimed that this was all Western hysteria. Then, it said that it was about Donetsk and Luhansk. Now, Russia is bombing Kyiv. We have seen dreadful images of Russian tanks crushing civilians in the Ukrainian capital. A country of 44 million people is being attacked on all fronts. Draft resolution S/2022/155, on which we are voting today, is a message to those people that the world is on their side and that it stands with the Ukrainian people. It is a message to the world that the rules we built together must be defended — because otherwise, who might be next? It is a message to Russia as well — to the brave Russian citizens who are protesting a war that they do not want. This draft resolution demands an end to that war. President Putin has launched a massive invasion of Ukraine. His aim is to remove its Government and subjugate its people. No fog of war is thick enough to obscure a truth that clear. This is not self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter. It is naked aggression. It is an unprovoked, unjustified war, and the Council must condemn it. A large majority of the Security Council has just voted in favour of a draft resolution aimed at stopping war. Draft resolution S/2022/155 has not been adopted only because of the single veto of the permanent member of the Council who is perpetrating that conflict. Russia claims that its invasion of Ukraine is in self-defence. That is absurd. Russia’s only act of self- defence is the vote that they have cast against today’s draft resolution. Make no mistake: Russia is isolated. It has no support for the invasion of Ukraine. History will record how we voted today and which countries stood up to be counted in defence of the Charter of the United Nations and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. The United Kingdom stands steadfast in support of the Ukrainian people and will hold Russia accountable for its aggression. ","We are here today because of Russia’s unprovoked, unjustified, unconscionable war on Ukraine. Let us never forget that this is a war of choice — Russia’s choice. Russia chose to invade its neighbour. Russia chose to inflict untold suffering on the Ukrainian people and its own citizens. Russia chose to violate Ukraine’s sovereignty, to violate international law, and to violate the Charter of the United Nations. Now, all across Ukraine, people are fleeing for their lives. Residents of Kyiv and Kharkiv have left their homes with only the belongings they could stuff in their backpacks to take shelter in subway stations, which have now become bomb shelters. We have seen reports of attacks on kindergartens and orphanages. Newborn babies in an intensive care unit have been evacuated to makeshift bomb shelters, too. We have seen heart-wrenching images of fathers sobbing as they say goodbye to their young children and send their families away to safety while they stay behind to defend their country. In Kyiv today, thousands of people crushed into a local train station, with mothers passing their children over the crowd, begging for people to help get their babies onto trains and to safety. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, more than 50,000 people have fled Ukraine in less than 48 hours. We have also seen everyday Russians bravely speak out and demonstrate in cities across Russia against President Putin’s decision to plunge them into a war with their neighbour. They do not want to sacrifice Russian lives for Putin’s ambition. The Council, charged with maintaining international peace and security, was created to prevent precisely this kind of aggression from ever happening again. Russia’s latest attack on our most fundamental principles is so bold and so brazen that it threatens our international system as we know it. We have a solemn obligation to not look away. We believe, to our core, that the noble intentions of this institution should still have a place in solving twenty-first century problems and shielding our children and our grandchildren from the horrors of war. The horrors of war are exactly what our Ukrainian brothers and sisters are experiencing today. The people of Ukraine will soon need food, water, shelter and medical aid. They will face displacement and lose everything they have worked to build. For those reasons, we and Albania, in consultation with our allies and partners, have proposed draft resolution S/2022/155 to hold Russia to account for its aggression against Ukraine. The draft resolution condemns Russia’s aggression. It reaffirms the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine and it demands that the Russian Federation immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw its forces. It also calls for the facilitation of rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian assistance to those in need in Ukraine and for the protection of civilians, including those who are humanitarian personnel. Today, we are taking a principled stand against Russia’s aggression in the Council, but many of us are taking action in our capitals to defend international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, and to impose severe consequences on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. In coordination with our allies and partners, we are imposing severe and immediate economic costs on Russia. Those measures include sweeping financial sanctions that will have an immediate impact on its economy and export controls that will cut off Russia’s access to vital technological inputs, atrophy its industrial base and undercut Russia’s strategic ambitions to exert influence on the world stage. In addition, as was just announced, President Biden will be sanctioning President Putin himself, along with Foreign Minister Lavrov and members of Russia’s national security team. Those actions are meant to complement the important work we are doing in the Security Council and the draft resolution we have put forward today. History will judge us for our actions — or lack thereof — and so long as we have a Security Council, I believe that we should strive to ensure that it lives up to its highest purposes: to prevent conflict and avert unnecessary war. Russia has already subverted that mission, but at a minimum — the very minimum — the rest of us have an obligation to object and to stand up for the United Nations Charter. To those who say that all parties are culpable, I say that is a clear cop out. One country — one country only — is invading another. Russia is the aggressor here. There is no middle ground. To any doubters, I say, look at the kindergarten that was bombed this morning — take a hard look. To those who say that there is a special history between Russia and Ukraine that somehow excuses the war, I say that we should all think carefully about who that label might apply to next. As I said on Monday night (see S/PV.8970), President Putin has asserted that Russia has a rightful claim to all territories from the Russian Empire. Just a few hours ago, Russia threatened Finland and Sweden with military and political repercussions. Responsible Member States do not invade their neighbours. They do not commit violence against their neighbours just because they have the ability to do so. That is the entire purpose of our international system. That is, fundamentally, the point of the Security Council and the United Nations. Today’s vote is therefore simple. Let me put it plainly. Members should vote in favour of the draft resolution if they believe in upholding the United Nations Charter. They should vote in favour if they support the right of Ukraine or any State to sovereignty and territorial integrity. They should vote in favour if they believe that Russia should be held to account for its actions. Members should vote against or abstain in the voting if they do not uphold the Charter and if they align themselves with the aggressive and unprovoked actions of Russia. Just as Russia had a choice, so do members of the Council. Not surprisingly, Russia exercised its veto power today in an effort to protect Russia’s premeditated, unprovoked, unjustified and unconscionable war in Ukraine. But let me make one thing clear: Russia can veto draft resolution S/2022/155, but it cannot veto our voices. It cannot veto the truth. It cannot veto our principles. It cannot veto the Ukrainian people. It cannot veto the Charter of the United Nations. And it will not veto accountability. Responsible members of the Security Council have stood together today in the face of Russia’s aggression and we will continue to stand with Ukraine, supporting it in every way we can. We are united behind Ukraine and its people, despite a reckless, irresponsible permanent member of the Council abusing its power to attack its neighbour and subvert the United Nations and our international system. Today’s vote showed which countries truly believe in supporting the core principles of the United Nations and which ones deploy them as convenient catchphrases. The vote showed which Security Council members support the United Nations Charter and which ones do not. We will be addressing this matter in the General Assembly, where the Russian veto does not apply and the nations of the world can, will and should hold Russia accountable and stand in solidarity with Ukraine. Before I conclude, I want to commend the true and tremendous courage that we are seeing from the Ukrainian people. I also want to thank the Ukrainian Permanent Representative, who is with us here today. Earlier today, President Biden spoke with President Zelenskyy and personally commended the brave actions of the Ukrainian people, who are fighting to defend their country. He also conveyed the ongoing economic, humanitarian and security support being provided by the United States, as well as our continued commitment to rally other countries to provide similar assistance. It is hard to imagine what it must feel like for people to see tanks rolling into their cities, bombs being dropped onto their streets and soldiers storming their parks and gardens. But in the face of all of that, everyday Ukrainian people are taking extraordinary actions to protect their children, to protect their country and to defend everything they hold dear. I also want to commend the courage of the thousands of people in Russia who are protesting Putin’s war, despite grave risks to their personal safety. They will keep chanting “no war”. They will keep asking how many Russian lives Putin wants to sacrifice for his cynical ambitions. As we move forward, I hope that more Member States take their cues from that courage and honour all of that bravery with more of our own. I am not going to respond to the atrocious lies, propaganda and disinformation that we have just heard from our Russian colleague. I have asked to take the floor for a different reason. I have asked to take the floor to recall some of our members whose names may not have been heard earlier. Due to the rapidly moving response to the events in Ukraine, the names of some of the countries that sponsored draft resolution S/2022/155 may not have been clearly read out or heard. I would just like to highlight their names because we greatly appreciate what they have done. Those countries are Barbados, Croatia, Estonia, the Gambia, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, Japan, Kiribati, Lesotho, the Marshall Islands, Monaco, North Macedonia, Palau, Papua New Guinea and Suriname. I want to thank all of them for their support. We will continue to all speak within one voice in the days ahead to address the atrocious situation that we see happening every day on the ground, despite what we have heard from our Russian colleagues. ","Let me begin by stating that my delegation subscribes to the statement just made by the Ambassador of the United States.We have been called here today to express clearly and loudly where our States stand, individually and collectively, with respect to international law and the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations to which we have agreed, as well as the international norms that we have collectively established to govern our relations as independent and sovereign countries, peace-loving nations and responsible international actors. As we speak, Ukraine is being bombed and people are being killed. A country in Europe is being destroyed by a more powerful country — its neighbour — that has decided it wants to turn back the clock of history. It is a permanent member of the Security Council — to which the world has given power and trust to decide on peace and security — that has decided instead to dominate and inflict death. With its unprovoked aggression, Russia is not only inflicting untold pain and causing an unprecedented humanitarian situation in Europe; it has stained the Charter of the United Nations with innocent blood. It is burying the Charter under the rubble of destruction in Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine. We must say no. It is not too late to stop this madness.Albania and the United States, together with many partners, have presented draft resolution S/2022/155, which condemns Russia’s actions and underscores that it must immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine and withdraw its forces. It calls on Russia to abide by the Minsk agreements. It also calls for the facilitation of humanitarian assistance to those in need in Ukraine — and their number is growing by the hour — and urges continuous efforts to respond to the humanitarian and refugee crisis that Russia’s aggression has created. The draft resolution echoes the call of the Secretary-General publicly addressing President Putin that, in the name of humanity, he bring his troops back to Russia. It echoes numerous similar calls around the globe at the highest level to stop the war. It is the minimum that we can do. We owe it to Ukraine — a Member of the United Nations — and to its people and the world.This is not just a defining moment for the Council. This is a day that will be long-remembered for one single aspect: our children — the succeeding generations — will know who stood up for respect for human life, international law, rules and solidarity with Ukraine, so that children, young girls, women and men — human beings — may live their lives free and in peace and dignity. And they will remember who did not. This is not a moment to look away; it is a moment to speak.We call on the members of the Council to support We call on the members of the Council to support the draft resolution in order to say no to aggression; to say no to an unprovoked war; and to say no to the domination of a country by a more powerful one.We deeply regret the decision of the Russian Federation to veto draft resolution S/2022/155. The Security Council lost a precious opportunity to show the world its unity, power and usefulness. Instead, it was blocked — it was taken hostage. We are disappointed, but not surprised.This is not the end of our efforts. We will continue to work with the Member States of the United Nations, those who stand for rules and not chaos and those who base their relations with others on respect and not contempt. We continue to condemn this aggression and call for ending this senseless war. Russia may inflict damage, kill people, overthrow a legitimate Government and try to destroy Ukraine, but as history teaches it will never be able to kill freedom.Instead, Russia will be held responsible for the consequences of its actions. It is already facing worldwide condemnation. As we heard, it will face sanctions and restrictions, such as the suspension of its rights today in the Council of Europe. But it will not be able to destroy European security, nor will it be able to set back the world. We will continue to stand with Ukraine and as Prime Minister Rama announced today, Albania, in its tradition, is ready if needed to shelter Ukrainians fleeing the war. In conclusion, let me reiterate that Albania supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.","Ireland voted in favour of draft resolution S/2022/155, presented by the United States and Albania in response to the Russian Federation’s flagrant violation of the Charter of United Nations, international law and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.The Russian Federation has turned its back on diplomacy. It has spurned genuine offers of dialogue and rejected repeated calls from the international community for de-escalation. Instead, it has launched an unjustified and unprovoked attack on Ukraine, an attack that continues today to rain death and destruction on Ukraine and its people. We condemn those actions outright. In casting our vote today, we did so in full solidarity with the people of Ukraine.The Security Council has a responsibility to act in the face of conflict, protect international peace and security and uphold the principles that the world agreed upon in response to the utter devastation of the Second World War. That is not a responsibility that Ireland takes lightly. Yet it is one that we were prevented from discharging today, in spite of the clear and declared will of the great majority of the members of the Council.We deeply regret the Russian Federation’s use of the veto today. The veto is an anachronism that has no place in today’s world. The use of the veto to block Council action is always unacceptable. Its use today in blatant defence of military aggression is reprehensible.However, the veto in no way obscures the plain facts of Russian aggression against Ukraine. Nor will it hinder the international community’s response to Russia’s blatant breaches of international law, as demonstrated by the broad co-sponsorship of today’s draft resolution by the wider United Nations membership. In that context, Ireland strongly supports the comprehensive sanctions announced yesterday by the European Union. We stand ready to support further measures if Russia does not reverse course.The unfolding horror of the recent days is a tragedy for the people of Ukraine and one which evokes nightmares that the people of Europe fervently hoped had been consigned to a bloodstained history. Only dialogue and diplomacy offer escape from those nightmares. We call on Russia to end its aggression against Ukraine today, turn away from war and choose the path of dialogue and diplomacy. That is the right path, and the time to take it is now.","Norway voted in favour of draft resolution S/2022/155. We deeply regret Russia’s veto. Preventing and ending acts of aggression is a direct responsibility of the Security Council. A veto cast by the aggressor undermines the purpose of the Council. It is a violation of the very foundation of the Charter of the United Nations. Furthermore, in the spirit of the Charter, as a party to a dispute Russia should have abstained from voting on the draft resolution.As we sat here in the Chamber on Wednesday (see S/PV.8974), we could see the shocking first images of what now amounts to a full-scale Russian invasion of a free and independent Member State. We can only imagine the hardships the people of Ukraine are going through.With its tanks, missiles, bombs, planes, warships and cyberattacks, the Russian Federation’s aggression not only violates the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine but also constitutes a serious breach of international peace and security. Russia has disregarded the very core principles of the rules-based world order that the United Nations has stood for since the Second World War.Let me be absolutely clear. Norway insists that the Russian Federation immediately, completely and unconditionally stop all fighting and withdraw all of its forces from the territory of Ukraine. Russia must respect the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. Norway expresses full solidarity with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in the face of Russian aggression.Indeed, we already see the dire consequences for civilians, with casualties and injuries among large numbers of children, women and men. We fear increased suffering in the time ahead, with potentially large numbers of casualties and extensive destruction of civilian infrastructure, such as schools, medical facilities and water and electricity plants. We see fighting unfolding in and around urban areas.We are deeply concerned about the long-term and protracted harm to the civilian population caused by such warfare, including by the use of heavy explosive weapons. We already see mass displacement. That will only increase, together with trauma, family separations and missing persons. The situation is a tragedy, both for individuals and Ukrainian society at large.The parties to the conflict in Ukraine must comply with their obligations under international law, including human rights law and international humanitarian law, and must ensure the protection of the civilian population and detainees. Space for neutral, impartial and independent humanitarian action must be protected to ensure safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access to those in need.We condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine. The Council must now carry out the great responsibility of its mandate and act in a determined and united manner to stop the ongoing aggression against a Member State.We also condemn Belarus for facilitating those attacks. Norway will join our allies and partners in swift and concrete countermeasures. That includes Norway’s alignment with the intensified sanctions of the European Union.Let me conclude by reiterating Norway’s unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.","India is deeply disturbed by the recent turn of developments in Ukraine. We urge that every effort be made for the immediate cessation of violence and hostilities. No solution is worth the cost of human lives. We are also deeply concerned about the welfare and security of the Indian community, including a large number of Indian students in Ukraine.The contemporary global order was built upon the Charter of the United Nations, international law and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. All Member States need to honour those principles in finding a constructive way forward. Dialogue is the only answer to settling differences and disputes, however daunting it may appear at this moment. It is regrettable that the path of diplomacy was given up. We must return to it. For all of those reasons, India chose to abstain in the voting on the draft resolution.","Mexico will vote in favour of draft resolution S/2022/155, submitted by Albania and the United States for the following reasons.First, we are confronted with the invasion of one sovereign country by another, which constitutes a flagrant violation of Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter of the United Nations and also constitutes an act of aggression under the terms of General Assembly resolution 3314 (XXIX), adopted by all Member States of the United Nations.Secondly, Mexico has itself endured four invasions in its history as an independent State,: two by France and two by the United States. The first invasion by the United States, in 1846, resulted in the loss of almost half of our national territory at that time.Thirdly, Mexico has always condemned all acts of aggression, as evidenced by our protests at the League of Nations against Italy’s annexations of Ethiopia and Albania and Germany’s annexation of Austria.Fourthly, our rejection of the use of force led us to convene the Inter-American Conference on the Problems of War and Peace, held in Mexico City in 1945, in order to bring to the San Francisco Conference a clear and defined regional position on that issue.Fifthly, Mexico has a pacifist foreign policy. Since the United Nations was established, my country has defended the prohibition of the threat or use of force in international relations and we will continue to do so in this Organization and in all other forums.Sixthly, in 1988 we enshrined in our Constitution the principles of the Charter of the United Nations as normative principles of our foreign policy.For all those reasons, Mexico condemns the acts of aggression that the Russian Federation has perpetrated against Ukraine. We call on the parties to immediately cease hostilities. We recognize the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine and support the efforts of the Secretary-General to find a diplomatic solution in order to prevent further suffering of the civilian population.As a result of our historical experience and in line with our constitutional mandate, Mexico will support the draft resolution that is before the Security Council.","Ghana voted in favour of draft resolution S/2022/155, on the situation in Ukraine, which was not adopted, because — as a member of the Security Council — that is the minimum duty that we owe to the Charter of the United Nations, the peoples of the world and in particular the Government and people of Ukraine. We join 10 other members of the Council in seeking to deplore in the strongest terms the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine because that act breaches Russia’s obligation as a member of the United Nations and its obligation to respect the provisions of Article 2, paragraph 4 of the Charter.By not refraining from the use of force in its relations with Ukraine, the Russian Federation has chosen to violate without justification the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, even as several world leaders have appealed for dialogue to find a peaceful settlement to the situation. The Russian Federation’s actions, which have assailed the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, have threatened the global order and the balance of peace and security.We have also taken note of the letter from the Russian Federation submitted to the Security Council, which seeks to indicate that its use of force against Ukraine was in self-defence while dismissing its all-out military action against Ukraine. We are pained by the unnecessary and rising number of deaths that have been occasioned by the invasion and we call on the Russian Federation to immediately withdraw its forces from Ukraine and to recommit to dialogue and diplomacy.Besides our own assessment that Ukraine presented no immediate threat to the Russian Federation, the letter is also interpreted in the context of Russia’s own public declarations about the cost of the past days, which have shown to the world that rather than a security merit, this has been about Russia using force against its weaker neighbour because it could.At the beginning of its military build-up on the borders of Ukraine, we were told that what was being observed was a normal military exercise. When concerns about the massive build-up were raised, the Russian Federation informed the world that its troops were on its side of the borders and had no intention of crossing the frontiers of Ukraine. At one point we were also informed that the possibility of sending troops to the Donbas region of Ukraine in the context of peacekeeping was under consideration. Today the whole world knows better. As we met in an emergency session on Wednesday night (see S/PV.8974) to afford yet another opportunity for peace, the trust and good faith crucial for diplomatic engagement was broken in a cruel and dismissive manner. The battle against Kyiv may yet be won, but the good will of the world has been lost. The use of force as a basis for securing international agreement has no place in our modern international order and the world cannot accept this. Ghana is deeply disappointed by the actions of the Russian Federation, a permanent member of the Security Council. Its actions have fallen short of the highest standards expected of those States that are considered to be the enduring guardians of international peace and security. Indeed, for those members of the Council with a special privilege, there is also a special responsibility.I reiterate Ghana’s full support for the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in accordance with the Charter. At a time when the world looks to the Council to send a strong message that threats and use of force against other States are unacceptable, we have been unable to do so — not because there is no broad agreement to do so but because the way and manner in which the Security Council has been structured to function has constrained us.The present situation creates difficult choices that we all must consider and carefully reflect upon as we proceed with the long-standing efforts to reform the Security Council and how it operates. Fortunately, the ongoing process in the General Assembly provides an opportunity. All Member States must genuinely commit to that process. If we fail to act proactively, our inaction will cost us permanently.Before concluding, let me indicate Ghana’s continuing concern about the situation of the civilian populations in all parts of the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine, as well as the welfare of the more than 1,000 Ghanaian students and several nationals in that country. We recall that in accordance with international humanitarian law, there are consequences for unlawful actions against civilian populations.Also, as the Secretary-General rightly said in his press engagement on Wednesday night, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia will come at great cost to most of our countries. Already, the price of oil has surpassed $100. Inflation in most of our countries has begun to rise. Investment decisions are being pulled back. The already difficult situation of economic stagnation triggered by the coronavirus disease pandemic is beginning to worsen. The consequences of those adverse developments are that the fragility of most of our countries will deepen, creating further risks to global stability. The actions that have been taken against Ukraine are therefore far-reaching and require even greater solidarity — above all for the people of Ukraine, who bear the direct and immediate impact of an unjustified action that violates the Charter and the principles of international law, and in addition for the many countries, especially developing countries, whose populations are facing severe austerity. Will we find the wisdom and common purpose to overcome the difficult moment we face? I raise the call for peace. Let us give peace yet a chance.","We live in unprecedented circumstances of threat to the international order and of violation of the Charter of the United Nations. We are gravely concerned about the Russian military operations against targets in sovereign Ukrainian territory. We believe that the Security Council should strive to show a united resolve in pursuing diplomatic solutions to all threats to international peace and security and to seek agreement also on the Ukrainian crisis.As we hear reports of increasing civilian casualties, fear and devastation in Ukraine — a scenario that any war inevitably generates — our main objective now is to stop the ongoing hostilities immediately. How should we do that?First, the Security Council must react swiftly to the use of force against the territorial integrity of a Member State. A line has been crossed and the Council cannot remain silent.Secondly and no less important, we need to create the conditions for dialogue among all parties involved. The world cannot afford a point of no return, at which parties see military victory as the only avenue to end conflict. During the negotiations on the draft resolution, Brazil attempted to seek such a balance and to maintain a space for dialogue, while still signalling that the use of force against the territorial integrity of a Member State is not acceptable in the world today.We are also deeply concerned about Russia’s decision to engage troops in military operations on the ground and the loss of life and danger to the civilian population that may ensue. We continue to hold the firm conviction that threats and force will not lead to a lasting settlement to this crisis.Military action will inflict damage, undermine faith in international law and put the lives of millions of people in jeopardy.The mission of the Security Council is not over. If our efforts have so far failed to prevent a war, it is our duty to persevere and seek the immediate suspension of hostilities. We should strive to find ways to restore peace to Ukraine and the whole region. We renew our appeal for the full cessation of hostilities, the withdrawal of troops and the immediate resumption of diplomatic dialogue. There is no alternative to negotiation to solve the present crisis.The security concerns voiced by the Russian Federation over the past few years, particularly regarding the strategic balance in Europe, do not give Russia the right to threaten the territorial integrity and sovereignty of another State. The Security Council has the legitimacy to debate and, with the good will of all, adopt measures to redress this dangerous situation.The collective security system of the United Nations rests ultimately on the pillar of international law. The sovereign equality and territorial integrity of Member States are not hollow words. It is our duty to give concrete meaning to the high aspirations of the drafters of the Charter of the United Nations. That is our most valuable legacy. To rid ourselves of the scourge of war was the very reason for the establishment of the United Nations. In the end, peace and international order must prevail. We shall not rest until that mission is accomplished. Brazil regrets that the Security Council was unable to react to a breach of international peace and security that is still happening as we speak. During the negotiations, Brazil favoured a text that could maintain space for dialogue among all the parties, while sending a decisive message for respect for international law and the basic principles that for more than 75 years have saved us from a war of broad proportions. We thank the proponents for their flexibility with respect to several aspects of the draft during the negotiations.The framing of the use of force against Ukraine as an act of aggression in the draft, a precedent that has seldom been used in the Council, signals to the world the gravity of the situation but could also downplay other times when force was used against the territorial integrity of Member States with no equivalent reaction from the Council. Indeed, we could have ended up with a text that is more conducive to reconciliation. Brazil has fought for that.However, under the current circumstances, not even a different text would have been enough to allow the Council to fulfil its responsibility to maintain international peace and security today. No country, elected or non-elected, with or without veto power, should be able to use force against the territorial integrity of another State with no Council reaction. The Council’s paralysis when world peace is at stake could lead to its irrelevance when we need it most. It is our collective responsibility not to allow that to happen.","Kenya voted in favour of draft resolution S/2022/155 to affirm Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations, according to which all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State. We voted yes to register our opposition to the breaching of the territorial integrity of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. We voted with hearts that are heavy with sympathy for the people of Ukraine. We offer our condolences to all the Ukrainian families that have suffered the devastating loss of loved ones to this unnecessary war. Our affirmative vote today transcends the tragedy unfolding in Ukraine.We voted yes also having in mind the justifications for past interventions by other powerful States, using resolutions from this very Security Council that seriously compromised international peace and security. Even as deserved condemnations ring out today about the breach of Ukraine’s sovereignty, history’s condemnations are allowed silence in this room. We cannot help but recall that Africa’s Sahel region is in terrible turmoil due to the hasty and ill-considered intervention in Libya a decade ago.On that occasion, the African Union sought more time for diplomacy. Its Peace and Security Council was ignored and what resulted was not peace or the safety and security of the Libyan people. Instead, terror was unleashed on African peoples in the countries to the south of Libya. There have been yet other actions of similar magnitude that have brought us to this unfortunate pass. Today the precious fabric of our Charter lies torn and trampled and is threatened with further harm if there is no urgent and visionary leadership with a faith in diplomacy pushing in the opposite direction.If the United Nations Charter could speak for itself, it would vote for the draft resolution in order to affirm its central role in safeguarding our collective peace. It would remind all members of the Security Council and the United Nations that the Charter contains the tools for the pacific settlement of their disputes by negotiation, inquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice. By failing to adopt the draft resolution, we deeply regret that the Security Council has failed to stop the infringement of the sovereignty of a member of the United Nations.","We all agree that the serious developments in Ukraine undermine regional and international peace and security. Throughout this crisis, my country has consistently called for de-escalation and dialogue. We placed great hope in the various diplomatic initiatives and channels aimed at resolving the crisis and those calls reflected our alarm at the consequences of this crisis for civilians present in Ukraine, as well as for the region and the international community. We emphasize the importance of ensuring that humanitarian assistance reaches those in need and we call on all parties to respect international humanitarian law, prioritize the protection of civilians and allow for the unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance.We believe that every Member State of the United Nations has the right to security, sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. Being from the Middle East, we are intimately aware of the critical importance of a stable regional security environment and of de-escalation, diplomacy and dialogue as the basis of that security. Similarly, we understand from experience — and share — the need for inclusive and consultative processes. We support the draft resolution’s emphasis on the need to adhere to the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. That must be the basis of the resumption of dialogue and the pathway forward now that the draft resolution has not been adopted.The United Arab Emirates restates its commitment to the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of all Member States of the United Nations. We urge an immediate de-escalation and cessation of hostilities and we once more underscore our readiness to work with members of the Security Council towards that goal. The results of the voting were a foregone conclusion, but the avenues for dialogue and diplomacy must remain open more urgently than ever before and we must pursue them together. That is the clear sentiment that the Council is united on.","Today the Security Council is tasked with reaffirming the fundamental principles that underpin its existence. The main objective of the United Nations, which was established at the end of a deadly war, has been to prevent and deter another such conflict. Many nations and peoples of the world still struggle to cleanse themselves of the afflictions of the wars of the past. Meanwhile, we are trying to decisively address the multiple vulnerabilities and fragilities that pose a threat to humankind. We do not need new wars or new fears.War is the denial of the aspirations of the peoples of the world. War sows death and destruction. It causes terrible and often irreparable devastation and trauma. War never has any real winners, but only serves to inflict horrific suffering and perpetuate a vicious cycle of resentment.My country is committed to peace and the founding principles of the Charter of the United Nations and supports a fairer, rules-based international order. For those reasons, today we will condemn a war against a Member State of the United Nations. My country joins all those who condemn the war today, in the hope that the language we have used to reaffirm the principles of the Charter will never again be left open to interpretation, and that wherever the principles on which our position is based are violated they will always be defended with the same determination and vigour.The international community owes it to itself to seize this momentum to take a hard, critical look at itself and refrain from engaging anywhere in the world in all wars of choice, all wars of influence, all hegemonic wars, all resource-driven wars and all unjust and dehumanizing wars. The international stage must not be like a jungle in which nations are either predators or prey.In conclusion, we wish to reiterate our call for an immediate ceasefire and de-escalation. We urge the belligerents not to obstruct humanitarian aid access for the populations in need. We call on all parties to resume dialogue and commit to settling the conflict peacefully. The responsibilities that we must assume today and every day as members of the Council compel us to defend, reaffirm and renew the commitment we made 77 years ago: to save current and succeeding generations from the scourge of war.","I will not dignify the Russian diabolical script — which resembles a letter of application for an upscale seat in hell — by commenting on it.I would like to use this opportunity to thank the parents of every Ambassador here; to thank the people of the democratic nations who put these Ambassadors in their seats; to tell the children of these Ambassadors that they should be proud of their parents who have voted in favour of the draft resolution.I thank my good friend Nicolas from France, Ronaldo from Brazil, my good friend Mr. Hoxha from Albania, Linda, Barbara and Mona. I thank my good friend from Mexico, Martin from Kenya, Ireland, Ghana and Gabon. I thank the dozens and dozens of co-sponsors who would have voted in favour of the draft resolution if they had had a chance to vote. They will have that chance in days to come.The draft resolution recalls the obligation of all States under Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State.The draft resolution called on Russia to stop its offensive against Ukraine. The memories are very fresh. The Security Council was discussing the ways to prevent the war quite recently in this very Chamber. At the very same moment, deadly air strikes were dropped on civilian heads across my country and Russian troops crossed the Ukrainian border from the territory of Russia. The territory of Belarus was used for missile attacks and the troops were marching from the occupied parts of the Ukrainian Donbas and Crimea.Last night was the most horrific for Kyiv since — just imagine — 1941 when it was attacked by Nazis. Last night it was attacked by someone who pretends they are fighting with neo-Nazis. I am therefore not surprised that Russia voted against the draft resolution. Russia is keen on continuing its Nazi-style course of action. The Kremlin regime should not be called the Russian regime. The Kremlin regime should be called the “Russist regime”. A couple of hours ago my President said “Tonight the enemy will use all the forces at their disposal to break our resistance — vile, cruel and inhuman. Tonight they will storm. We must all understand what awaits us. We have to persevere tonight. The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.”We just heard something that the Russian Ambassador wanted to present as assurances from himself and from his leadership: that it is all provocation. He urged us not to yield to provocations. Do Council members remember how many times he said that or how many times his deputy said in this very room that there will be no invasion, no attacks? Do Council members remember that during the previous meeting he was walking out of the Chamber trying to call someone, not knowing what was going on? How can we trust him? How can we trust his assurances? He has no idea what is on the mind of his President. His words have less value than a hole in a New York pretzel.The Russian Federation, which by treachery occupied the seat of a Security Council member in 1991, daily violates not only the Charter but also the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council. Indeed, if Russia did not violate the provisional rules, then Mr. Nebenzia would have to follow rule 20, which states in relation to the President of the Security Council that“for the proper fulfillment of the responsibilities of the presidency, he should not preside over the Council during the consideration of a particular question with which the member he represents” — that is, the Russian Federation — “is directly connected, he shall indicate his decision to the Council” not to preside.So since the Council is not ruled by the current presidency on the basis of rules, I, too, will probably be unruly and ask all here to dedicate a moment of complete silence to pray, or to meditate if they do not believe in God, for peace — to pray for the souls of those who have already been killed and for the souls of those who may be killed, and I invite the Russian Ambassador to pray for salvation. I would suggest that we spend a moment in complete silence.I shall now continue with my statement.I am saddened, however, that a small handful of members seem to still be tolerating the war. No complex historical context can be used to justify what is going on. I would say to some that it is exactly because of the safety of their nationals right now in Ukraine that they should be the first to vote to stop the war to save their nationals in Ukraine, and not think about whether they should or should not vote, because of the safety of their nationals. Nothing can justify the missile shelling of a kindergarten, an orphanage and hospitals that took place today. In fact, one of my relatives had a stroke a few days ago and cannot be evacuated even to a shelter, because that person cannot be moved and so is in the hospital in the city of Kyiv. Those attacks are war crimes and violations of the Rome Statute, whether one is a party to it or not.We are gathering those and other facts and will immediately send them on to The Hague, and responsibility is inevitable. Nothing can justify today’s deliberate shelling by a Russian warship of a Moldovan-flagged chemical tanker with a Russian crew — imagine — or a Panamanian-flagged cargo ship near the port of Odessa, in the Black Sea. That is a flagrant violation of the international law of the sea.Is this the time to discuss historical reflections against the backdrop of the alarming situation at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which has been seized by Russian armed troops? They detained the staff of the nuclear power plant, not allowing them to rotate as required by technical safety rules.Another matter of concern there is that the control levels of gamma radiation, those in the exclusion zone, have already been exceeded because of damage to the topsoil owing to the movement of a great deal of heavy military equipment, including tanks, and, as a result, there has been contamination by radioactive dust.As of midnight the previous night, almost 140 persons had been killed and 316 others wounded on the Ukrainian side during the first day of the Russian invasion. Many civilian infrastructure objects were ruined. To stop the advance of the Russian tanks, a young gentleman, a hero, blew himself up on a bridge. He killed himself in order to destroy the bridge and prevent the Russian tanks from moving ahead.But the destruction is not only taking place in cities. Indeed, 80 per cent of the infrastructure of the small town of Schastia, located in the Government-controlled part of Donbas, has been completely destroyed, according to the local administration. The name of the town can be translated as “happiness”; that is actually the name of the town. What a grotesque irony. That speaks volumes as to what kind of happiness the Russian Federation will be bringing to Donbas, to Ukraine and to other nations sooner or later if we continue to allow Russia to go ahead with its diabolical plan. The Ambassador can rest assured that there will be no hospitality shown to his troops on our territory.Ukraine has been exercising its right to self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter. Russia does not have that excuse. Its perverse reading of the Charter is so sick that it is impossible to interpret. Calling occupying troops peacekeepers, claiming the right of self-defence — that is lunacy.The Russian troops are suffering heavy losses in aircraft, helicopters, tanks, trucks and, most importantly, personnel. Russia can stop the voting in this Chamber, but what may stop the war, unfortunately, are the thousands of bodies of Russian soldiers that will be delivered to their mothers in Russia, whether you like it or not, because we have to defend our territories. We have to defend ourselves on our territory.Thousands of Ukrainians have already joined the Ukrainian army or the Territorial Defence Forces, and the resolve and dedication of civilians joining the Territorial Defence Forces are the best proof that we will not surrender, even if Russia succeeds in temporarily occupying additional chunks of our territory.Ukraine has broken diplomatic relations with Russia — something that should have been done eight years ago. We call on our partners to follow our example or to find other ways to sever diplomatic relationships with Russia. We call on international organizations to ban or suspend Russia’s memberships. The latter has happened today, in fact, as the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, by an overwhelming majority — almost by consensus — adopted a decision to suspend the Russian Federation’s rights of representation in the Committee of Ministers and in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.Russia should never have been invited to join the Council in the first place. It was invited to join the Council of Europe — a temple of human rights — in the very middle of the war in Chechnya, even before the Khasavyurt Accord. For hypocritical political reasons, the Europeans were then of the opinion that it was better to invite Russia — and it was invited — in the middle of the war, as it was killing thousands and thousands of its own citizens in Chechnya.We count upon the proper reaction by the international community to the medieval atrocities committed by Russia in Ukraine. Today, a number of countries have already imposed sanctions on Russia. The burden must be heavy. If you say that sanctions are nothing, I am sure that the bodies of dead Russian soldiers are not nothing, even if you are completely diabolical.We are sincerely grateful to the United Nations for its prompt decision to support the humanitarian response in Ukraine, and we highly commend the United Nations efforts to encourage major humanitarian donors to make additional funding available. I thank the Secretary-General for his statement to that effect. I have a plea: “Stop harassing the Secretary-General. Stop attacking him. Show respect for the institution. Stop wiping your feet on the Secretary General, who is a very nice person and a dedicated supporter of the Charter of the United Nations.”We remain open to negotiations, but no one should put words in our mouth or manipulate our statements about negotiations. We are sick of Russia’s interpretations. Let Russia speak on its own behalf and not on ours. It was stated by the President of Ukraine that we are open to negotiations on a permanent basis. We have been saying that all along. It is Russia that killed the Normandy format. It is Russia that killed the Minsk agreements. All that gibberish about who said what and when in the Normandy format can by no means justify the offensive. By no means can it justify thousands and thousands of Russian troops on our territory. The President of Russia today called on the Ukrainian army to remove the Government of Ukraine. Is he crazy? Russia should show respect for the core principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter: sovereign equality, non-use of force or threat of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of States.In my opening remarks, I said that the parents of all Ambassadors here are proud of their children and that the children of the Ambassadors are proud of their parents. It is so painful to imagine what your family must think about you when you lie every day. The Russian people deserve peace and democracy. The Russian people deserve liberty, and they will have it — if not tomorrow, because tomorrow is not possible, but probably in the near future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S/PV.8974,23/02/2022,"Russia's recognition of the separatist ""republics"" in the East of Ukraine and escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian crisis (covering the start of the 24 February Russian invasion in Ukraine, which happened during the SC session)","The situation in Ukraine is at a critical juncture. China has been paying close attention to the situation. In the current context, all parties concerned should exercise restraint and refrain from any further escalation of tensions. We believe that the door to a peaceful solution to the Ukraine issue is not fully shut, and neither should it be. China has repeatedly pointed out that the Ukraine issue is set against a complex historical backdrop and that the current situation is the result of the interplay of many factors. China’s position on safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States has been consistent. The purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations should be jointly upheld. We hope that all parties concerned will remain cool- headed and rational and commit themselves to enhancing dialogue and consultation to resolve the relevant issues properly through negotiations and address each other’s legitimate security concerns, in line with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. It is especially important at the moment to refrain from fuelling tensions. China will continue to promote peace talks in its own way and welcomes and encourages all efforts aimed at a diplomatic solution. ","I thank the Secretary General for his engagement and for his appeal, which France fully supports. As we speak, Russia is on the verge of causing chaos in Ukraine and dealing an unjustifiable blow to peace and security in the heart of Europe. For several months, the President of the Russian Federation has been patiently preparing the ground for a major offensive against Ukraine. He has amassed soldiers and weapons on a scale not seen since the end of the Second World War. He has incited violence through lies and disinformation. He has even denied the very legitimacy of the Ukrainian State. He has undermined the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine by recognizing the independence of parts of Ukrainian territory. In the face of that strategy of threats and destabilization, Ukraine has shown admirable restraint. It did not give in to violence despite Russian incitement. I want to reiterate our solidarity with the Ukrainian people, which President Macron confirmed to his Ukrainian counterpart a few hours ago. In the face of that strategy of disorder and confrontation, the leaders of Europe and the United States have demonstrated their unity and redoubled their efforts to propose a diplomatic solution. President Macron, together with Chancellor Scholz and many partners, have done their utmost. They have expressed their willingness to build a renewed security architecture for Europe with Russia. France strongly condemns the Russian President’s strategy of provocation to war. We hear the appeal of the Ukrainian people, made by President Zelenskyy in his address to the Russian nation a few hours ago: the Ukrainians want peace. They want a good neighbourly relationship with Russia, like the familial and personal relationships that unite so many Russians and Ukrainians. The international community came together to make its voice heard today in the General Assembly. It is the voice of respect for the Charter of the United Nations, the voice of peaceful conflict resolution and the voice of diplomacy. It echoes the clear statements of the Secretary-General. We call once again on the Russian Federation to follow that path, to reverse its decision to recognize the separatist entities in eastern Ukraine and to recall its troops. We call on each member of the Council to act responsibly and to demonstrate resolute support for all initiatives aimed at preventing and putting an end to violations of the Charter of the United Nations. If Russia confirms its choice of war, it will have to take full responsibility and pay the price for that choice. As we convene in an emergency meeting in order to try to avert the worst and to prevent the start of a war, we have learned, alongside all gathered here, that the President of the Russian Federation has ordered a special military operation in Donbas and that Russia will try to demilitarize Ukraine. Russia has opted for war. France condemns in the strongest terms the start of those operations. Those decisions, announced precisely during this Security Council meeting, show the contempt Russia has for international law and the United Nations. Russia must be held accountable before the Security Council. That is why, over the next few hours, France will join its partners on the Council in the preparation of a draft resolution to condemn the war waged by Russia. We call on all members of the Council to support us in these tragic circumstances. We call on the Russian Federation to fully respect international humanitarian law. We call for the protection of, and respect for, all civilians, especially the vulnerable — women, children and humanitarian personnel. ","In accordance with rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite the representatives of Germany and Ukraine to participate in this meeting. In accordance with rule 39 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, to participate in this meeting. The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. I wish to warmly welcome the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. António Guterres, to whom I now give the floor. I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the Russian Federation. We have had a very intense day as we discuss the crisis in Ukraine. I will not repeat what I said earlier today in the General Assembly (see A/76/PV.58). I can state with regret only that, ultimately, Ukraine did not heed our message to Kyiv concerning the need to stop provocations against the Luhansk People’s Republic and the Donetsk People’s Republic. It appears that our Ukrainian colleagues, whom certain States have supported and egged on recently, remain under the illusion that, with the blessing of Western sponsors, they can secure a military solution to the problem of Donbas. It is otherwise difficult to explain the increase in shelling and acts of sabotage on the territory of the Republics. Over the past 24 hours, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine has recorded nearly 2,000 ceasefire violations, including almost 1,500 explosions. The residents of Donetsk and Luhansk continue to shelter in basements. Refugees continue to flow into Russia. In a word, the nature of provocations by Ukraine’s armed forces has not changed. Members would prefer to ignore that fact and repeat Ukraine’s fairy tales that those living in Donetsk are bombing themselves. It is no surprise that the ever-increasing suffering of those living in Donbas does not appear to affect our Western colleagues. At today’s General Assembly debate, they were unable to find one word of compassion or sympathy for the residents of Donbas. It is as if, for them, those 4 million people do not exist. I would like to recall that the principles of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, of which we are accused of violating in Ukraine, as stipulated in the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States, must be strictly observed with regard to “States conducting themselves in compliance with the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples ... and thus possessed of a government representing the whole people belonging to the territory without distinction as to race, creed or colour.” That does not describe the current Government in Ukraine. The tragedy in Ukraine began just after the illegal Maidan coup in 2014, when instead of engaging in dialogue with the Russian-speaking people of Ukraine, the new Government unleashed guns and aviation on them. There is an abundance of information and evidence to that effect, but our Western colleagues choose to ignore it. We tried yesterday, today and the day before yesterday to explain to members the logic behind the decisions taken by the Russian leadership on the recognition of the Luhansk People’s Republic and Donetsk People’s Republic, and emphasized the need to ensure peace and security in those territories. However, they did not want to listen then or today. For our Western colleagues, the people living in the Donbas are nothing but a bargaining chip in a geopolitical game aimed at weakening Russia and moving the NATO bloc closer to its borders. For us, they are women, children and elderly people who have had to hide from Ukrainian bombardments and provocations for eight years now. For us, they are Ukrainians who suffer under the oppression of the Maidan Government. That is the difference in our approaches. Without seeing our geopolitical perspective, one will never understand us. But those for whom the decisions that I mentioned earlier were made have been forgotten and disregarded during the past eight years and labelled as mere pro-Russian separatists and terrorists, and they are eternally grateful to us. And this is what really matters to us. I would like to reiterate that the cause of today’s crisis surrounding Ukraine is rooted in the actions of Ukraine itself, which has been sabotaging its commitments under the Minsk package of measures for years. As recently as last week, there was hope that Kyiv would come to its senses and actually implement what it promised to do in 2015. To that end, first and foremost, direct dialogue with Donetsk and Luhansk was needed. However, yet another confirmation of Ukraine’s unwillingness to engage in such dialogue and take steps to grant Donbas the special status stipulated in the Minsk agreements, and the support of Western sponsors for that position, ultimately convinced us that we simply did not have the right to allow the continued suffering of the residents of Donbas. As I said, Ukrainian provocations against the people of Donbas have not only continued, but have intensified. The leadership of the Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics have asked us to provide military support in accordance with the bilateral cooperation agreements concluded at the time as their recognition. That is a logical step and a consequence of the actions of the Ukrainian regime. During the course of this meeting, Russian President Vladimir Putin made an address in which he said that he had decided to launch a special military operation in Donbas. We do not know all the details today, but I want to briefly inform the Council of his rationale — what clearly follows from his message is that the occupation of Ukraine is not part of our plans. The purpose of the special operation is to protect people who have been subjected to abuse and genocide by the Kyiv regime for eight years. To that end, we will work towards the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine and bring to justice the perpetrators of numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including citizens of the Russian Federation. That decision was made in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the Charter of the United Nations, the approval of the Federation Council of the Russian Federation and pursuant to the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance signed with the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics. We are receiving a great deal of information on the matter, which has yet to be analysed. We will keep the Council updated. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. I give the floor to representative of Ukraine. Speaking in my capacity as the representative of the Russian Federation, I was not planning to answer the questions posed because I have already said all I know at this point. Waking Minister Lavrov at this time is not something I intend to do. The representative of Ukraine referenced the information that we have, which we will provide. In addition, this is not called a war; it is called a special military operation in Donbas. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. I give the floor to the representative of Germany. I shall now make a further statement in my capacity as the representative of the Russian Federation. I wanted to say, by way of conclusion, that we did not launch an aggression against the Ukrainian people, but against the junta that is in power in Kyiv. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. There are no more names inscribed on the list of speakers. ","I thank the Secretary-General and Under-Secretary- General DiCarlo for their remarks. We are here tonight to call on Russia to avert war. For months, Russia has been holding a gun to Ukraine’s head. Now, President Putin’s finger is on the trigger. A full-scale conflict in a country of 44 million people will bring immense suffering, casualties on both sides and devastating humanitarian consequences. The members of the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Secretary-General have all called this week for respect for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The world is calling for peace, but Russia is not listening. Make no mistake, the United Kingdom will not compromise. We will not compromise our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity or our support for peace, prosperity, and the democratic freedom of the people of Ukraine. We will not compromise our commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter — above all the founding principle of the United Nations, that we “live together in peace with one another as good neighbours”. Russia’s actions are an assault on the Charter. And we will not compromise our commitment to a search for peace. We are here for the second time this week in the Council. My Prime Minister and Foreign and Defence Secretaries have been unsparing in their diplomatic efforts. But we have also announced a significant further sanction step against Russia, with our allies — a package targeted against some of the Russian oligarchs, banks, and politicians supporting President Putin. And we will ratchet up economic consequences should Russia continue its aggression. There is still time for restraint, reason and de-escalation. But that time is now. As we sat in the Security Council Chamber urging Russia to step back, President Putin announced special military operations on Ukrainian territory. This is unprovoked andunjustified. This is a grave day for Ukraine and for the principles of the United Nations. We and our partners have been clear that there will be consequences for Russia’s actions. We fully support the call of the United States for a Security Council resolution. The Council must do all it can to stop the war and uphold the Charter of the United Nations. ","I thank the Secretary-General for his strong stance and powerful remarks today before the General Assembly (see A/76/PV.58) and for his remarks tonight. A few moments ago, I spoke to President Biden, who asked me to convey in the strongest possible terms his and our steadfast support for Ukraine and for the urgent meeting the Security Council has convened tonight. Furthermore, he asked me to share that the United States and its allies and partners will continue to respond to Russia’s actions with unity, clarity and conviction. We are here tonight because we believe, along with Ukraine, that a full-scale, further invasion into Ukraine by Russia is imminent. Tonight, we are seeing the Russians close airspace, move troops into Donbas and move forces into combat-ready positions. This is a perilous moment. And we are here for one reason and one reason only — to ask Russia to stop, return to its borders, send its troops, tanks and planes back to their barracks and hangars, and send its diplomats to the negotiating table. It should back away from the brink before it is too late. Last week, the United States informed the Security Council and the world (see S/PV.8968) about what we expected to see unfold. We said that Russia would manufacture a pretext for an attack. We have since seen numerous false-flag events staged along the lines of contact in Donbas. We said Russia would theatrically convene emergency meetings at the highest levels of the Russian Government. We all saw that on Monday, with the State-televised Russian Security Council meeting held by President Putin — an orchestrated moment in which the Russian Government decided to recognize as “independent States” sovereign territory of Ukraine controlled by Russia’s proxies since 2014. Russia literally violated Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity on live television before the world. We said that false proclamations would come declaring that Russia would need to defend Russian- speakers in Ukraine. We got that and much more from President Putin’s speech on Monday and during the speech of the Russian Ambassador before the General Assembly today. No one could have predicted just how dangerous, inciting and far-reaching President Putin’s speech would be, with Putin arguing for taking the world back in time to an era of empires and colonies. Finally, we said the attack would come next and that we could expect communications to be jammed and cyberattacks to shut down key Ukrainian institutions. Last week, we attributed to Russia denial-of-service attacks against Ukrainian banks, and we saw similar activity this morning, targeting Government sites as well. And, in the last few hours, we have received very concerning reports of destructive malware placed on hundreds of computers and executed on at least some. After that, we said, would come the bombs, the missiles, the soldiers and the tanks. Already, soldiers have been deployed to the occupied region of Ukraine. We are here tonight because we believe the rest is imminent. Now, over the past few weeks, Russia has called our predictions hysterical. Russia has said that we were lying. Russia has said that we were supplying the world with misinformation. Russia’s diplomats have even laughed in the face of the human suffering that we were sounding the alarm about, but what we said would happen has come to pass for all the world to see. Let us therefore be clear. Not all parties are culpable here. Calling for both sides to de-escalate only gives Russia a pass. Russia is the aggressor here. Russia’s attack on Ukraine is tantamount to an attack on the United Nations and every Member State in the Chamber tonight. The Security Council is charged with adjudicating threats to peace and security. Russia is bypassing it entirely and taking matters into its own hands. That undermines the institution and everyone who participates in it. The United States, Ukraine, its allies and partners across Europe, United Nations officials and every other member of the Security Council have all repeatedly implored Russia to engage at the diplomatic table. Instead, tonight Russia has brought its people, the Ukrainian people and the world to the brink of a conflict that will produce an untold amount of human suffering. I said it in the General Assembly this morning (see A/76/PV.58), and I will say it again tonight — every day, Russians should be asking themselves right now how many Russian lives Putin will sacrifice for his cynical ambitions. Responsible members of the Security Council will stand together, and we will stand with Ukraine. We will do so despite a reckless, irresponsible permanent member of the Security Council abusing its powers to attack its neighbour and subvert the United Nations and our international system. This morning, in the General Assembly, we saw dozens of leaders from across the globe stand up to defend the Charter of the United Nations and Ukraine against Russia’s brazen attacks. We were proud to stand with them. Today I had the opportunity to meet with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba. Many of those gathered here now were in the General Assembly Hall this morning when Foreign Minister Kuleba received enthusiastic and overwhelming applause after his remarks. Since he could not be here this evening, I would like to conclude by echoing his words. This morning he warned us all that: “no one will be able to sit out this crisis if Putin decides that he can move forward with his aggression against Ukraine. Your Governments and your people will face painful consequences together with our Government and our people.” (A/76/PV.58) He is right. History tells us that, and we must confront this threat head on — in the Council, in the United Nations and in our capitals. The people of Ukraine are counting on us. Let us not let them down. In my remarks tonight, I said that we predicted Russia’s false flag attacks — the misinformation, the theatrical emergency meetings and the cyberattacks. But one piece had not come to pass. Unfortunately, while we have been meeting in the Security Council tonight, it appears that President Putin has ordered that last step. At the exact time that we are gathered in the Council seeking peace, Putin delivered a message of war, in total disdain for the responsibility of the Council. This is a grave emergency. The Council will need to act, and we will put a draft resolution on the table tomorrow. As President Biden said tonight, “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable. ","This is the fourth time that the Security Council is meeting on Ukraine in a matter of weeks. Every time we meet, the reality on the ground confirms bit by bit what some of us have been anticipating. Russia has been saying one thing and doing the opposite. We were told that troops were retreating when their number has only increased. We were told to stop the hysteria since troops were in Russian territory. That is no longer the case. They are invading a neighbour, unprovoked with false pretexts, false narratives and fabricated news.Every development that has unfolded in the past 48 hours confirms to us and the world that Russia’s concerns have nothing to do with its security, that its anxieties are not linked to NATO expansion and that this issue is not a confrontation between Russia and the West. This is a confrontation between Russia and international law and the Charter of the United Nations that it deliberately has chosen to ignore — a confrontation between a hegemonistic vision and a rules-based world order.It is not about Russia’s concerns; it is about Russia’s appetite. The Ukrainians are facing another aggression just because they dare to exist, because they have chosen to be independent and because they have opted for democracy.This is a dark hour not only for Ukraine, but for the entire international community, as we witness with trepidation the progression of a pure act of aggression, carefully planned and cold-bloodedly executed. We called and hoped for a backdown of the Russian Federation from this senseless destructive and self-destructive action. We repeat the same call on Russia to stop, to reflect, to reverse its illegal decisions, to withdraw from this senseless madness, to de-escalate and not to push on towards the precipice. Several mechanisms are in place and various proposals have been made, including by President Zelensky, whose calls remain unanswered. Diplomacy is like hope. It dies last, but, if it is to work, it must be seized, not ignored, as the Secretary-General said earlier.We call on our fellow members of the Security Council to rally in support of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Russia has been warned repeatedly that it will be alone in this foolishness and that it will be responsible for the innocent lives lost, including possibly Russian lives, and for the destruction caused in the heart of Europe in the twenty-first century.If they choose to continue to execute their plans, as every indication points to, they will bear not only the consequences of the war, but also the historical blame and shame of invading a neighbouring country, when its responsibility as a big country and a permanent member of the Security Council calls for it to work and help preserve peace and security, not torpedo it.We reiterate our support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, within its internationally recognized borders and territorial waters.In conclusion, I welcome the presence of the Permanent Representative of Ukraine at this meeting. I would like to convey to him and the Ukrainian Government and people that, at this most critical moment of their history, they are not alone, and we stand firm and in full solidarity with them for their right to be free and chose who they want to be. We could not end this meeting without noting that we had feared and anticipated for days is happening. Explosions are reported in Kyiv and several other cities in Ukraine. The masks have finally been taken off and tanks are in. As we speak, Russia is implementing its plan and attacking a neighbour, to whom it has decided to deny existence, freedom, land, dignity and life.We call on all the Members of the United Nations to rally in support of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, to stand with Ukraine and its people, to condemn firmly and unequivocally this aggression, to stand for peace, rules and international law and to take whatever measures they deem necessary to show the aggressor that its actions will bear consequences.Let me reiterate — Russia will be held responsible for the consequences of an unprovoked war entailing the loss of human rights, for causing unbearable human pain and for opting for destruction when we need development, for bringing death where we are in desperate need for hope, for choosing to become an outlaw when we need cooperation. Russia will bear historical shame and blame and the consequences of invading a neighbouring country and attempting to destroy European security.Let us unite and make sure that it will not succeed.","I would like to thank the Secretary-General and Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo for their very sobering remarks at the beginning of the meeting.Tonight, as we gather at this table, we are staring into the abyss of a major conflict in Europe — a conflict that would have major global implications. Tonight, the core principles of the United Nations in which we believe are under attack.In Ireland, we know the importance of the rules-based international order. We know the importance of respecting the voice and integrity of all countries, big or small. Most fundamentally, we know the value of peace. We believe that one State threatening and using lethal force against another to get its way or to expand its territory is no solution. Ireland has a deep understanding, informed by our history, that dialogue and respect resolve disputes. Tonight, that drives our solidarity with Ukraine. It is our collective responsibility — indeed, our obligation — here at this table to maintain international peace and security, nothing less. That means we stand up for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every State Member of the United Nations.Let us be clear — the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine have not changed. The decision of Russia to recognize as independent entities the non-Government-controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine does not change those borders one iota. They did not change in 2014 and they have not changed this week. We urge the Russian Federation to reverse that decision immediately.We urge the Russian Federation to refrain from further escalatory, unilateral actions that can serve only to further deepen the crisis. Tonight, the path of diplomacy and dialogue that we have called for for so long is perilously narrow. The principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which we hold dear, have already been breached. Those principles now risk being further violated.Now is the time to show courage, to pull back from the precipice and to return to dialogue and diplomacy. The use of military aggression has no place in our modern world. Have we learned nothing from our history? The United Nations rose from the ashes of two World Wars. The senseless destruction of that era was born of the belief that military might makes right. That philosophy, applied with modern weaponry, would unleash devastation and human suffering, affecting millions of innocent people.Tonight, we stand with the people of Ukraine. Tonight, we stand with the Charter of the United Nations. We stand with those who, even in this dark hour, still have the courage and hope to bring us back from the precipice. A resort to military conquest — for one State to impose its will unilaterally against another and to annex parts of its territory — has absolutely no place in the twenty-first century.There is still a choice — a choice to turn from the path of war to the path of diplomacy and dialogue. It is never too late to make the right choice. When I spoke earlier, I said that the path towards diplomacy and dialogue was perilously narrow. I did not realize, in fact, how narrow and how close to the precipice we really were just over an hour ago. We now see that that path has been closed by the announcement of a military aggression on the part of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. That is something we roundly condemn.We stand with the people of Ukraine tonight; with every man, woman and child seeing this news — as we did, sat here in the Chamber — whose lives are at risk.We believe that it is now time indeed for the Council to stand up, to assume its responsibility and to speak out in the strongest possible terms about that act of aggression.","I thank the Secretary-General and Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo for their important statements.We are facing the dire prospect of a major war in Europe. Norway strongly condemns the decision by President Putin to send Russian troops into the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and the latest announcement of a special military operation. Those decisions are unjustified, unprovoked and irresponsible. We call on Russia to reverse those decisions and to immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all its military forces from the territory of Ukraine and the vicinity of its internationally recognized borders.Our thoughts are with those who have already suffered too much owing to this conflict and with all those who are afraid that tomorrow will be a lot worse.We call upon all parties to strictly respect the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law, which call for the protection of civilians, including humanitarian personnel, and civilian infrastructure, and for the facilitation of safe, rapid and unhindered humanitarian access to those in need in Ukraine.As the Secretary-General clearly stated, the decision of the Russian Federation to recognize the so-called independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions are violations of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and are inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.Let me recall the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, which are now under threat. The Charter applies to all nations, including Russia.Today in the General Assembly (see A/76/PV.58), Member States from all over the world strongly urged the parties to pursue negotiations towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict, with respect for international law and Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.Norway urges Russia, as a party to the Minsk agreements and to the conflict, to fulfil its commitments, to abide by international law and to return to the path of diplomacy. Russia has taken on a clear commitment to seek a peaceful settlement to this conflict and must honour it.We commend Ukraine’s posture of restraint in the face of continued provocations and destabilization efforts.Let me conclude by once again reiterating Norway’s unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.","Let me begin by thanking the Secretary-General for his briefing on the evolving situation in the eastern regions of Ukraine.The Security Council met two days ago and discussed the situation (see S/PV.8970). We called for the urgent de-escalation of tensions and emphasized the need for sustained and focused diplomacy to address all issues concerning the situation.However, we note with regret that the calls of the international community to give time to the recent initiatives undertaken by the parties to diffuse tensions were not heeded. The situation is in danger of spiralling into a major crisis. We express our deep concern over the developments, which, if not handled carefully, may well undermine the peace and security of the region.We call for immediate de-escalation and for refraining from any further action that could contribute to the worsening of the situation. We call on all parties to exert greater efforts to bridge divergent interests. I would like to underline that the legitimate security interests of all parties should be fully taken into account.India has consistently advocated at the United Nations the need for the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with international law and with agreements entered into by the parties concerned.I underline once again that more than 20,000 Indian nationals, including students, are located in different parts of Ukraine, including in its border areas. We are facilitating the return of all Indian nationals, including students, as may be required.We believe that the solution lies in sustained diplomatic dialogue between the concerned parties. In the meantime, we strongly emphasize the vital need for all sides to maintain international peace and security by exercising the utmost restraint.","My country thanks the Secretary-General for attending tonight’s meeting and for his appeal in the Chamber. We support that appeal.We also thank Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo for her briefing.Mexico deplores the fact that, despite the widespread call from the international community, tensions around Ukraine, instead of having diminished, have increased. That is why we are forced to meet here again tonight.Having ratified the Charter of the United Nations, all States have committed to respecting the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of States. As members of the Security Council, we have the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. That creates the obligation to ensure that the Security Council can discharge its mandate and ensure respect for the Charter of the United Nations.Mexico supports all statements of the Secretary-General and urges the parties to make use of the good offices that the Secretary-General has offered.The President of Mexico declared this morning that we cannot accept the invasion of one country by another, as it is contrary to international law. We recall once again that, some days ago, Russia made a forceful statement right here, before the international community, stressing that it would not invade Ukraine (see S/PV.8970). The recent announcement of a special military operation is at variance with that statement.An invasion would constitute an act of aggression, in line with General Assembly resolution 3314 (XXIX). We will not waver in our call for détente, diplomacy and dialogue. A diplomatic solution is the only way to avoid falling off the precipice, which would lead to a war in Europe.","Let me begin by first of all thanking the Secretary-General and Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo for their significant briefings.Ghana is grateful to the Secretary-General for his clear statements on the situation in Ukraine in defence of the Charter of the United Nations, the rules-based international order and our collective security mechanism. The developments that are taking place in Ukraine are indeed troubling. The situation has implications not only for Ukraine and its immediate neighbours but also for all our countries. Security is indivisible and the insecurity of one is the insecurity of all.As we indicated in our statement to the Security Council on Monday night (see S/PV.8970), Ghana deeply regrets the decision of the Russian Federation to naturally recognize the non-Government-controlled regions of Ukraine and to send troops into those regions. We are also deeply concerned by the implications of those decisions. We suggest that the Russian Federation has turned its back on the Minsk agreements and the path of dialogue required to address any concerns that we have over the implementation of the agreements and related security concerns. However, we read a report this morning — the statement attributed to the President of the Russian Federation — that his country was always open to diplomacy. We urge that that avowed commitment to diplomacy to which the Russian Federation alluded be backed by present actions that de-escalate the situation on the ground and permit an atmosphere for dialogue. We note with concern the risk that an escalation of the situation in Ukraine holds for global peace, and we stress that those that choose the path of conflict rather than peace bear the consequences of their actions.We are concerned by reports of the commencement of hybrid warfare against Ukraine, especially attempts of cyberattacks against some of its critical infrastructure. To de-escalate the situation, we urge the Russian Federation to reconsider any intentions to move troops into the eastern regions of Ukraine in response to the purported request by the leaders of the separatist regions for an intervention.By its nature, peacekeeping requires the consent of the parties and the impartiality of the peacekeeping force. The presence of the Russian troops in eastern Ukraine at this time would not fulfil those requirements. If there is a real need, the Security Council should be seized of the matter.We urge calm and call upon all parties to maintain the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine. We are particularly concerned by the high intensity of violations of the ceasefire in recent days and their consequences for the civilian populations in the Donbas region. We remind all parties of the need to respect international law and international humanitarian law and urge the parties to guarantee unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance in both Government- and non-Government-controlled areas. We condemn any military activity that would deliberately target civilians and civilian infrastructure and remind all parties of their personal responsibility that exists in international law.It may be begging the question but, nonetheless, worth repeating: Ghana unreservedly stands by the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, a bona fide Member of the United Nations, whose membership of the Organization provides for its guarantees over its internationally recognized borders — the same borders with which it joined the Organization. We are aware that the current developments in the eastern regions of Ukraine would not lead to a strategic gain for any party, and we encourage efforts to address both immediate and long-term interests through diplomacy and dialogue. As called for by the Preamble of the Charter of the United Nations, we remind all parties to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours,Finally, we take this opportunity to urge all Member States to exercise restraint with regard to the respective unsettled but accepted situations across the globe and to uphold the collective security mechanism established through the Charter of the United Nations. Any differences that exist in international relations must be adjusted by peaceful and legal means.","I would like to thank the Secretary-General and the Under-Secretary-General, Rosemary DiCarlo, for the information they have provided to the Security Council and the remarks they have made tonight.The reports received about the movement of troops into certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk in Ukraine are cause for extreme concern. The threat or use of force against the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of a State Member of the United Nations is unacceptable.In the present circumstances, the Security Council must act according to its main purpose as holder of the primary responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security. In the exercise of that responsibility, its actions must be geared towards a reduction in tensions and towards assisting parties in their negotiations. That is our primary role.The recourse to arms and confrontation cannot lead to lasting peace. In that regard, we call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint and to refrain from any action that may further increase tensions on the ground. The time is not for belligerent rhetoric or military threats but to engage truly in a diplomatic process. The means of negotiation have not been exhausted.Immediate de-escalation is of a high order. It means, among other things, the complete and unconditional withdrawal of all military forces as an effective measure for the prevention and removal of threats to peace. The parties must abide by the terms of the Minsk agreements, above all by their call for a comprehensive ceasefire. The Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe can assist if granted unrestrained access in order to verify, identify and report accordingly any violation of the ceasefire.Furthermore, the parties must allow the rapid, safe and unhindered access of humanitarian assistance to those in need. The protection of civilians, including humanitarian personnel and persons in vulnerable situations, must be respected unconditionally.We redouble our calls for the parties to work constructively in all relevant instances, such as the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group. Negotiations must be mindful of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, including the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of its Member States.Negotiations must also, on the one hand, take into account the security concerns of all parties to the conflict and, on the other, aim to create adequate conditions for an inclusive political dialogue that must reflect the diversity of and include representation from all the peoples of the region.Brazil does not underestimate the complexity of the current situation, but we insist on dialogue as key to achieving a lasting settlement to this conflict. Too much is at stake here, above all the lives of many civilians. We owe them all our efforts to bring this crisis to a peaceful solution.","I thank the Secretary-General for his urgent plea for peace and Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo for her briefing.In this grave moment, Kenya continues to call for respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of Ukraine, in line with the core tenets of the Charter of the United Nations. Kenya is deeply concerned by the rapid escalation of the conflict risks following the recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent States by the Russian Federation and the continued military escalation. We are concerned that there is a serious risk that a conflict enveloping the whole of the Donbas region will occur, present trends holding. Such a development would instantly lead to significant loss of life, a humanitarian crisis and a large-scale population movement of refugees and internally displaced people.Kenya urgently calls for calm by all parties and for their commitment to protecting civilians and civilian objects from any actions contrary to international law and international humanitarian law. We continue to believe that there is still an opportunity for diplomacy to produce a solution to this dangerous crisis. The required diplomatic steps should seek, in the short term, for a de-escalation of the situation and the limiting of all military manoeuvres to prevent sparking a wider conflict. For that to happen, there must also be a stated commitment to negotiations between NATO and the Russian Federation in the middle and long terms. Such a commitment will need the vision to design a viable security architecture for Europe that protects the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of Ukraine and other States, while being sensitive to the concerns of all the relevant parties.We want to believe that this Chamber, in the light of its storied past, retains the wisdom and wherewithal to prevent a catastrophic war. We have confidence that the United Nations Charter, embraced as a whole, protects Ukraine and all countries, not only those with modest military means, but also the world’s nuclear Powers. When we consider the recent past of wars undertaken by choice and when the Charter and international law were breached, eventually the safety and security of all parties were tragically undermined.The membership of this Chamber was fundamentally shaped by the States that emerged victorious from the Second World War. In doing so, the Charter bestowed on them a special responsibility that reflected the sacrifices that they had made to defeat a unique evil to humankind. We believe that the leaders who designed today’s multilateral system were profoundly humbled by the catastrophic war that they had survived, so much so that they were inspired to erect the sovereign equality of States as a central pillar of our United Nations. As such, we urge all Members to recall the ruin from war that has been experienced by most States sitting around this table. It is in this moment of peril that we can powerfully pivot to recommit to the Charter that our predecessors bequeathed us. A large part of that recommitment would be aided by our listening to the Secretary-General and utilizing his good offices to deliver according to their intended design.In the coming days, we hope that we will observe a de-escalation in Donbas and that every effort will be made to protect the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of Ukraine. We further hope that we will benefit from the visionary leadership that the world needs today in committing to negotiating a lasting European security architecture that lowers perceptions of threat and promotes cooperation.","At the outset, I would like to thank the Secretary-General and the Under Secretary-General for their briefings.This is the fourth Security Council meeting to be held on the situation in Ukraine in less than a month. In light of the recent worrying tensions, my country has taken a position calling for de-escalation and for efforts to find a peaceful solution to the current crisis.In that context, we would like to highlight the following points.First, we reaffirm the need to engage in dialogue in good faith, while intensifying diplomatic efforts at all levels to support opportunities for peace on the basis of international law. We reiterate that the Minsk agreements still constitute a good basis for reaching a peaceful solution to the crisis and maintaining regional and international security and stability.Secondly, we stress the importance of adhering to the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, particularly in settling international disputes through peaceful means and respecting the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of States. Adherence to those principles and compliance with the Charter of the United Nations constitute a central pillar in finding a sustainable and peaceful solution to the current crisisThirdly, we reiterate that the tense situation in eastern Ukraine could exacerbate the critical conditions for civilians. Furthermore, there are still obstacles to the delivery of humanitarian assistance to some of those in need, which existed even before the recent tensions arose, particularly in the areas near the contact line in eastern Ukraine.Any further escalation could worsen the humanitarian situation for a larger number of civilians. We therefore emphasize the importance of de-escalation and a ceasefire. In that regard, we urge all parties not to obstruct access to humanitarian aid or the movement of civilians in conflict areas, in accordance with their obligations under international law.In conclusion, my country reiterates the importance of de-escalation, constructive dialogue and continued efforts to reach peaceful solutions that are consistent with international law and the Charter of the United Nations.","I thank the Secretary-General for his statement, as well as Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo for her briefing.This is the fourth time in three weeks that the Council is meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. We meet tonight, 48 hours after our last meeting (see S/PV.8970) on the subject, because the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of Ukraine have been violated. We meet tonight because the lives of countless men, women and children are at the mercy of the murderous violence and clashes in eastern Ukraine. That has resulted in a mass exodus that imperils their dignity and safety. We meet tonight because, once again, the spectre of a war with dire consequences hangs over an entire region and we fear an imminent invasion of Ukraine.As we reject this attack on the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations, we must be compelled to go further and ensure respect for all provisions of the Charter and that the international community focuses its attention, with the same commitment and fervour, on all situations in all regions of the world where the security and dignity of peoples are under threat. Russia’s decision to recognize the sovereignty of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics is heavy with consequence for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. It jeopardizes the relevance and implementation of the Minsk agreements and heightens the recurring fears of imminent military action in Ukraine.My country remains firmly attached to respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each State. Strict respect for those cardinal principles, enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Constitutive Act of the African Union, is the glue of our social contract, as members of the international community. We remain convinced that the intense diplomatic activity and the various political measures adopted in recent weeks will allow for dialogue to be prioritized over confrontation and help prevent irreparable damage.Eight years ago, in a construct similar to that which brings us together today, 52 States Members of the United Nations abstained in the voting on General Assembly resolution 68/262, while the same fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter that bring us together today and on which we rely were violated. Their refusal to join the consensus, above and beyond the pressure to which their delegations were subjected in New York, as well as in capitals at the time, not too long ago, translates to a lack of understanding and, perhaps, apathy on the part of several members of the international community concerning the persistence of zones of influence we thought had ended in the post-colonization era and following the fall of the Berlin Wall. Regrettably, that harsh reality stubbornly persists in several regions of the world, in particular in Africa, Asia, America and, today, in Europe.The Council must ensure respect for the basic principles of the Charter of the United Nations, in particular the peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for the territorial integrity of States and national sovereignty. My country calls for an immediate ceasefire and de-escalation, as well as a sense of responsibility, by prioritizing the peaceful settlement of conflicts, in line with the United Nations Charter. We urge the parties to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure and refrain from all actions that could hinder the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need.In conclusion, I reaffirm my country’s attachment to an international order based on rules and not on the law of survival of the fittest. We call on all parties not to break the dialogue and to take every opportunity available to restore peace in Ukraine.","Before I try to deliver parts of the statement that I brought here tonight — most of which has already become useless since 10 p.m. New York time — I would like to cite Article 4, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations, which states:“Membership in the United Nations is open to all other peace-loving states which accept the obligations contained in the present Charter and, in the judgment of the Organization, are able and willing to carry out these obligations.”Russia is not able to carry out any of those obligations. Three minutes ago, the Ambassador of the Russian Federation confirmed that his President has declared war on my country.Therefore, before I read out parts of my statement, I would like to avail myself of the presence of the Secretary-General and request that he distribute among the members of the Security Council and the General Assembly the legal memos by the United Nations Legal Counsel, dated December 1991, and in particular the legal memo dated 19 December 1991, which we had been trying to get from the Secretariat for a very long time and were denied.Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Charter states,“The admission of any such state to membership in the United Nations will be effected by a decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.”I ask the Secretary-General to kindly instruct the Secretariat to distribute among the members of the Security Council and the General Assembly the decision of the Security Council, dated December 1991, recommending membership of the Russian Federation to the Organization, as well as the decision of the General Assembly, dated December 1991, in which the General Assembly welcomes the Russian Federation to the United Nations.It would be a miracle if the Secretariat were able to produce such decisions. There is nothing in the Charter of the United Nations about continuity as a sneaky way to get into the Organization.As I was on my way here about an hour ago, my intention was to ask the Russian Ambassador to confirm, on the record, that the Russian troops would not start firing on Ukrainians today or go ahead with the offensive. That became useless 48 minutes ago because, about 48 minutes ago, his President declared war on Ukraine. I would therefore like to ask the Ambassador of the Russian Federation to say on the record that, at this very moment, his troops are not shelling and bombing Ukrainian cities and are not moving into the territory of Ukraine. He has a smartphone; he can call Mr. Lavrov right now. We can pause to let him go out and call him.If he is not in a position to give an affirmative answer, the Russian Federation should relinquish its responsibilities as President of the Security Council and pass those responsibilities to a legitimate member of Security Council that respects the Charter. I ask the members of the Security Council to convene an emergency meeting immediately to consider all necessary draft decisions to stop the war. It is too late to speak about the escalation — too late. The Russian President has officially declared war. Should I play the video of President Putin?Shall I do that right now so that you can confirm it, Mr. President? Do not interrupt me, please. Russia declared war. It is the responsibility of this organ to stop the war. I therefore call on everyone here to do everything possible to stop the war. Or should I play the video with the President of Russia declaring war? As I said, Sir, relinquish your duties as President of the Council; call President Putin and call Foreign Minister Lavrov to stop the aggression.I welcome the decision of some members of the Council to meet as soon as possible to consider the necessary decision that would condemn the aggression that the Russian Federation has launched against my people.There is no purgatory for war criminals; they go straight to hell.","We meet at the very moment of a military escalation the likes of which we have not experienced in Europe for over a generation. The President of the Russian Federation announced a military operation on Ukrainian territory. We condemn it in the strongest terms, and we call upon all members of the Security Council and the United Nations to now stand up for Ukraine and against a shameless breach of international law.Two days ago, Russia’s decision to recognize the self-proclaimed People’s Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk was harshly rejected in the Council (see S/PV.8970). It had already dealt a devastating blow to the principles of international order that the United Nations stands for.Russia has not listened and, it turns out, was not prepared to listen. It has continued its massive military build-up, and we have been observing cyberattacks against Ukraine. Now the Russian military is moving into Ukrainian territory. Through those actions and this unprovoked military operation, Russia is violating the core principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We condemn the use of force against innocent people and the violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms. We urge Russia to terminate its military action against Ukraine immediately and withdraw its troops.Our thoughts are with the Ukrainian people. We will be steadfast in our support for Ukraine and our support for the United Nations Charter. This Russian aggression will have an unprecedented cost — politically, economically and morally.France, Ukraine and my country stood ready for diplomacy via another meeting in the Normandy format or a summit proposed by Ukraine. With our allies and partners, we called on Russia — in vain — to seek a diplomatic way forward. Now is the moment to jointly and decisively speak up and defend the international order of the United Nations Charter against unilateral aggression. Tonight we stand with Ukraine, unwavering and determined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S/PV.8970,21/02/2022,"Russia's recognition of the separatist ""republics"" in the East of Ukraine","China has paid close attention to the most recent developments of the situation in Ukraine. We fully elaborated on our position at the previous two meetings of the Council on this topic (see S/PV.8726 and S/PV.8968). At present, all parties concerned must exercise restraint and avoid any action that may fuel tensions. We welcome and encourage every effort for a diplomatic solution and call on all parties concerned to pursue dialogue and consultation and seek reasonable solutions to address each other’s concerns, on the basis of equality and mutual respect. The current situation in Ukraine is the result of several complex factors. China always adopts its own position based on the merits of the matter in question. We believe that all countries should resolve international disputes by peaceful means, in line with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. ","I would like to thank the Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs for her briefing. I would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his action and very clear words. I welcome the presence of the representative of Ukraine, whose request for an emergency meeting France supported, given the extreme gravity of the situation. France condemns Russia’s recognition of the separatist eastern regions of Ukraine. This is not just a further attack on the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, but it is also a violation of the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations, resolution 2202 (2015), which endorsed the Minsk agreements, and the commitments undertaken by Russia, confirmed at the very highest level these past few days. On 17 February (see S/PV.8968), the Russian representative publicly acknowledged before the Council that there is no alternative to the Minsk agreements and that they were the only internationally recognized legal basis to resolve the conflict in Ukraine. Today, however, the reality is quite different. Russia is choosing to challenge and confront in spite of continuous efforts over the past few weeks and days to de-escalate, notably by President Macron working with the German Chancellor. We are continuing those efforts. We call on Russia to match its words with its deeds, as it claims to be in favour of dialogue, and to reverse its decision to recognize the separatist entities. We are preparing targeted sanctions with our European partners against those who took part in that illegal decision. In the context of the heightened tensions on Ukraine’s borders, provoked by the Russian military build-up, we are concerned by Russia’s additional destabilizing step and the threat it poses to European security. France welcomes Ukraine’s restraint in these difficult circumstances. We express our full solidarity with the people and the Government of Ukraine. We call on Russia to refrain from other destabilizing actions, in particular those that could undermine the security and safety of civilian populations. We are concerned by President Putin’s decision to send the army to the separatist territories under the pretext of peacekeeping. That would be another flagrant violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity. France will continue to mobilize in support of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. ","In accordance with rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite the representatives of Germany and Ukraine to participate in this meeting. In accordance with rule 39 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, to participate in this meeting. The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. I now give the floor to Ms. DiCarlo. I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the Russian Federation. We have just heard several highly emotional statements, categorical assessments and far-reaching conclusions related to the signing today by Russia’s President of decrees recognizing People’s Republics of Luhansk and Donetsk. I will ignore the direct verbal assaults against us. It is now important to focus on preventing war and forcing Ukraine to stop the shelling and provocations against Donetsk and Luhansk. From the statements made by several of our colleagues, anyone would believe that Russia’s recognition of the People’s Republics of Luhansk and Donetsk took place suddenly, for no reason at all. Of course, that is not the case. It should be recalled that those Republics declared their independence from Ukraine in 2014. We only recognize them now, despite the high level of support for doing so, both in the Republics themselves and in Russian society from the very beginning. At the time, the hope was that Ukrainian Maidan regime would reconsider and stop talking to their own citizens in the east in the language of cannons, gunfire, shelling and threats. Time and again, we firmly requested Kyiv to listen to the aspirations of the people living in Donbas and to the Russian-speaking residents of the country and respect their entirely legitimate desire to use their mother tongue and teach their children in that language. We also asked Kyiv to honour the memory of those who liberated the land from fascists, instead of those who fought on the side of fascists and contributed to the killing of hundreds of thousands of people during the Second World War. After the Ukrainian military adventures foundered upon the resolve of the Donbas and Luhansk people to defend their land, the Minsk agreements were signed and the package of measures was adopted to implement them. There was once again hope for peace and the prudence of the Maidan authorities, which had burnt themselves on their desire to drown Donetsk and Luhansk in blood. In particular, much hope was placed in the 2019 election of the new president of Ukraine, who promised to finally establish peace in Donbass. However, those who counted on the peace-loving attitude of the Ukrainian Government were unfortunately mistaken. Kyiv not only quickly returned to its bellicose rhetoric and continued to shell peaceful civilians, but it also did everything it could to sabotage and ultimately undermine the Minsk agreements. Most important is Kyiv’s stubborn refusal to speak directly with the representatives of Donetsk and Luhansk, despite the fact that that requirement is a central structural element of the package of measures. We have heard the unequivocal confirmation of their unwillingness to engage in such dialogue more than once from Ukrainian leaders in recent days, including from the Permanent Representative of Ukraine at the Security Council meeting we convened on 17 February on the implementation of the Minsk agreements (see S/PV.8968). After that, it became clear once and for all that Ukraine does not intend to implement the Minsk agreements. I want to remind my colleagues on the Security Council that in all other conflicts, be they in Libya, Syria or Yemen, we demand and call for direct dialogue between the parties to the conflict, and only Ukraine is somehow an exception to the rule. One might draw the conclusion from some of the statements today that a number of our colleagues are ready to bury the Minsk agreements. However, I would like to remind members that, at the time when the Minsk agreements were signed, the Luhansk People’s Republic and Donetsk People’s Republic had already declared their independence. The fact that Russia recognized that today in no way changes the make-up of the parties to the Minsk agreements, as Russia is not a party to them. We have repeatedly stated that and, in that regard, nothing has changed. It is another matter that the Minsk agreements, some of the provisions of which should have been implemented back in 2015, have long been openly sabotaged by Ukraine, with the patronage of our Western colleagues. Currently, we see that many of our colleagues want to sign off to the idea that the Minsk agreements are dead, but they are not. Kyiv remains obligated to implement them. We remain open to a diplomatic solution, but will not allow a renewed bloodbath in Donbas. Unfortunately, we are compelled to note the extremely negative role played in all this by our Western colleagues, led by the United States of America. Instead of forcing Kyiv to fulfil its commitments, they have only openly incited Ukraine, repeating the empty mantra that Russia is not fulfilling its obligations under the Minsk agreements, which, as we have repeatedly stressed, is not even party to them. Moreover, for several weeks, while stoking groundless panic about Russia’s supposedly imminent invasion of Ukraine, our Western colleagues have been shamelessly foisting weapons upon the country and sending trainers there, thereby effectively pushing the Ukrainians, who have deployed a 120,000-strong military contingent along the contact line, to engage in armed provocations against Donbas. The bubble inflated by the combined efforts of the West and Ukraine could not help but burst. Over the weekend, the intensity of Ukrainian shelling of residential areas in the Luhansk People’s Republic and Donetsk People’s Republic increased sharply. Reportedly, up to 1,600 projectiles were launched, killing civilians. Several subversive groups penetrated into the territory of the Republics, who have carried out or attempted to sabotage critical infrastructure. As I mentioned, there have been civilian casualties. General mobilization has been announced in the Luhansk People’s Republic and Donetsk People’s Republic. Refugees have poured into Russia, not Ukraine, over the past several days, amounting to approximately 70,000 women, elderly people and children. Russian is hosting them and providing them with shelter and support. Towns in Russian territory close to the border area were even shelled. It has therefore become clear that Donbas is on the verge of a new Ukrainian military adventure, as it already was in 2014 and 2015. We cannot allow that to happen. That is why the President of Russia listened to the opinion of parliamentarians and members of the Russian Security Council. Everyone knows the rest. The detailed statement by our Head of State on the reasons for the decision adopted was broadcast by the world’s leading media. However, today we have heard an open distortion of what the President said in his statement about history and genesis of this crisis and the assertion that that he allegedly would like to rebuild the Russian Empire. I call on our Western colleagues to come to their senses, set aside their emotions and not make the situation worse. No one other than them will be able to restrain Kyiv’s militaristic plans and force it to stop shelling and provocations against the Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, which in the new circumstances could have particularly dangerous consequences. In accordance with the agreements signed with them today and on the basis of their appeals, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will perform the functions of maintaining peace on the territories of the Luhansk People’s Republic and the Donetsk People’s Republic. In conclusion, I should like to note that, in today’s statements, most of my colleagues failed to mention the more than 4 million residents of Donbas. They seem to have omitted their fates from their statements since 2014, contemptuously calling them pro-Russian separatists. However, they are guilty only of wanting to talk with the authorities that came to power following the illegal Maidan coup in 2014 and to discuss how their rights would be upheld. Over the past few days, with the intensification in military activity of the Ukrainian army along the contact line, the lives of hundreds of thousands of women, children and elderly people, as in 2014 and 2015, have once again ended up under real threat. The main goal of our decision was to protect and save those lives, which are more important than everyone’s threats. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. ","We meet this evening because, earlier today, President Putin announced the Russian Federation’s recognition of the independence of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic, and issued a decree to send Russian military forces into Ukraine as so-called peacekeepers. The actions Russia has chosen today will have severe and far-reaching consequences. First, there will be consequences for human life. An invasion of Ukraine unleashes the forces of war, death and destruction on the people of Ukraine. The humanitarian impact will be terrible on civilians fleeing the fighting. We know that women and children will suffer most. Secondly, there will be consequences for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a United Nations Member State, which is protected and guaranteed by the Charter of the United Nations. As the Secretary- General said earlier, Russia’s decisions are a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter. Thirdly, there will be consequences for international law. The actions taken today make a mockery of the commitments Russia has made through the Budapest Memorandum and the Minsk agreements, endorsed by resolution 2202 (2015). In seeking to redraw borders by force, Russia’s actions show blatant contempt for international law. The United Kingdom will be announcing new sanctions on Russia in response to its breach of international law and attack on Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. There will be severe economic consequences for its actions. Now more than ever, the Council must shoulder its responsibilities for peace and security and defend the principles of the Charter. The Council must be united in calling on Russia to de-escalate immediately, in condemning aggression against a sovereign nation and defending the territorial integrity of Ukraine, and in calling on Russia to respect its obligations under the Charter to the peaceful resolution of disputes. Russia has brought us to the brink. We urge Russia to step back. ","Since the Second World War, the Charter of the United Nations Charter — the key tenets of which the Council is mandated to uphold — has stood as a bulwark to the worst impulses of empires and autocrats. Earlier today, Russia’s President, Vladimir Putin, announced that Russia will recognize as “independent States” the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic, the sovereign territory of Ukraine, an area controlled by Russia’s proxies since 2014. He has since announced that he will place Russian troops in these regions. He calls them peacekeepers. This is nonsense. We know what they really are. In doing so, he has put before the world a choice. We must meet the moment and we must not look away. History tells us that looking the other way in the face of such hostility will be a far more costly path. Russia’s clear attack on Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is unprovoked. It is an attack on Ukraine’s status as a United Nations Member State. It violates a basic principle of international law. And it defies our Charter. What is more, this move by President Putin is clearly the basis for Russia’s attempt to create a pretext for a further invasion of Ukraine. The consequences of this action will be felt far beyond Ukraine’s borders. We do not have to guess at President Putin’s motives. Today President Putin made a series of outrageous, false claims about Ukraine, aimed at creating a pretext for war, and immediately thereafter announced that Russian troops were entering the Donbas. He claimed that Ukraine is seeking nuclear weapons from the West. This is not true. Ukraine is in fact one of only four countries to have voluntarily surrendered their nuclear weapons. The United States and our allies have no intention of supplying nuclear weapons to Ukraine, and Ukraine does not want them. And then, President Putin asserted that Russia today has a rightful claim to all territories — all territories — from the Russian Empire; the same Russian Empire from before the Soviet Union, from over 100 years ago. That includes all of Ukraine. It includes Finland. It includes Belarus and Georgia and Moldova; Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan; Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Lithuania; Latvia, and Estonia. It includes parts of Poland and Turkey. In essence, Putin wants the world to travel back in time — to a time before the United Nations; to a time when empires ruled the world. But the rest of the world has moved forward. It is not 1919. It is 2022. The United Nations was founded on the principle of decolonization, not recolonization. And we believe that the vast majority of United Nations Member States and Security Council are committed to moving forward, not going back in time. The consequences of Russia’s actions will be dire — across Ukraine, across Europe and across the globe. In our past two meetings on Ukraine, I have mentioned that nearly 3 million Ukrainians need food, shelter and lifesaving assistance right now. The United Nations estimates that the humanitarian toll will expand significantly should Russia further invade. Already, Russian proxies dramatically increased shelling and artillery fire over the weekend, killing Ukrainian civilians and soldiers. If Russia invades Ukraine even further, we will see a devastating loss of life — unimaginable suffering. Millions of displaced people will create a refugee crisis across Europe. Nevertheless, Russia has declined repeated entreaties to state its intentions before the world, including by Secretary Blinken in the Security Council last Thursday (see S/PV.8968). President Putin is testing our international system; he is testing our resolve and seeing just how far he can push us all. He wants to demonstrate that through force, he can make a farce of the United Nations. We must act together in response to this crisis. Over the past few weeks, the world has heard the other 14 members of the Security Council speak with one voice, asking Russia to pursue diplomacy. Other members of the Council — even those that often align with Russia on other matters — have been clear that the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of every United Nations State Member, including Ukraine, should be respected and safeguarded, that this is a basic norm of international relations and that it embodies the purpose of the United Nations Charter. The sequence of events that Secretary Blinken spelled out for the Council last Thursday appears to be proceeding exactly as he predicted. Today President Putin has torn the Minsk agreements to shreds. We have been clear that we do not believe he will stop at that. In the light of President Putin’s latest actions, we must all stand up for the principles upon which the Organization was founded. President Biden issued an Executive Order today that will prohibit new investment, trade and financing in the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic regions. Tomorrow the United States will take further measures to hold Russia accountable for this clear violation of international law and Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, but we and our partners have been clear that there would be a swift and severe response were Russia to further invade Ukraine. In this moment, no one can stand on the sidelines. We must make it clear that an attack on Ukraine is an attack on the sovereignty of every United Nations Member State and the United Nations Charter, and that it will be met with swift and severe consequences. We continue to believe that the diplomatic table is the only place where responsible nations resolve their differences. That is the only place to preserve peace. ","I thank Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo for another clear and comprehensive briefing to the Security Council on this issue.Albania condemns, in the strongest terms, Russia’s decision to recognize non-Government-controlled areas of Ukraine as independent entities. This is a breach of international law, an affront to the Charter of the United Nations and another blatant violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and it puts an end the Minsk agreements.This act of the Russian Federation is null and void, has no basis and has no international legal validity. We call on the Security Council and all the United Nations States Members to reject and condemn it firmly. Albania reiterates its firm position in support of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.Less than a week ago, we were sitting in this very Chamber, at the Russian initiative, to discuss the implementation of the Minsk agreements (see S/PV.8968). Today we meet at an emergency meeting exactly because of the Russian Federation decision to violate the very Minsk agreements. This is disrespect not only of the Council and its decisions, but for the entire universal principles of international law Russia is set to respect and protect.The whole world has witnessed how the Russian Federation has continuously worked to undermine the sovereignty of Ukraine and to determine its geopolitical orientation. What happened today is nothing less but a bis repetita of what we saw in Georgia in 2008 and with Crimea in 2014 — aggression by fabrication of phantom republics. Who is next?Every United Nations Member State should be alarmed and realize, eyes wide open, the consequences of the instrumentalization of national minorities as a weapon to undermine sovereign States and threaten regional and international peace and security. We should not allow the “made in Russia” model of destabilization to be exported to other parts of Europe or anywhere else.We reiterate our demand for the removal of the military troops from the Ukrainian border and from the occupied territories of Ukraine, including troops disguised as peacekeepers when they are simply aggressors. Albania calls on the Russian Federation to stop its fait accompli policy, revoke this illegal decision and engage seriously and in good faith in diplomatic talks and to give a chance to the Minks agreements.This is yet another critical moment for Ukraine. The United Nations should remain actively engaged and committed, together with regional organizations, to the right of the Ukrainian people to live in peace and freedom.We welcome the statement of the Secretary-General and echo his call for all relevant actors to prioritize diplomacy to address all issues peacefully as the only way forward.","I, too, want to thank Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo for her briefing.We meet tonight at a moment of great danger for the people of Ukraine; for peace and security in Europe; and for the international norms and principles that all of us around this table have a responsibility to defend. It is a moment that we had hoped to avoid, a moment that should have been averted by diplomacy and dialogue. We must respond to it by speaking clearly and honestly about this grave situation and how we can resolve it peacefully.So let me be clear about where we stand: Ireland’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders is unwavering. Ireland believes in and is fully committed to the core principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. These include the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States. Ukraine has the same fundamental right as every other sovereign and independent State to choose its own foreign policy and to ensure the security and defence of its own territory. The commitments we make as Members of the United Nations are binding on every one of us — no exceptions.Last Thursday, during the meeting organized by the Russian Federation on the Minsk agreements (see S/PV.8968), we heard from Deputy Minister Vershinin that the goal of that meeting was for the Security Council to affirm that there was no alternative to that milestone document.We believe that the Council did just that. Yet now, four days later, President Putin has decided to recognize as independent entities the non-Government-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk and to order troops into those two regions of Ukraine. This is the second time in less than 10 years that the Russian Federation has violated Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. It is a flagrant violation of international law.In taking that unilateral step, Russia has abandoned the Minsk agreements and cast into doubt all the diplomatic efforts of past weeks. Ireland commends Ukraine for the restraint it has shown in the face of Russia’s military build-up at its border and the provocation of the recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.Ireland, along with our European Union partners, supports a clear and unequivocal response to this violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty. The Russian Federation’s unilateral actions serve only to further raise tensions. Ireland once again calls for calm, de-escalation and the pursuit of diplomacy. Even if that call has not yet been heard, it is a call worth making again tonight. We need to see sustained and credible moves on the ground towards the de-escalation of the crisis. We urge Russia to reverse the recognition, withdraw its military forces and return to discussions within the Normandy format.All signatories to the Minsk agreements agreed on the need for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission’s safe and secure access to the entire territory of Ukraine. The mandate of the Mission was agreed by all 57 OSCE participating States. At this sensitive time, it is imperative that the Mission be given the full access agreed in its mandate.We commend those who have engaged in dialogue and urge them to redouble their efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to this perilous situation. We owe nothing less to the people of Ukraine. We call on all parties to ensure the protection of civilians as well as to refrain from any actions that would escalate the situation.Ukraine has already endured eight years of bitter conflict, with more than 14,000 lives lost. The people of eastern Ukraine in particular have suffered from years of insecurity, humanitarian crisis and human rights violations and abuses. The Council and its members have the responsibility to work to resolve that conflict rather than yield to a grim new chapter that will inflict further misery on Ukraine and its people. This is the time to show the courage to pull back from the precipice and return to dialogue and diplomacy.We all need to demonstrate our faith in the value of diplomacy tonight.","Let me also thank Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo for her briefing and, through her, the Secretary-General for today’s press statement.We are gathered here this evening because of the Russian Federation’s violation of the core principle on which the Organization is built — the sovereign equality of all its Members. Norway strongly condemns the decision by the Russian President to recognize the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic, in eastern Ukraine, as independent States. The recognition of the self-proclaimed People’s Republics is a clear violation of the Minsk agreements, under which Russia recognizes the non-Government-controlled areas in eastern Ukraine as part of Ukraine.As a signatory of the Minsk agreements and as endorsed by resolution 2202 (2015), the Russian Federation has made a clear commitment to seeking a peaceful settlement to the conflict and recognition of the self-proclaimed People’s Republics runs directly contrary to the work of the Normandy format and Trilateral Contact Group towards a negotiated peace. Furthermore, Russia’s actions constitute a clear violation of international law. It has chosen unilateral action and military threats rather than diplomacy and dialogue. Norway urges Russia, as a party to the conflict, to fulfil its commitment, to abide by international law and to return to the path of diplomacy.Russia’s continued massive military build-up in and around Ukraine remains an issue of grave concern. Norway urges Russia to de-escalate by withdrawing its military forces from Ukraine and from the vicinity of its borders.We commend Ukraine’s posture of restraint in the face of continued provocation and destabilization efforts. Russia’s decision to deploy forces in eastern Ukraine is unjustified and irresponsible, as it further increases tensions. We face the prospect of a war that would not only threaten Europe’s security architecture, but also lead to unparalleled suffering for the civilian population. Norway calls on Russia to strictly respect and fully adhere to international humanitarian law. We call upon all parties to protect civilians, including humanitarian personnel and civilian infrastructure, and to facilitate safe, rapid and unhindered humanitarian access to those in need in Ukraine.Let me conclude by again reiterating Norway’s unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its recognized borders. Finally, let me recall the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which are now under threat by the actions of the Russian Federation in and around Ukraine.","Let me begin by thanking Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo for her briefing.We have been closely following the evolving developments related to Ukraine, including developments along its eastern border and the related announcement by the Russian Federation. The escalation of tension along Ukraine’s border with the Russian Federation is a matter of deep concern. Those developments have the potential to undermine the peace and security of the region.We call for restraint on all sides. The immediate priority is the de-escalation of tensions, taking into account the legitimate security interests of all countries and aimed at securing long-term peace and stability in the region and beyond.We are convinced that the issue can be resolved only through diplomatic dialogue. We need to give space to the recent initiatives undertaken by the parties that seek to diffuse tensions. In that context, we welcome the intense efforts under way, including through the Trilateral Contact Group and in the Normandy format. We need the parties to exert greater efforts to bridge divergent interests. We cannot afford to have a military escalation.As we have emphasized before, the Minsk agreements provide a basis for a negotiated and peaceful settlement. We need greater efforts to find common ground to facilitate the implementation of the provisions of the Minsk agreements, including their key security and political aspects. As we have time and again emphasized, constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour so as to avoid the scaling up of tensions.The safety and security of civilians are essential. More than 20,000 Indian students and nationals live and study in different parts of Ukraine, including in its border areas. The well-being of Indian nationals is of priority to us.In conclusion, we strongly emphasize the vital need for all sides to maintain international peace and security by exercising the utmost restraint and intensifying diplomatic efforts to ensure that a mutually amicable solution is arrived at as early as possible.","We are grateful to Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo for her briefing on the current situation in Ukraine.We are following with concern the recent developments in the situation in eastern Ukraine. In the current circumstances, it is critical that any actions exacerbating the crisis cease.Through resolution 2202 (2015), the Security Council endorsed the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements as the only framework for resolving the situation in eastern Ukraine. That resolution must be respected. Specifically, in this particular case, three fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations are being violated, namely, refraining from the threat or use of force in international relations, respect for the territorial integrity and political independence of States and non-interference in their internal affairs. It is therefore unacceptable that over the past few days the shelling, explosions and other ceasefire violations have increased, according to reports from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission. We urge the parties to immediately put an end to those actions.We wish to recall that in this same Chamber a few days ago Russia stated categorically that it would not invade Ukraine (see S/PV.8968). We hope that it will comply fully with that statement. Mexico reiterates its commitment to respect for the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, pursuant to the Charter of the United Nations, international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, particularly Assembly resolutions 2625 (XXV) and 3314 (XXIX).We once again reiterate our appeal to resume efforts to take the path of de-escalation, diplomacy and dialogue.","I will also begin by first of all thanking Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo for her briefing to the Security Council.The decision by the Russian Federation to recognize the non-Government-controlled regions of eastern Ukraine and to send in troops has stunned the world. Ghana deeply regrets the decision of the Russian Federation to turn its back on the Minsk agreements and the dialogue required to address concerns over the implementation of the agreements.When Ghana joined this Organization, in 1957, we were under no illusions that the international order was perfect. However, we were, and are still, convinced that the principle of the sovereign equality of States, which constitutes the basis of this Organization and our multilateral order, is the very type of foundation for a stable world. We believe that the United Nations represents the best attempt at maintaining peace across nations, forging relations and cooperation between and among our peoples and holding forth the prospect of a better tomorrow. It is for that reason that Ghana, like many other Members of the Organization, solemnly committed itself to upholding the Charter of the United Nations and international law. We believe that, through multilateralism, we can improve cooperation to make the world a better place for its citizens and for generations unborn.Through this Organization and our common actions on principles such as self-determination within the context of the United Nations, the countries that existed under colonial rule were assisted in becoming sovereign and politically independent States. By its sheer convening power, this Organization has set out a pathway for dialogue for all its Members, regardless of differences in political ideology, and encouraged the development and maintenance of friendly relations. Through the actions of this Organization, the rights of people across the world have become more respected by their Governments and their well-being has been better guaranteed.I will be clear: Ghana supports the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine, which joined the United Nations as a bona fide Member. We do not support any actions that violate Ukraine’s sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity. By its principles, Ghana does not recognize any entity outside the clear arrangements that have been established by the Charter and the principles of international law for the recognition of States.As an international community, we have pulled back from many dangerous scenarios when logic and reason have prevailed. On this occasion, we re-echo the voice of the coalition of peace for restraint by all parties. While the sound of war may be loud, the voice of peace runs deeper. We urge restraint on all unsettled but accepted situations across the globe and remind Member States of the need to protect the collective security mechanism, which requires adherence to the core principles of the Charter and international law.The true test of greatness lies not in one’s ability to use power but in the capacity to constrain its use when that would be an obvious choice by those of a lesser capacity. We hope that within the Security Council, and perhaps outside it too, we will find a resolution of the existing situation in Ukraine in a manner that does not impair the mechanisms for peace. While Ghana and other African Member States have always held that the use of the veto power is anachronistic and counterproductive to the effective workings of our modern arrangements for maintaining global peace and security, that concern has never been rendered more acute than in situations such as the one that we now see. Even though on many occasions it may be enough to say that we are against the actions of a Member State that go against the international norms, on this occasion we are all required to do more in reaffirming our common commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter. Besides the immediate cost of instability, all countries, including the most vulnerable in the developing world, may pay a steep price for actions that destabilize a part of Europe.As we note with great concern the reports of foreign troops being sent across the borders of Ukraine, we reiterate our continuing concern about the situation of the civilian populations in Donetsk and Luhansk. We urge all parties to strictly comply with the tenets of international law.We may be at the precipice, but we have not fallen over it. The path of dialogue and diplomacy remains. We urge the reversal of escalatory actions and invite the Secretary-General to renew his good offices with regard to the situation in the eastern regions of Ukraine, in close coordination with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and all other relevant partners.","Let me start by thanking Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo for the updates she has brought to the Council tonight.When the Organization was established in 1945, it entrusted the Security Council with the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Tension in and around Ukraine is being aggravated on a daily — indeed, hourly — basis, giving that habitual quotation from the Charter of the United Nations extraordinary importance and relevance.We are all aware of how critical the situation has become. Brazil is following the latest developments with extreme concern. In the present circumstance, we in the Council, in representation of the international community, must reiterate calls for immediate de-escalation and our steadfast commitment in support of political and diplomatic efforts to create the conditions for a peaceful solution to the crisis.The collective security system of the United Nations rests ultimately on the pillar of international law. That pillar, in turn, rests upon the core principles enshrined in the Charter: the sovereign equality and the territorial integrity of Member States, restraint in the use or threat of use of force, and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Yet that pillar and those principles will not yield results unless the legitimate concerns of all parties are taken into consideration and unless there is full respect for the Charter and for existing commitments, such as the Minsk agreements.In that vein, we renew our appeal to all concerned parties to maintain dialogue in a spirit of openness, understanding and flexibility and with a sense of urgency to find ways for a lasting peace in Ukraine and in the wider region.A first inescapable objective is an immediate ceasefire, with the comprehensive disengagement of troops and military equipment on the ground. Such a military disengagement will be an important step to build trust among the parties, to strengthen diplomacy and to seek a sustainable solution to the crisis.We firmly believe that the Council must live up to its core responsibility to help the parties engage in a meaningful and effective dialogue so as to achieve a solution that effectively addresses the security concerns within the region. Let us make no mistake — at the end of the day, we are talking about the lives of innocent men, women and children on the ground.","I thank Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo for her briefing.We meet tonight on the brink of a major conflict in Ukraine. The diplomacy we urged on 17 February (see S/PV.8968) is failing. The territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine stands breached. The Charter of the United Nations continues to wilt under the relentless assault of the powerful. One moment it is invoked with reverence by the very same countries that at another turn their backs on it in pursuit of objectives diametrically opposed to international peace and security.In the two most recent meetings on the situation in Ukraine (see S/PV.8960 and S/PV.8968) and given the build-up of forces by the Russian Federation, Kenya urged that diplomacy be given a chance. Our cry was not heeded, and, more importantly, the Charter’s demand for States to settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered has been profoundly undermined.Today the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of Ukraine has been effected. Kenya is gravely concerned by the announcement made by the Russian Federation to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine as independent States. In our considered view, that action and announcement breach the territorial integrity of Ukraine.We do not deny that there may be serious security concerns in those regions. But they cannot justify today’s recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent States when there were multiple diplomatic tracks available and under way that have the ability to offer peaceful solutions.This situation echoes our own history. Kenya and almost every African country were birthed by the ending of empire. Our borders were not of our own drawing. They were drawn in the distant colonial metropoles of London, Paris and Lisbon with no regard for the ancient nations that they cleaved apart.Today across the border of every single African country live our countrymen with whom we share deep historical, cultural and linguistic bonds. At independence, had we chosen to pursue States on the basis of ethnic, racial or religious homogeneity, we would still be waging bloody wars these many decades later. Instead, we agreed that we would settle for the borders that we inherited, but we would still pursue continental, political, economic and legal integration. Rather than form nations that looked ever backwards into history with a dangerous nostalgia, we chose to look forward to a greatness that none of our many nations and peoples had ever known.We chose to follow the rules of the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations Charter not because our borders satisfied us but because we wanted something greater forged in peace. We believe that all States formed from empires that have collapsed or retreated have many peoples in them yearning for integration with peoples in neighbouring States. That is normal and understandable. After all, who does not want to be joined to their brethren and to make common purpose with them?However, Kenya rejects such a yearning from being pursued by force. We must complete our recovery from the embers of dead empires in a way that does not plunge us back into new forms of domination and oppression. We rejected irredentism and expansionism on any basis, including racial, ethnic, religious or cultural factors. We reject that again today.Kenya registers its strong concern and opposition to the recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent States. We further strongly condemn the trend by powerful States in the past few decades, including members of the Security Council, breaching international law with little regard.Multilateralism lies on its deathbed tonight. It has been assaulted today, as it has been by other powerful States in the recent past. We call on all Member States to rally behind the Secretary-General in asking him to rally us all to the standard that defends multilateralism. We also call on him to bring his good offices to bear to help the parties concerned to resolve this situation by peaceful means.Let me conclude by reaffirming Kenya’s respect for the territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.","At the outset, I would like to thank the Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo, for her updates and briefing this evening.I would like to refer to the statement that the United Arab Emirates delivered in this Chamber on 17 February on the same subject (see S/PV.8968). I would like to emphasize once again the importance of de-escalation and restraint in order to maintain regional and international security and stability. We believe that now is the time to engage constructively and in good faith to address the current situation and mitigate its impact, of course, on any civilians and civilian infrastructure and to chart a diplomatic path forward.The United Arab Emirates reiterates the importance of dialogue, as others have said, de-escalation and diplomacy, and of continuing all efforts to reach a peaceful solution consistent with international law and the Charter of the United Nations, particularly the principles of territorial integrity, independence, sovereignty and good-neighbourliness. We believe that the Minsk agreements form a good basis for that and that adherence to those principles is indeed a sustainable pillar of a peaceful pathway forward.","First of all, I would like to thank Ms. DiCarlo for her briefing.Over the past few weeks, our attention has often been focused on developments in the situation on the border between Russia and Ukraine, amid fears of military action and escalating rhetoric by the parties. Following the call made by the Russian State Duma, some days ago, to recognize the sovereignty of the separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, all signs point to imminent action.Today Russia announced its decision to recognize the sovereignty of the self-declared Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics. That decision is heavy with consequence for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. It also undermines the relevance and implementation of the Minsk agreements.Gabon is particularly committed to the principles of tangible borders, territorial integrity and national sovereignty and notes the fact that the core principles of international relations are being undermined. My country calls upon all parties to de-escalate, demonstrate restraint and adhere to the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes, in line with the Charter of the United Nations. We encourage them to use the channels of dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the crisis and prevent irreparable damage.","It is with unease that I will now remove my mask, and it is not because of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We are all vaccinated; there are vaccines for COVID-19. It is because of the virus that has so far no vaccine — the virus that hit the United Nations and the virus that is spread by the Kremlin. The delegation of Ukraine has requested this urgent meeting to draw the attention of the Security Council to the illegal and illegitimate decision of the President of the Russian Federation to recognize the occupied parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine as the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics.Today the entire membership of the United Nations is under attack — under attack by the country that occupied the membership of the Security Council in 1991 bypassing the Charter of the United Nations; the country that occupied the parts of the territory of Georgia in 2008; and the country that occupied parts of Ukraine in 2014.As stated by the President of Ukraine, Mr. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, following the urgent meeting of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine have been and will remain unchangeable, regardless of any statements and actions by the Russian Federation. Ukraine unequivocally qualifies the recent actions by the Russian Federation as violations of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. The political leadership of the Russian Federation shall bear full responsibility for the outcomes of the decisions taken.Recognition of the occupied parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine can be considered as a unilateral withdrawal by Russia from the Minsk agreements and shows its disregard for the decisions taken in the framework of the Normandy Four. This step undermines peaceful efforts and ruins the existing negotiating frameworks.Through the decisions adopted today and those that may be adopted tomorrow, Russia attempts to legalize the presence of its troops, which have actually been in the occupied areas of Donbas since 2014. A country that has fuelled the war for eight years is not able to maintain peace, as it claims.What will happen next? We want peace, and we are consistent in our actions. Today the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine sent a request, on the basis of the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, to the guarantors of Ukraine’s security, demanding immediate consultations. A Security Council meeting and a special meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation (OSCE) were called. We insist on the full-fledged operations of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine in order to prevent provocations and further escalation. An emergency summit of the Normandy Four was also requested.We expect from our partners clear and efficient shows of support. We will now see who our true friends and partners are — who is on the side of the Charter of the United Nations and who will continue to deter Russia through words only. We are committed to a political diplomatic settlement and will not succumb to provocations.In accordance with Article 51 of the Charter, Ukraine has the inherent right to individual and collective self-defence. We are committed to a peaceful and diplomatic path and will not waver. We are on our land. We are not afraid of anything or anyone. We do not owe anyone anything, and we will not give anything away to anyone. There should be no doubt whatsoever, because it is not February 2014. It is February 2022. This is a different country and a different army. Our one goal is peace — peace in Ukraine and peace in Europe, global peace“[W]e must do all we can to make sure that the problem of Donbas is resolved through the implementation of the Minsk agreements.” (see S/PV.8968)That was said here in this Chamber just four days ago by the Russian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs in the chair of the President of the Council, with reference to President Putin, who took the decision that we are discussing today, which is a threat to the rules-based order and to the Charter, in particular its Article 2, as well as to international peace and security.The Security Council has been tasked with maintaining that peace and security, under Article 24 of the Charter. Pursuant to Article 39, the Security Council shall make recommendations or decide what measures shall be taken to maintain or restore international peace and security. The delegation of Ukraine calls on the Security Council members to exercise those duties.We invite the Russian Federation to carefully re-read today’s statement again and again, in which the Secretary-General considers Russia’s decision to be a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. I thank the Secretary-General for that powerful statement.In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that it remains up to Russia to abandon its long-standing strategy on Ukraine, one based on threats and the use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of my country, and to re-engage with what we all have committed to — the fundamental principles of peaceful relations, as enshrined in the United Nations Charter.We demand that Russia cancel its decision to recognize the occupied parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine and return to the negotiations table. We condemn the order to deploy additional Russian occupation troops in the territories of Ukraine. We demand the immediate, complete and verifiable withdrawal of the occupation troops.The United Nations is sick. That is a matter of fact. It has been hit by the virus spread by the Kremlin. Whether or not it succumbs to the virus is in the hands of the membership. Today the Kremlin copy-pasted — word for word — the decree on Georgia of 2008. They copy-pasted it word for word, with no creativity whatsoever. The copying machine in the Kremlin works very well. Who will be the next United Nations Member? That is an open question.","I would like to start by thanking Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo for her briefing.Only four days after our most recent meeting (see S/PV.8968), the Security Council meets again to discuss the situation in Ukraine. On Thursday there was consensus in the Security Council that the Minsk agreements, which the Council unanimously endorsed in resolution 2202 (2015), needs to be implemented by all, including the Russian Federation.Today we are confronted with the very opposite from Russia. President Putin’s decision to recognize the separatist, self-declared “people’s republics” in eastern Ukraine is not only a blatant breach of resolution 2202 (2015), but also of the basic principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. It is another flagrant and deliberate violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, after the illegal annexation of Crimea and the instigation and fuelling of the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine since 2014. Russia has repeatedly insisted that it was not a party to the conflict. Today it unmasks itself and shows that it always has been.My Government condemns Russia’s violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms. With our allies and partners, we will take firm and adequate measures in response to Russia’s breach of international law that will have serious economic, political and geostrategic consequences. I call on all United Nations States Members to join us in condemning Russia’s actions of today.Today’s decision comes in the context of an unprecedented build-up of Russian forces around Ukraine over the past weeks and months. Those forces seem poised to attack. We have seen a flare-up along the line of contact over the past few days and efforts that appear to fabricate a pretext for a Russian attack. Moreover, Russia has declared its readiness to deploy troops in eastern Ukraine.The Charter of the United Nations is crystal-clear: it unequivocally prohibits the threat of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of States. The current Russian force deployment around Ukraine can only be considered a further threat against Ukraine’s territorial integrity.I call on Russia to live up to its obligations as a permanent member of the Security Council, and I urge Russia to immediately revoke today’s decisions and re-commit to the Minsk agreements, in line with what the Normandy Four agreed upon. Russia must not cross the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine. Moreover, Russia must immediately withdraw its troops from the regions bordering with Ukraine in Russia and Belarus.I call on Russia to recommit to the rules-based security architecture in Europe, which has been built over decades. Russia’s decisions have put that order under serious strain. We call upon Russia to return to the path of diplomacy, instead of shedding further blood.Germany will spare no diplomatic effort in this regard, while steadfastly standing by Ukraine, its territorial integrity, its sovereignty and the Ukrainian people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S/PV.8726,18/02/2020,"A Council meeting on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the package of measures, the third component of the Minsk agreements, called by Russia.","China thanks the Under-Secretary-General, Ms. DiCarlo; the Special Representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Chairperson-in- Office, Ambassador Grau; and the ОSCE Special Monitoring Mission Chief Monitor, Ambassador Çevik, for their briefings. In February 2015, the Minsk agreements were signed and subsequently endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 2202 (2015). China believes that the agreements have played a vital role in the political mediation of the Ukrainian crisis. Over five years, their authority has been fully recognized by all parties. The various mechanisms related to the implementation of the agreements have generally functioned smoothly. We note that in December last year, the Normandy Four summit was successfully relaunched and the parties reached an important consensus on the implementation of the Minsk agreements, which is a clear indication that the Normandy format retains the full support of all the parties and remains the key to the political mediation of the Ukrainian crisis. China calls on the parties to fully implement the agreements, remain committed to achieving a political settlement and seek a comprehensive solution to the crisis through dialogue and consultation in order to facilitate the realization of peace, stability and development in Ukraine, promote harmony among all ethnic groups in Ukraine and foster Ukraine’s peaceful coexistence with the other countries of the region. China has always adopted an objective and impartial position on the Ukrainian crisis and respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, including Ukraine. It also opposes interference in Ukraine’s internal affairs by any foreign forces. We have always believed that there is no military solution to the crisis and that dialogue and negotiation are the only way forward. China will continue to play a constructive role in reaching a political settlement to the Ukrainian crisis. ","I thank the Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, the Special Representative of the Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Chief Monitor of the ОSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine for their briefings. Six years following the start of hostilities, the conflict in Ukraine remains the deadliest on the European continent. We cannot accept the fact that the conflict, which has led to the deaths of more than 13,000 persons, rages on, while millions of men and women continue to suffer as a result of the war. It is for that reason that, over the past few months, France, along with Germany, has worked to give new impetus to efforts to resolve the conflict. The Heads of State of the four countries of the Normandy format met in Paris on 9 December last year and reaffirmed their commitment to a set of principles. First and foremost, they reaffirmed their commitment to the Minsk agreements as a framework for the settlement of the conflict. Then, during the summit, we also set out tangible specific measures to make headway towards the implementation of the Minsk agreements. Those are the measures that now need to be implemented, and the Trilateral Contact Group is working towards that end. A first positive step was taken with the release and exchange of 200 prisoners on 29 December. Discussions conflict-related prisoners. France recalls the vital nature of access for international organizations and the International Committee of the Red Cross to all detained persons on either side of the contact line and of the identification of the approximately 1,500 persons who have disappeared since 2014. Progress is necessary in a number of other areas. Violations of the ceasefire continue on a daily basis, notwithstanding the commitment reiterated on 9 December to ensure full respect for it along the contact line. In that regard, I deplore today’s fighting, which has caused at least one death and several injuries. I call on the parties, in particular the separatist armed groups, to refrain from any provocation, in order to avoid any military escalation on the ground. The OSCE’s Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine is contributing every day to ensuring accurate monitoring of the security situation, thanks to the courage of the women and men engaged on the ground. We condemn in the strongest possible terms all actions that undermine their security or aim at obstructing their mission. The mandate of the Special Mission must be able to be fully implemented throughout the territory of Ukraine, including near the Russian-Ukrainian border. The identification of new disengagement zones and the question of identifying and opening new crossing points are very concrete issues. Progress is expected in that context as well, just as it is expected in the area of mine clearance. Beyond those measures, the objective remains the implementation of the political clauses of the Minsk agreements. That is the most difficult part, but the current momentum should enable progress to be made in defining local self-government arrangements for certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and in incorporating the Steinmeier formula into Ukrainian legislation. In that context, civilian populations are the first victims. Ukraine is facing one of the biggest humanitarian crises of the last 10 years. Some 3.4 million people continue to depend on humanitarian assistance. Every effort must be made to facilitate access for humanitarian organizations and United Nations agencies, especially in the territories controlled by the separatist entities. We call on all parties to implement their obligations and on Russia to use its influence on the separatists for the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, in the interests of a civilian population now caught between heavy weapons and mines. Pending the return to a lasting peace, to which we are endeavouring to contribute by continuing negotiations and the prospect of a forthcoming summit in Normandy format, Ukraine can count on the full and complete support of France. ","We are grateful for the support for our initiative to convene today’s meeting on an issue that is highly relevant to European security, and we thank the briefers for their assessments. We welcome to today’s meeting the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Mr. Kyslytsya. As far as we understand, we will soon be meeting here in New York more frequently, and we look forward to constructive cooperation with him. Yesterday marked exactly five years since the adoption of resolution 2202 (2015), approving a set of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements. The document has therefore become a mandatory component of international law. Unfortunately, few remember that. Thus, during a Security Council meeting on cooperation with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) that took place on 6 February (see S/PV.8715), it came to light that members of the Council with significant influence on the settlement process in Ukraine, including the parties to the Normandy Format, prefer not to recall what has been explicitly set out both in the resolution and the package of measures. They have attempted to conceal their forgetfulness by resorting to the mantra, so to speak, that the Russian Federation is failing to comply with its obligations. We deeply regret the fact that for five years, our Western partners, which at the time supported the anti-constitutional Maidan coup d’état, with its rabid Russophobia and nationalism, did not deign to absorb the fact that the parties to the Minsk agreements are not Russia and Ukraine but, rather, Ukraine and the Republic of Donbas. What is even more alarming is the fact that Kyiv has of late egregiously ratcheted up its rhetoric, which casts doubt on the Minsk agreements. For example, our initiative to convene today’s Security Council meeting has been called by the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry a ploy on the part of Russian diplomacy aimed at generating a parallel political reality. Let us recall that just a year ago, on 12 February, during a similar Security Council meeting (see S/PV.8461), the permanent representative of Ukraine, Mr. Yelchenko, expressed his gratitude to the presidency of the Security Council for the opportunity to participate in a meeting on “an issue of the utmost concern to us”. Many eminent Ukrainian politicians have also joined the campaign to sabotage the Minsk agreements. They are blatantly contradicting the political will that was announced by President Zelenskyy in Paris towards a settlement. Will alone indeed is insufficient; what is necessary are concrete measures. Only in recent days we have heard from Mr. Kryvonos, Deputy Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, that the Ukrainian forces “need to stand ready to use force to liberate the territory of Donbas”. The Defence Minister, Mr. Zagorodniuk, objected to disengagement along the entire line of contact because, allegedly, “this runs counter to the very essence of the Minsk agreements”. Yet this is actually the very essence of the first paragraph of the Minsk package of measures. The representative of Ukraine to the subgroup on political issues of the Trilateral Contact Group, Mr. Resnikov, said that Minsk agreements are at the very minimum subject to partial revision. Just yesterday, the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, Mr. Avakov, said, “We are considering a step-by-step approach; on one day we will take up one area, and the next day, another one”. At the same time, the Ukrainian security forces persist in their attempts to take up the positions of militiamen in the so-called grey zones, where there should be no military personnel at all. We proposed today’s meeting specifically because for millions of residents in eastern Ukraine, whom Kyiv and its partners in this Chamber prefer not to remember, the Minsk agreements are neither a ploy nor a parallel reality but the sole real hope for peace. Only after their implementation will Ukraine have an opportunity to rebuild the eroded trust of the people of Donbas, whom the Ukrainian authorities have demoted in an instant to second-class citizens, labelling them separatists and aliens in their own land. We cannot but be troubled by the attempts to deliberately or unwittingly supplant the Minsk basis for a settlement with other formats, for example, the Normandy format, which, let us recall, was created specifically to support the implementation of the Minsk agreements. Therefore, we deem it important to reiterate that the efforts made under this format will be effective only if they are rooted in unconditional implementation of the package of measures and agreements reached under the Normandy format. This specific approach was endorsed in the agreed conclusions of the quartet summit held in Paris on 9 December. It is the implementation of this approach by all parties, primarily Ukraine, that will become for us a decisive factor for us in assessing the viability of a new meeting in the Normandy format. So far as we can see, hostilities are ongoing, including today in the area near Luhansk. There is no progress on the issues of disengagement of forces and equipment, interaction on demining, permanent introduction of the Steinmeyer formula in the Ukrainian legislation; there is no willingness to agree on the disengagement of forces in new areas, and no readiness for direct dialogue with the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic. Before our meeting, we circulated the text of the package of measures as an official document of the Security Council so that all those here present could have an opportunity to refresh their memory as to the fact that not only is Russia not mentioned there, but also that the 13 points contained therein set out a clear sequence for implementation: ceasefire, amnesty, constitutional reform, with the provision of special status to Donbas and the right to linguistic self-determination, then the holding of elections and only after that the restoration of Government control throughout the conflict zone. Unfortunately, of the 13 points to date perhaps only two have been implemented, that is, those on the proceedings of the Contact Group in Minsk and the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission. Many of those present have themselves spoken of the devastating plight of the residents of Donbas yet have refused to acknowledge the responsibility of Kyiv, which, in waging war against its own population, has imposed a transport, food and economic blockade against Donbas. Every day for the past five years, people have died as a result of the shelling. Are they shooting themselves? Were they the ones who started the war and marched on Kyiv? A scenario whereby in Kyiv they propose first allowing Ukrainian soldiers into Donbas, which former civilian militias have been protecting for all these years, risking their lives every day, and then giving the Ukrainian armed forces control over the border is absolutely unacceptable to eastern Ukraine. That position must be respected, since no settlement is possible without taking the views of the residents of Donetsk and Luhansk into account. I believe that it is time to finally understand that elections in Donbas can take place only in a climate of public trust in the electoral process. That requires specific conditions in which Kyiv cannot oppress politically those who enjoy genuine popular support — those whom all Ukrainian politicians call separatists and whose punishment they call for and those whom the residents of Donbas, in turn, consider to be their protectors, who uphold their right to life and their identity. We need guarantees of a truly inclusive political process. We know the points that some representatives are about to make. We therefore wish to warn Council members in advance that every time they say that Russia is failing to comply with the Minsk agreements, they should remember that they are deliberately misleading their own people and the international community. Every time that they refuse to acknowledge Kyiv’s responsibility and urge Kyiv to comply with its obligations towards its own people and instead wait for someone else to step in and do it, they prolong the suffering of the residents of Donbas, who, unlike them, know the truth and defend it at the cost of their own blood. The longer they play along with Kyiv, the less the opportunity for a mutually respectful dialogue between Ukrainian citizens on both sides of the demarcation line. Yet it is precisely dialogue between belligerent parties that we all call for in all other conflicts, be it in Syria, Yemen or Libya. Only Donbas is denied that right. We therefore hope to hear our colleagues’ commitment to the Council’s unanimous adoption of resolution 2202 (2015) and presidential statement S/PRST/2018/12 of 6 June 2018 in support of the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements. That document is part of international law and should be implemented unconditionally. I would like to say to the Ukrainian representative that I am glad he is interested in Russian poetry. But that is not surprising — we all come from the same country and were probably taught the same lessons at school. I want to correct him. “O, do the Russians long for war? Ask of the stillness evermore Ask of the soldiers who now lie Beneath the birch trees ...” He missed one line. I do not know whose portraits will be carried on 9 May. I do not think that it will be those of Stalin. I doubt that. However, I wonder what portraits will be carried in Kyiv on 9 May and whether there will even be a parade in Kyiv commemorating our — by the way — shared victory in the Great Patriotic War. Today we heard many things. It is impossible to respond to all of it and, in fact, that is not the task before me. Unfortunately, we have not heard anything new. Everything is as before — the same old tune. The representative of Ukraine calls on Moscow to comply with the Minsk agreements but, for some reason, he does not appeal to Kyiv. There is the same tinkering with the Minsk agreements and the issues of cause and effect. It seems that it was Russia that started the war in Ukraine, not Kyiv that came to Donbas. We again heard that Russia must withdraw its troops. But last year, we asked Mr. Apakan and Mr. Sajdik to tell us about the presence of Russian troops in Donbas (see S/PV.8461). They were unable to say anything precise or satisfactory to those who posed the question. Perhaps Ms. Grau and Mr. Çevik have more information. We can ask them where they saw Russian troops in Donbas. We are told that with a wave of the hand Moscow can end this conflict as soon as we tell the Donbas representatives. I have a question. My question is this: are they really that naive to think that the Kremlin is puppet master to those individuals in Donbas? Do they actually think those individuals do not have their own opinions, that they are nothing more than puppets of the Kremlin? I do not believe they are so naive as to think so. My friend Ambassador Heusgen never ceases to amaze me. His country is one of the authors of the Minsk agreements. I personally do not know Mr. Pashkov, who was the Vice-Governor of the Irkutsk region. But I want to ask Mr. Heusgen and Mr. Kyslytsya a question: does the fact that United States citizen Natalie Jaresko was once Finance Minister of Ukraine, that Lithuanian citizen Aivaras Abromavičius was Economy Minister and that United States citizen Ulana Suprun was Minister of Health — incidentally, she is from Chicago, which is 8,000 kilometres from Kyiv, greater than the distance from Kyiv to Irkutsk — lead us to think that the United States and Lithuania are direct parties to the conflict in Ukraine? I will not even mention the example of United States Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, who found himself entangled in the impeachment affair and who claimed that he was three times offered to be made Minister of Defence of Ukraine — something he himself acknowledged was a joke. Mr. Heusgen noted that today was a sad day for international law and for Ukraine. Was he referring to the anniversary of the adoption of resolution 2202 (2015), which endorsed the Minsk package of measures? Does it mean that for him the day of the adoption of that resolution is a tragic day? He referred to how Vladislav Surkov deftly persuaded the representatives of Donbas to sign on to the Minsk agreements. Mr. Heusgen perhaps should know that the Donbas representatives who signed the Minsk agreements in 2015 saw it as an enormous concession and defeat. Today the Ukrainian authorities do not even want to engage in dialogue with them, labelling them not just separatists but terrorists. There was much said about today’s hostilities in the area of Holubivske. According to the information available to us, on 18 February a division from the Ukrainian armed forces attempted to destabilize the situation along the line of contact in Donbas. At approximately 6 a.m., a 10-person sabotage group from the armed forces of Ukraine moved towards the positions of the Luhansk forces near Holubivske. That operation by the Ukrainian armed forces was revealed at an early stage. As they approached the contact line, the group tripped a landmine, which killed at least two people and injured three more. In order to evacuate the dead and wounded from the area, the armed forces of Ukraine carried out a large-scale artillery attack targeting residential areas in the Luhansk People’s Republic. That offensive strike was carried out using medium-calibre mortars and large-calibre artillery in vicinity of Holubivske, Sokilnyky, Donetskyi and Smeloye. Ukrainian military forces fired more than 50 mortar shells into the territory of the Luhansk People’s Republic. Mr. Kyslytsya showed us a photograph of an unfortunate 22-year-old young man, Maksim Khitailov, who died today, apparently in the same area. He was a grenade-launcher operator with the 72nd Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian armed forces. That is a tragic event, but why are they deploying young men to die there? We remember how Mr. Kyslytsya’s former Minister, Mr. Klimkin, seating in that very chair, showed us a photograph of an unfortunate girl who had died on their line of contact. I asked him, the next time he visited the Security Council, to please bring photographs of civilians who had died as a result of the actions of Ukrainian security forces in Donbas. Many such photographs could be provided. I will do so myself the next time, because most likely I will not wait for the Ukrainian side to do it. This is an ongoing tragedy. And this tragedy must end. The way to end it is by implementing the Minsk agreements. Mr. Heusgen also told us today about violations at the line of contact. In that regard, let me turn to statistics from the Special Monitoring Mission. Ukrainian forces were responsible for 60 per cent of firing incidents between 9 December 2019 and 12 February 2020. Kyiv committed 3,737 ceasefire violations, as opposed to 2,809 coming from Donbas territory — and that is just the cases in which the violator could be identified. The overall number of violations stands at 45,244 explosions on one side and 12,114 on the other side. There are 304 pieces of equipment west of the line of demarcation — a violation — as opposed to none on the east side. During the same period, Ukrainian security forces targeted three residential areas in Donbas, while there was not a single attack against territory under Kyiv’s control. Unfortunately, he does not want to see what could not be clearer. I do not know what type of eyeglasses could help him see that. I continue to be surprised at where he gets his information about “unfortunate people who have been coping with that tremendous oppression in Russian-occupied Crimea”. I have called on him many times to go to Crimea and have a look for himself how the “unfortunate Crimeans” are suffering there. Two speakers today mentioned the Malaysian Airlines Flight MH-17 disaster. Of course, that is not the subject of today’s meeting. I do not think they should present that information pretending to be a prosecutor. And I myself am not a prosecutor. Moreover, I want to share with the Council some surprising information published by Western media outlets today, namely, that Dutch military intelligence and security services did not detect a single Buk anti-aircraft missile system in the area where the aircraft was downed. We have repeatedly said that the investigation is shockingly closed and opaque. That information, which needs to be verified and corroborated, of course, only serves as proof. Lastly, I would like once again to recall the fact that it is important for us to understand that there are two sides, not three, in this conflict — and not two, Ukraine and Russia, in the view of our Ukrainian colleagues — namely, it is Donbas and Kyiv. As long as there is no direct dialogue between Kyiv and Donbas, there can be no settlement in Ukraine, just as there can be no settlement without direct dialog between the parties to the conflicts in Afghanistan, Syria, Cyprus, Colombia or anywhere else in the world. Only an inclusive dialogue can generate opportunities and guarantees for lasting peace. For that reason, the Normandy format is meaningful only if it is geared towards the implementation of the Minsk package of measures, which need to be implemented without any preconditions. I say to Mr. Kyslytsya not to try to drive a wedge between me and Spokesperson Peskov. I saw his statement this morning. The information I referred to was not written at Sixty-seventh Street — where the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations is located — it is information we received today after the situation had been clarified.","I thank our briefers who are joining us via video-teleconference from Kyiv and the Under Secretary-General. The Minsk agreements provide a road map to a peaceful resolution of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The United Kingdom reiterates its firm support for those agreements and Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. I welcome the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs here today and thank him for joining us. The United Kingdom underlines its support for French and German efforts to facilitate a negotiated end to the conflict through the Normandy process. We welcome President Zelenskyy’s clear commitment to ending the conflict and the important steps that he has taken towards achieving peace through diplomatic means, including prisoner exchanges, his acceptance of the Steinmeier formula and progress on disengagement. The Russian Ambassador spoke at length about the failure of others in fulfilling their obligations under the Minsk agreements. His account was largely a falsehood wrapped in a fiction inside a fairy tale. Rather than elaborate on where we believe the Russian account is misleading, I will say simply that I endorse what the German representative said in laying out all the areas of the agreements that Russia has violated. Rather than reining in its proxies in the non-Government-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine, Russia has furnished them with arms and personnel. Russia claims to act only in the interest of the Ukrainians living in those areas but does nothing to ensure the safe delivery of international humanitarian aid so desperately needed by many of the communities there. Russia’s only objective in Ukraine is to undermine that country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. It wants Moscow rather than the Ukrainians themselves to define Ukraine’s future. We agree with Russia that local elections should pave the way for special status to be granted in parts of the Donbas region, but the local elections can take place only in proper conditions, and these conditions include a comprehensive ceasefire, unfettered access for the Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the withdrawal of foreign troops. As we heard, that is a far cry from the reality we face today. Two months since the previous Normandy Four summit, ceasefire violations continue along the line of contact, including the use of heavy artillery. Ukrainian troops continue to die at the hands of separatists armed and sponsored by Russia. As recently as this morning, as other speakers noted, there was a sharp increase in violations of the ceasefire near the Zolote disengagement area. Despite the efforts of international demining organizations like the HALO Trust — an organization that my Government is proud to support — Russia’s proxies are planting yet more mines near the Petrivske disengagement area. We heard how the Special Monitoring Mission’s freedom of movement is severely limited, and we constantly see the Monitoring Mission’s reporting of sophisticated Russian equipment, such as the Zhitel jamming device. In 2018 and 2019, Special Monitoring Mission long-range unmanned aerial vehicles observed military-type tracks on dirt-track roads between the border and a holding site in the non-Government controlled areas on no fewer than seven occasions. The culmination of those Russian actions has had a devastating impact on the lives of Ukrainian civilians. In the six years since the conflict began, more than 13,000 people, including approximately 3,500 civilians, have lost their lives and almost 30,000 have been injured. Some 3.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. Russia bears a heavy responsibility for the ongoing suffering. We therefore invite Russia to immediately cease the practice of sending uninspected “humanitarian convoys” across the border and to focus instead on facilitating the safe delivery of international aid, based on an agreed international mechanism, as foreseen under the Minsk agreements. We also look to Russia to ensure that the International Committee of the Red Cross has full and unconditional access to the detainees held in the non-Government controlled areas — access that, the OSCE has said, was denied as recently as January. Russia claims that it is not party to the conflict. In reality, Russia started the conflict in Ukraine. Russia continues to fuel the conflict in Ukraine, and people suffer because of it. I for one welcome the Russian Ambassador’s enthusiasm for Security Council meetings on Ukraine, and we look forward to other future opportunities to ask Russia what Russia is doing to ensure that the agreements are implemented. I would like to conclude by reiterating the United Kingdom’s enduring support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders and territorial waters. The Ukrainian people deserve peace, and we will continue to hold Russia to account to that end. ","I thank the briefers for their presentations. In 2014, Russia occupied Crimea and fuelled the conflict in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 13,000 people, displaced millions and precipitated an alarming humanitarian crisis. Russia’s ongoing aggressive actions are an affront to international norms and a threat to our common security. The position of the United States is clear: we continue to support the Minsk agreements as the way forward in eastern Ukraine. We fully back the Normandy format process. The resolution to this conflict must be a diplomatic one, and we will continue to engage with allies and partners to support Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Through its actions, Ukraine has made clear its commitment to achieving a peaceful resolution of the conflict. President Zelenskyy has energized conflict diplomacy through outreach to Ukrainian citizens in eastern Ukraine, enabled improvements to humanitarian conditions on both sides of the line of contact, negotiated two prisoner exchanges and established a dialogue with President Putin that yielded the first Normandy summit since 2016. Unfortunately, Russia has not shown a similar willingness to fulfil its commitments under the Minsk agreements. It continues to arm, train, lead and fight alongside its proxy forces in eastern Ukraine. That stands in direct contravention of Russia’s commitments under the Minsk agreements, including to establish an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire. In that regard, today’s attack by Russian-led forces near Zolote, which resulted in Ukrainian casualties, took place on the five-year anniversary of Russian-led forces taking the key rail hub of Debaltseve in direct contravention of the terms of the Minsk agreements reached only a week earlier. Now, as then, Russian-led forces continue to contravene commitments made by President Putin and Russian officials and to kill Ukrainians on Ukrainian territory. Instead of engaging constructively, Russia stalls and disseminates disinformation to distract attention from its central, unmistakable and unjustifiable role in fomenting this conflict. Russia also continues its hybrid activities against Ukraine, wielding economic and political leverage. Russia must end this conflict by withdrawing its forces from eastern Ukraine and Crimea. We call on Russia to immediately implement its security commitments under the Minsk agreements, as the parties can move forward with the Minsk political measures only once there is security on the ground. We also call on Russia to follow through with the measures outlined at the recent Normandy summit in Paris to immediately stabilize the situation in the conflict area, which include the opening of new civilian crossing points, disengaging military forces in areas of the greatest humanitarian significance and implementing ceasefire support measures. The United States underscores its unequivocal position on Ukraine. We do not, and will not, recognize the Kremlin’s purported annexation of Crimea. Our sanctions against Russia will remain in place until Ukraine regains control over its territory. In the name of international peace and security, we call on Russia to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, extending to its territorial waters. We condemn the abuses taking place under Russia’s repressive occupation and call on Russia to release the more than 80 Ukrainian political prisoners it is holding and to end its campaign of intimidation against Crimean Tatars and opponents of the occupation. We will never accept anything less than the full restoration of Ukraine’s control over its own territory, whether in eastern Ukraine, Crimea or its territorial waters. I thank our briefers who are joining us via video-teleconference from Kyiv and the Under Secretary-General. The Minsk agreements provide a road map to a peaceful resolution of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The United Kingdom reiterates its firm support for those agreements and Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity.

",,,,,,,,,,,"First of all, I thank those members of the Security Council who have expressed their strong solidarity with Ukraine in the face of the ongoing Russian aggression. I also express our appreciation for the informative briefings today.When the Russian Federation called for a Council meeting on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the package of measures, the third component of the Minsk agreements, one might have believed that Russia finally planned to report to the Council that it was going to honour the agreements made in this very Chamber in 2015.Although not adopted under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, resolution 2202 (2015) has been a very important message from the Council to all parties to implement the agreements, most important to respect a comprehensive ceasefire. Would it make any difference if the Council then, in 2015, had legal grounds to adopt a mandatory document under Chapter VII? If the document had been endowed with a different legal nature, would that be a compelling enough reason for the Russian Federation to implement it?I have no time to dwell hereon the recent constitutional amendments, as proposed in Moscow, that effectively nullify the mandatory nature of international law and international treaties in the Russian Federation. We continue to believe that the Minsk agreements should be implemented, including by the Russian Federation, which so persistently dissociates itself from the agreements.Where do we find ourselves today? It looks as if the answer was given at 6 a.m. local time, when our positions were attacked. The attack carried out today, on the fifth anniversary of the Debaltseve tragedy, is particularly cynical. The Ukrainian armed forces provided an adequate response to that offensive — carried out by the Russian occupation forces with the use of Minsk-proscribed weapons — in the exercise of Ukraine’s inherent right to self-defence.It is clear that the Kremlin continues to pursue a strategy of escalation in Donbas, in flagrant violation of Russia’s obligations, which they have undertaken as a party to the Minsk agreements.As Ukraine’s President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said earlier today, “This is an attempt to disrupt the peace process in Donbas, which has started to move forward by small yet incessant steps”. The Ukrainian leadership has confirmed that our commitment to ending this war and to adhering to the agreements reached remains unshaken, as does our resolve to repel any acts of armed aggression against Ukraine.In total disregard of the agreements reached in Paris in December last year by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany, over the past two months our positions have been shelled more than 400 times. Since the beginning of the year, 13 Ukrainian servicemen have been killed and almost 60 wounded.Can anyone call this a frozen conflict? Or, perhaps, a low-intensity conflict? It is a war — the only ongoing war in Europe. It is a full-scale war waged by Russian troops and Russia’s mercenaries, with weapons and ammunition supplied by the Russian Federation. That is exactly why the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission, as we have learned from Mission reports, is still restricted in terms of freedom of movement and deprived of proper access to the Russian-Ukrainian border.Whenever reminded of its own Minsk commitments, Russia immediately points a finger at Ukraine, saying that it is we who should hold a so-called direct dialogue with the representatives of two so-called local authorities in the temporarily occupied part of Donbas. But what are they?How local is the recently appointed so-called acting head of government of Donetsk, Vladimir Pashkov? This citizen of Russia, born in Siberia, graduated from the Russian Military Pacific Navy School and, until recently, was the Vice-Governor of the Irkutsk region of Russia. Would members like to know how close Irkutsk is to Donetsk? An insignificant 6,000 kilometres. Still, he is local enough, in the opinion of Moscow, to rule in Donbas and to be involved in talks about Donbas’s future. There is no justification for someone from Siberia to be telling us Ukrainians what to do on our own territory.The unfortunate experience of Georgia and Moldova with direct dialogue with the Kremlin’s puppets proves that in the best-case scenario this is a road to nowhere; most probably it is a highway leading directly to a trap.As has happened before, Russia is trying to present the victim of its aggression as the perpetrator thereof. That is one of the hallmarks of its information war against Ukraine. Such vain attempts to twist the truth could have been viewed as pathetic and even laughable were it not a cynical insult to the memory of the thousands of my compatriots who have lost their lives defending their land.I pay tribute here to the memory of those protesters who were gunned down in cold blood in Maidan exactly six years ago, on the night of 18 February, which is now often called the Night of the Apocalypse; to the memory of heroes such as Sergiy Kokurin — ethnically Russian, by the way, a father of two, the first Ukrainian citizen killed in Crimea by a Russian sniper on 18 March 2014, during the military phase of the attempted annexation of the peninsula; to the memory of Klavdia Sytnyk, a young single mother, a paramedic who lost her life on the first day of this month under a barrage of Russian mortars while delivering medications to the wounded; and to the memory of 22-year-old Maxim, who was killed today by bullets supplied by the Russians. My son is about the same age.We should not lose sight of the broader context of the Russian armed aggression against Ukraine. Six years of Russia’s military invasion in Donbas have killed more than 13,000 people and wounded more than 27,000. More than 1.4 million residents of Donbas are now internally displaced persons. The areas seized have turned into a land of fear and terror, with local economies destroyed and equipment belonging to enterprises wrecked or moved to Russia. More than 3.4 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance this year. In addition, this territory, according to the United Nations, has already become one of the most mine-contaminated in the world, as has been repeatedly mentioned today.The Russian Federation continues to supply its occupation forces with weapons, regular troops and mercenaries, to the extent that now they dwarf many European armies, with approximately 500 tanks, around 1,000 armoured combat vehicles and almost 800 artillery systems. Just last year, the Russian Federation sent more than 4,000 tons of weapons and munitions into the occupied territories of Donbas.As if that were not enough, Russia is also pursuing illegal passportization in the temporarily occupied territories of Donbas, which has now reached an industrial level — more than 125,000 persons were issued Russian passports there.The east is not the only front line in Ukraine. In the south, as a result of Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea, the peninsula has been turned into a human rights ghetto and a huge military base, upending regional security, as Russia uses it also for its Syria interventions. The number of political hostages has skyrocketed, and Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars have been repressed. A wall of silence has been built around the peninsula, repelling any international scrutiny, in violation of General Assembly resolutions. According to the Secretary-General’s report on Crimea and regular reports by the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Russia is pursuing covert demographic change, bringing in more than 130,000 military and civil servants in and pushing the local population out. The militarization of occupied Crimea is in full gear as Russia is bringing in additional troops and sophisticated weapons.By launching the so-called Crimean bridge, Russia has not only grossly violated international law and its bilateral treaty obligations; it has created huge economic losses for Ukraine and an exponential environmental threat to the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.Against all odds, Ukraine is working for peace. Achieving peace was a major motivator for Ukrainians who cast their votes in last year’s presidential and parliamentary elections.Another demand of the voters continues to be the return of those who have been illegally detained in the occupied territories of Ukraine and in Russia, who have been held in inhumane conditions and frequently tortured for many years. There are still more than 200 Ukrainians held in uncontrolled parts of Donbas, as well as more than 100 Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars in Crimea and Russia.The Ukrainian side successfully initiated two major mutual releases of detainees with Russia and work is ongoing to ensure their “all for all” release. I take this opportunity to call on colleagues to join me in our appeal to the Russian side to stop preventing unhindered access to detainees by the International Committee of the Red Cross and its search for missing persons.We believe that the agreements reached in Paris in December should expedite the resolution of the conflict. A full and comprehensive ceasefire and unhindered access 24/7 for the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission throughout the entire occupied territory would facilitate the process. While the Russian Foreign Minister gives an endless list as to why the next Normandy summit is not feasible, we are working hard and doing our best to make it possible, as agreed by the leaders of the four countries.As President Zelenskyy stressed only a few days ago, we are fully committed to that endeavour, as evidenced by the new initiative on sectoral disengagement, where the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission will play a key verification role to ensure that a given sector is free from illegally armed groups, foreign armed formations and military equipment.We look forward to holding local elections throughout the territory of Ukraine, including its temporarily occupied parts, once the security and political conditions allow it in accordance with Ukrainian legislation and the Copenhagen document of OSCE and under Ukraine’s control of its internationally recognized borders.We are working hard to finally bring this Russian-Ukrainian war, which was not started by us, to an end no matter how hard the other side tries to prolong it in order to bleed Ukraine dry. We will continue to achieve sustainable peace exclusively through peaceful diplomatic means in accordance with international law. This can be done only together with the Council, including those members present here who are genuinely interested in bringing about peace in Europe as we are about to celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the end of the Second World War and of the creation of the United Nations. Otherwise, our anniversary gathering in New York this autumn will be a gruesome memorial service rather than a celebration of global peace and security.Today’s discussion does not cover all the essential elements for putting an end to Russia’s war against Ukraine and, in particular, Russia’s temporary occupation of parts of our territory, including Crimea. It was therefore decided that the day after tomorrow the General Assembly will consider the agenda item “Situation in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine”, namely, Donbas and Crimea, as it is fundamentally important that the liberation of Ukrainian territory cannot be said to be complete until the last Russian soldier has left the peninsula. I ask members to join us on Thursday in the General Assembly Hall.(spoke in Russian)To conclude my statement, I will speak in Russian so that the Russian people who are not indifferent to the present and the future of their country can hear me. Given that today there was a discussion of a new leader of Donetsk — who is from Irkutsk and who was mentioned by Ambassador Heusgen, among others — I wish to recall the fact that some 90 years ago in a small Siberian town in Irkutsk Oblast with the romantic name Zima a son was born to the family of the Baltic German Alexander Gangnus, son of Rudolph Gangnus. In the context of today’s discussion, it is worth noting that he was the poet who, returning from a trip to the West at the height of the Cold War, wrote the well-known poem “Do the Russians Want War?”. I think that many have already guessed that I am talking about Yevgeny Yevtushenko, also known as Yevgeny Gangnus.“O, do the Russians long for war?Ask of the soldiers who now lieBeneath the birch trees And let their sons tell youWhether the Russians long for war.”I say to the Russian representative that I think that the answer to the question as to whether the Russians want war in the context of today’s Russia will be the parade in Red Square on 9 May, when we will see whether parade participants will carry portraits of Stalin — that same Stalin who has been taken out of the mausoleum and seems is not out of people’s minds. “But how to root out Stalin’s heirs, said Yevtushenko in 1962. He continued:“Let some repeat over and over again: ‘Compose yourself!’I shall never find rest.As long as Stalin’s heirs exist on earth,It will seem to meThat Stalin is still in the mausoleum.”Today, when the glorification of Stalin, whose name is being whitewashed, is gaining traction in the Russian Federation, the memorials to that murderer, dictator and perpetrator of the 1930s genocide of the Ukrainian people are burgeoning.I wish to conclude my statement with a question to the Russian representative: Indeed, do the Russians long for war? The Russian delegation has just presented its account of the nature of the escalation in Donbas today. It was said that is due a provocation led by the armed forces of Ukraine. I want to draw the attention of the Security Council to a statement made today by the Spokesperson of the President of the Russian Federation, Mr. Dmitry Peskov, in relation to what happened.(spoke in Russian)“We do not have the details of this confrontation. We do not know what provoked it. Our hope is that, in the near future, it will be possible to shed light on the details of what occurred, before drawing any conclusions”.(spoke in English)I now address a question to the Russian delegation: Should we listen the Spokesperson of the Russian President, or should we listen to the talking points written at Sixty-seventh Street in New York?",,"We would like to start by thanking Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo, Ms. Heidi Grau and Mr. Halit Çevik for their outstanding briefings. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome His Excellency Mr. Sergiy Kyslytsya here today.The Dominican Republic believes that achieving peace must be a collective responsibility. We therefore appreciate the political and diplomatic efforts made on the ground to create the conditions to restore peace and stability to the Ukrainian people. Following the signing of the Minsk agreements and the subsequent adoption of resolution 2202 (2015), we note continuing violations of the ceasefire, as indicated in the reports of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine. It is concerning that these are so numerous. Worse still, the continuing high death toll is compounded by the alarming number of people affected by poverty and internal displacement.During the conflict, cracks have emerged in the system of public services for civilians, including the limitation of crossing points used daily by thousands of people, the inability to provide timely quality services to meet the needs of the inhabitants in the affected areas, including poor or non-existent mental health care, care for victims of gender violence and other, no less important matters. In that connection, we welcome the efforts and solidarity of the international community to help the most vulnerable population in this area.The Dominican Republic welcomes the meeting of the quartet in the Normandy format, held in Paris in December. We especially thank France and Germany for their efforts in this quest for peace. That important relaunching of the peace negotiations gave birth to the necessary decision to respect the ceasefire regime, to clear mines and to open new border crossings and three new areas for the withdrawal of forces and equipment within the framework of the Trilateral Contact Group at the end of March.We also welcome an additional result of the Paris meeting — the recent exchange of 200 prisoners, a positive step towards progress in the peace process. These actions show the political will of the parties to move towards a definitive solution. We urge the parties to focus on the objectives of the Minsk agreements, with the necessary determination to overcome difficulties and to reach a consensus on differences in order to fully implement the agreements. That is why we believe that it is appropriate to convene a future Normandy format meeting in order to ensure that local elections are held in the best conditions and guarantee the continuity of the negotiations within the framework of the implementation of the peace agreements. We reiterate our commitment to defending the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine, within the internationally recognized borders, while continuing to urge respect for the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes.In conclusion, on the fifth anniversary of the Minsk agreements, we continue to insist that those agreements constitute the legal basis for resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine and the instrument for achieving the political solution that the country and the region long for. We call for the continuation of dialogue between the parties under the auspices of the current Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group. Furthermore, we express our support for the package of measures endorsed through the Council’s adoption of resolution 2202 (2015), which seek the effective implementation of those peace agreements.","I welcome Deputy Foreign Minister Kyslytsya to our meeting today.I wish to begin by thanking the Russian representative for calling for this briefing today, after having witnessed yet another attack in Luhansk oblast by Russian-supported armed formations. Weapons that were prohibited by the Minsk agreements were used, leading to casualties. It is a grave violation of the Minsk agreements and an unfortunate display of Russia’s disregard for its recommitment to the ceasefire during the Paris meeting. However, let us not forget that this is only one chapter in the ongoing Russian aggression against Ukraine that has continued for the past six years.I am grateful to Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo for her important and comprehensive briefing, as well as to the Special Representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Chairperson-in-Office, Ms. Heidi Grau, and the Chief Monitor of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (SMM), Mr. Halit Çevik, for their updates on activities on the ground.Six years since Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine began, we regret that Russia has not acknowledged and reversed its actions. Estonia reaffirms its strong support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, including territorial waters. We condemn the illegal annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol and the occupation of certain territories of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine. The use of force against the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine by the Russian Federation clearly violates the fundamental principles of international law. It violates paragraph 4 of Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations, as well as the Helsinki Final Act.The Minsk agreements remain the basis for a political resolution to the conflict in Donbas. The Russian Federation, however, has continued to breach the Minsk agreements on a regular basis since they were adopted, as we have also witnessed today. It has breached, in particular, the first point of the Minsk agreements — to end the interference and ensure a comprehensive ceasefire. Its actions have left more than 27,000 people wounded and over 14,000 dead, including the 298 passengers on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, which was shot down by a Russian BUK missile system.Moreover, Russia’s initiatives — such as conducting illegal elections, conscripting Ukrainian citizens into the Russian army and pursuing the illegal passportization of Ukrainian citizens — all run counter to the spirit of the Minsk agreements and further obstruct the settlement in Donbas. Let me recall that there is a 400-kilometre uncontrolled border between Ukraine and Russia. That uncontrolled section is a gateway for the free flow of weaponry and military personnel. Russia’s actions in Ukraine pose numerous threats to international peace and security.We therefore call on Russia, as a party to the conflict, to fully implement its commitments under the Minsk agreements, including those undertaken at the Normandy Four summit in Paris on 9 December. We also call on Russia to immediately withdraw its armed forces from Ukraine and stop its political, financial and military support to the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics — that is, Russia’s proxies in Donbas.We commend President Zelenskyy for his strong efforts towards resolving and de-escalating the conflict in Donbas, including initiatives and bold actions that have brought positive developments, such as the exchange of prisoners, the proposal to disengage forces in three areas and the reconstruction of the bridge at Stanytsia Luhanska. We would like to thank the OSCE, including the Special Representative of the OSCE Chairman-in-Office and the Special Monitoring Mission, for all their indispensable work in Ukraine.The SMM remains the most reliable source of information on the situation on the ground in Ukraine. It is therefore regrettable that the restrictions posed on the SMM’s freedom of movement have persisted in non-Government-controlled areas, hindering the Mission from fully implementing its mandate. The SMM’s full, secure and unimpeded access to the entire territory of Ukraine should be guaranteed. Recently, we heard about OSCE efforts and restrictions on the work of the SMM directly from OSCE Chairperson-in-Office, Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, right here in the Security Council (see S/PV.8714). He mentioned the idea of a United Nations peacekeeping mission to Ukraine that would monitor the Russian-Ukrainian border and provide a safe environment and for the restoration of the sovereignty of Ukraine. However, in March 2015, Ukraine’s request for the Security Council to deploy a peacekeeping operation under the auspices of the United Nations was blocked by the Russian Federation — yet another example of the sheer reluctance to take any steps to resolve the conflict.We remain deeply concerned about the grave humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine. Approximately 3.4 million Ukrainians still need humanitarian assistance and protection. In addition to psychological trauma and the lack of access to basic services, about 2 million people live in areas that are heavily contaminated with landmines. Despite aid efforts, the 2019 humanitarian appeal remained only 50 per cent funded. I call on the international community to intensify its financial support for Ukraine.International human rights law also continues to be violated in the civil, political, economic, social, cultural and religious domains in the occupied areas. Violations are targeted towards persons belonging to any minority group or organization that dissents from the views of the Government of the Russian Federation — mostly Ukrainian activists, Crimean Tatars and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. According to the recent report of the Secretary-General on the human rights situation in Crimea (A/74/276), arbitrary arrests, house raids, groundless detentions, harassment, intimidation, unfair trials, degrading treatment of detainees, torture, sexual violence and other violations remain systematic and unpunished. Those violations must stop immediately. All persons detained illegally must be released. And international human rights monitoring mechanisms, including the International Committee of the Red Cross and non-governmental organizations, must be given access to the annexed and occupied territories.","I would like to begin by thanking Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo, Ms. Heidi Grau and Mr. Halit Çevik for their briefings. On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the Minsk agreements, Indonesia would like to highlight the following three points.First, we must uphold respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. Indonesia reaffirms its principled and consistent position that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States are fundamental principles of relations among nations, including in Ukraine. Indonesia is therefore against any actions of annexation of any sovereign country or territory. That is a clear violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.Secondly, there must be full adherence to, and implementation of, the Minsk agreements, which constitute the legal basis for achieving a political solution and provide a road map for settling the conflict in Ukraine. Indonesia supports the full implementation of the agreements, in line with the purposes and principles of the Charter. We encourage the relevant stakeholders to uphold those commitments fully. That will be a crucial confidence-booster to ultimately pave the way for a political solution and restore peace and stability in the affected areas.Indonesia also takes note of the work carried out by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Trilateral Contact Group in the implementation of the agreements. We call on all parties to immediately cease hostilities and commit to fully respecting the ceasefire and refraining from provocations that could lead to more tension. In line with the Minsk agreements, the parties should refrain from actions that could be viewed as provocative and further impede a peaceful resolution.Thirdly, conflicts must be peacefully settled. Indonesia reiterates its call on all the parties concerned to exercise the utmost restraint, manage the crisis responsibly, promote a peaceful settlement and uphold respect for international law. We call on them to achieve a comprehensive and balanced solution through dialogue, as stipulated in Article 33 of the Charter. In doing so, Indonesia encourages the States concerned to take necessary measures to de-escalate tensions. We are against any actions that exacerbate hostilities and deteriorate the already fragile situation on the ground.Let me end by reiterating that Indonesia will fully support all constructive efforts aimed at resolving the conflict in Ukraine peacefully, in accordance with international law and Charter principles. We once again urge a peaceful solution to the crisis in Ukraine according to the relevant Security Council resolutions and the agreements signed by the parties involved.","Allow me, through you, Madam President, to sincerely thank Ms. DiCarlo as well as the other two briefers, who joined our meeting today via video-teleconference. I would also like to welcome the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to today’s meeting.The Security Council was briefed on 6 February on the current priorities of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) (see S/PV.8714), including achieving tangible results in conflict and post-conflict environments. To that end, special attention was paid to the crisis in Ukraine, which remains the most pressing security issue in Europe. Although the conflict threatens peace and security, it also has an impact on the daily lives of civilians, in particular as it pertains to the freedom of movement and the humanitarian situation.As in other crisis-affected areas, the humanitarian situation, including the plight of women and children, deserves special attention. Financial resources must therefore be mobilized in order to meet the needs of the most vulnerable segments of the population. Allow me to commend the efforts of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the European External Action Service and the United Nations Development Programme to bring about tangible improvements on the ground in an effort to assist those in need.The 2015 Minsk agreements marked a turning point in the crisis in Ukraine, as they reflected the willingness of the parties to reach a consensus-based solution. It is for that reason that the Niger supports all measures to implement the agreements, which were endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 2202 (2015), of 17 February 2015. We call on the parties to fully implement those agreements and demonstrate political will in order to create the right conditions for peace. We also welcome the resumption of the dialogue within the framework of the Normandy format, following the summit held in Paris on 9 December 2019, whose conclusions should be welcomed. The efforts made by the Trilateral Contact Group should also be supported. We encourage the OSCE to intensify its efforts to effectively monitor and verify the ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons, in accordance with the agreements I just mentioned.In conclusion, as in other hotspots, the parties must work to find not a military solution, but a political one — the only kind of any value.","I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Belgium.Five years after the signing of the Minsk agreements, the implementation of their key provisions remains a dead letter, which is reflected in a deterioration of the humanitarian and human rights situation on the ground. We therefore call on the parties to implement the Minsk agreements rapidly and fully and to honour their commitments.We support the efforts made both in the Normandy format and in the framework of the Trilateral Contact Group. We welcome the conclusions of the meeting in the Normandy format held in Paris on 9 December 2019 and look forward to a continued and deepened dialogue. In order for those efforts to fully bear fruit, it is essential that a lasting ceasefire be put in place. In that regard, we are particularly concerned about the most recent escalation of violence and call for the utmost restraint.We regret that the parties, in particular Russia, continue to obstruct the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine in its monitoring and reporting tasks. We strongly encourage both sides to respect the mandate of the Mission and to allow it safe and unhindered access to all Ukrainian territory, including the territories bordering Ukraine and Russia, as well as the Crimea.We are deeply concerned about the impact of the conflict on human rights, including the right to life, the right to liberty and non-discrimination, in particular with regard to internally displaced persons. We call for free and confidential access for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and other international observers to all places of detention in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic.The statistic of the 3.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance reminds us that the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine requires our attention. We urge all parties to allow full access in accordance with humanitarian principles. We are deeply concerned about the targeting of critical civilian infrastructure, such as water and sanitation facilities, as well as schools. In that regard, we welcome the endorsement by the Government of Ukraine of the Safe Schools Declaration, which demonstrates its commitment to protecting education in times of armed conflict.We remain deeply concerned about reports of the presence of Russian military equipment and personnel in areas controlled by armed formations. The presence of heavy weapons, which is contrary to the Minsk agreements, continues to be a threat to the civilian population on both sides of the line of contact. We call for a complete withdrawal of those weapons as well as the disengagement of troops from the designated areas. As eastern Ukraine is one of the most mine-contaminated areas in the world, we call for further efforts to demarcate and mark contaminated areas, as well as for mine clearance, especially in the vicinity of schools and entry and exit points. We are concerned about the underfunding of the humanitarian response plan and call on the international community to engage more actively in this area.In conclusion, we call on all parties to work towards a lasting solution to this conflict, based on respect for the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.I now resume my functions as President of the Council.I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine.","We begin by joining the members of the Council in welcoming all our briefers today and extend our gratitude to them for their informative briefings. We note the presence of the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines continues to stand steadfast in its advocacy of and adherence to the immutable principles of international law. These are the foundational truths upon which our international community is built and within which small States like ours are able to exist. To deviate from these principles would be an assault on the rights and privileges of all States, and we deplore any action to this effect.We express our concern about the current situation in the Donbas region. International law cannot be sporadically applied or set aside in the pursuit of convenient or expedient solutions. Its application must be equal. To that end, we underscore the relevant international principles as the guiding tools in the resolution of the crisis, including the Minsk agreements.Recently, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines emphasized its support for the Minsk agreements, as we expressed our hope for the full implementation under the auspices of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group. The tenets outlined in the Minsk agreements are necessary for lasting peace. We highlight the importance of the ceasefire in achieving that and deplore all violations of this measure. The ceasefire remains an indispensable component of the agreements.We take this opportunity to recognize recent efforts that have been made, particularly as they relate to confidence-building measures. Trust between and among relevant parties is crucial to strengthening our dialogue and achieving a sustainable solution. Continued prisoner exchanges must be encouraged, as should efforts towards identifying further areas of disengagement.We are also encouraged by the fact that the Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (SMM) of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has recorded fewer ceasefire violations in some areas. We welcome the work of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, which continues to observe security across the region and report on the situation. In order to facilitate the Mission in the discharge of its mandate, we emphasize the need for safe and secure access for its staff on the ground, including unrestricted movement of SMM personnel.In conclusion, we emphasize our support for the Special Monitoring Mission and the framework established by the Minsk agreements, and stress the need for the unconditional implementation by both parties of the provisions therein.","I thank Belgium for facilitating today’s discussion on the letter from the Russian Federation dated 13 April 2014 (S/2014/264). We would also like to thank the briefers for their informative briefings.Five years have passed since the signing of the Minsk agreements. While there have recently been some encouraging developments, such as the meetings of the Normandy Four, the full implementation of all the provisions of the agreements has yet to be realized. My delegation commends the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for its efforts in Ukraine as it diligently executes its mandate in monitoring the implementation of the 2015 Minsk agreements, endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 2202 (2015).The OSCE has also been successful in facilitating dialogue between the parties in seeking a resolution to the situation. In that regard, it is important that the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine be allowed unhindered access to monitor and verify compliance with the Minsk agreements, in line with its mandate. It remains necessary for all parties to fully implement all their respective commitments under the Minsk agreements. We must stress that the Minsk agreements, including the package of measures, provide the most promising road map for peace in the long term.It is clear from the briefings that we heard this afternoon that there remains an urgent need for the immediate cessation of hostilities in eastern Ukraine. The continued violations of the ceasefire and the increased tensions due to the presence of heavy weapons and their use, in violation of the Minsk agreements, are of serious concern. The ongoing tensions and conflict have negatively impacted the humanitarian situation on the ground.We call for the urgent de-escalation of tensions to allow for a situation that is conducive to the alleviation of the humanitarian crisis and the delivery of aid to those most in need. We also encourage the parties to refrain from actions that could be viewed as provocative and aimed at exacerbating tensions. Such actions place obstacles in the path of meaningful dialogue and may further impede a peaceful resolution of the situation in line with the Minsk agreements.Let me conclude by reiterating my country’s position on the need for compromise and dialogue. South Africa will continue to encourage the parties to strengthen all diplomatic efforts to produce a sustainable and peaceful solution. In that regard, we wish to re-emphasize the importance and welcome the recent and upcoming meetings of the Normandy Four countries. We encourage all efforts, including the increased role of the Normandy Four, to facilitate ongoing initiatives to build trust in seeking a long-term, peaceful and sustainable solution to the situation in Ukraine. ","At the outset, my delegation would like to thank Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo, Ms. Heidi Grau and Ambassador Halit Çevik for their valuable briefings. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome His Excellency Mr. Sergiy Kyslytsya, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. We hope that this meeting, which coincides with the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Minsk agreements, will contribute to more efforts to advance a peaceful settlement in eastern Ukraine and to end the crisis through negotiations.In his briefing to the Security Council two weeks ago (see S/PV.8714), the Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) addressed the crisis in eastern Ukraine. At that meeting, Tunisia expressed its commitment to all efforts aimed at strengthening international peace and security. Given our adherence to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, Tunisia today stresses once again our steadfast position based on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and non-interference in their internal affairs. Those are fundamental elements of peaceful relations among States. In that context, my delegation asserts its support for the efforts of all parties concerned to reach a comprehensive solution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine through dialogue and negotiations, in accordance with Article 33 of the Charter and the Minsk agreements, particularly within the Normandy Four and the Trilateral Contact Group, and based on resolution 2202 (2015).My country’s delegation wishes to commend the positive developments registered throughout 2019, including the meeting of the Normandy Four in Paris in December, the prisoner exchange process in September, progress made in the negotiations, the establishment of new disengagement areas and the opening of new crossing points along the line of contact. Those positive steps contribute to paving the way towards a peaceful settlement of the crisis and to alleviating the suffering of the population concerned. We call for those positive developments to be built upon in order to ensure that conditions do not regress into a cycle of violence, especially given the concerns expressed in the briefings about violence and the number of casualties.My country’s delegation reiterates the important role of the OSCE in advancing efforts to resolve the crisis. We express our appreciation and support for the efforts of the Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, within the framework of its mandate, to monitor and report on the security situation, facilitate dialogue to reduce tension and enhance confidence-building measures. My delegation also appreciates the continued work of the Trilateral Contact Group and its various working teams, and reiterates its call for a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire while fully implementing the Minsk agreements, as well as respect of all parties for their commitments under those agreements.Amid the continued momentum in the ongoing peace efforts, my delegation hopes to see improvement in the humanitarian situation through the concerted efforts of all parties to provide assistance and protection to the population in the areas concerned, including such basic needs as health care and services, food security and education in the areas close to the line of contact and elsewhere, based on the report issued by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, especially in light of the shortage of financing for the humanitarian response plan.In conclusion, in the context of the growing challenges to international peace and security, I emphasize once again my delegation’s hope to see acceleration in the implementation of all concluded agreements and the outcomes of follow-up meetings with a view to reach a comprehensive peace settlement to the crisis in eastern Ukraine. That will contribute to restoring stability and strengthening the elements of regional security and prosperity for the peoples of the region.","At the outset, I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo, Her Excellency Ms. Heidi Grau and His Excellency Mr. Halit Çevik for their insightful briefings on the implementation of resolution 2202 (2015), the Minsk agreements and the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine. I would also like to welcome His Excellency the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to today’s meeting.Over the past few months, we have seen encouraging signs of progress on issues related to the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine. A number of detained persons associated with the conflict were released in prisoner exchanges. After a long standstill, the Normandy format meeting held on 9 December 2019 enabled the successful resumption of communication processes at the highest level. We would like to commend the great efforts of the Normandy Four leaders, as well as their commitment to a sustainable and inclusive architecture of trust and security in Europe. I look forward to forthcoming meetings.Meanwhile, the situation on the ground in the region is still of serious concern. Incidents, including armed hostilities, occur every day in that part of Europe. The conflict continues to cause death, injuries, displacement, shelter destruction and the lack of basic living conditions for millions of civilians — many of whom are elderly, women and children.We hope that the momentum for stabilization and de-escalation will continue, with the aim of moving further towards a peaceful settlement to the situation, in accordance with international law, the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant Security Council resolutions. In that regard, we call for greater efforts to fully implement the Minsk agreements. We also look forward to the concrete implementation of a comprehensive ceasefire regime, the development and implementation of additional disengagement areas and an updated mine clearance plan, among other measures. We urge the parties to explore further trust-building steps by promoting dialogue and negotiations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S/PV.8575,16/07/2019,Briefing the Security Council om the topic of Ukrainian elections and on the rights of ethnic minorities in Ukraine,"I thank Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo and High Commissioner Zannier for their briefings. China has always held an objective and impartial position on the issue of Ukraine. We respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, including Ukraine. China believes that all the parties concerned should fully implement resolution 2202 (2015) and the new Minsk agreements, remain committed to the overall direction of political settlement and actively seek a comprehensive, lasting and balanced solution to the Ukrainian issue. The situation in Ukraine involves both complex historical and contemporary factors. China supports the parties concerned in their efforts to resolve their relevant differences quickly through dialogue and negotiations on the basis of taking into account and accommodating the legitimate concerns of all regions and ethnic groups in Ukraine so as to reach a final settlement that is acceptable to all parties. The Security Council should play a constructive role and create a favourable external environment for the proper settlement of relevant issues, advancing peace, stability and development in Ukraine, promoting harmony among its various ethnic communities and enhancing peaceful coexistence between Ukraine and other countries in the region. ","I thank Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo and Mr. Lamberto Zannier for their briefings on the difficult situation Ukraine is facing due to a conflict that has, lest we forget, claimed more than 13,000 lives. That situation is not the result of the adoption, on 25 April, of the law on the use of Ukrainian as a national language. The law is in no way a threat to international peace and security. It is up to the Ukrainians to make their own choices regarding linguistic policies, inter alia, while respecting their European and international commitments. The early parliamentary elections to be held next Sunday will contribute to that. Nevertheless, the multiple violations of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity since 2014 are a source of great concern and a threat to international peace and security. I wish to take this opportunity to reaffirm France’s commitment to the territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. France does not and will not recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea. I also reiterate France’s condemnation of Russia’s decision to facilitate the granting of Russian citizenship to Ukrainian citizens living in certain areas of the oblasts of Donetsk and Luhansk. By doing so, Russia is deliberately undermining the spirit of the Minsk agreements. As we commemorate the fifth anniversary of the tragic downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the 298 victims. They deserve the truth, to have the perpetrators identified and justice to be delivered in accordance with resolution 2166 (2014). Furthermore, France once again calls for the release of the 24 Ukrainian seamen captured during the naval incident in the Kerch Strait in November, as was also demanded by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in May. I would now like to underscore two points. First, there have been some positive developments in recent weeks and days. Under the leadership of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi, the work of the Trilateral Contact Group resumed in a constructive manner as of 5 June. Again, at the initiative of the new Ukrainian authorities, the disengagement of forces in the pilot zone in Stanytsia Luhanska was implemented on 30 June. That is a significant step forward in terms of security and is paving the way for improvements in the humanitarian situation. I would also like to commend the resumption of bilateral contacts at the highest level between Ukraine and Russia, crystallized by an initial telephone exchange between the President of Ukraine and the President of the Russian Federation on 11 July. My second point is that it is now necessary to create momentum, on the basis of those first positive developments, that generates the trust that is indispensable for the settlement of the conflict. We bear a responsibility to the 3.5 million people who suffer daily as a result of the conflict. That is why France, alongside Germany, remains firmly committed to the Normandy format. France hosted a meeting of diplomatic advisers under that format on 12 July in Paris, marking the resumption of the proceedings and resulting in encouraging constructive exchanges. A set of priority measures to be taken by the parties in the coming weeks was agreed upon. It is now their responsibility to ensure that they be translated into concrete actions. It is also particularly necessary to make rapid progress in terms of prisoner exchanges, the last of which took place in December 2017, a ceasefire that is genuinely respected, improving the humanitarian situation, the withdrawal of heavy weaponry and mine clearance. Once the necessary legal framework has been established, democratic local elections will make it possible to implement the decentralization provisions provided for by the Minsk agreements. To conclude, allow me to call for all of us here to be vigilant. Although encouraging, recent developments remain fragile. Current circumstances offer an opportunity to generate new, more positive and constructive momentum to revive the peace process. It is incumbent upon us all to seize the opportunity by taking the demanding path of dialogue and cooperation. The Minsk agreements will soon be 5 years old — it is high time that they be finally implemented. ","We thank the Peruvian presidency for convening today’s meeting. I would like to begin by saying that we absolutely agree with the fact that protecting and promoting the language of a titular nation is the responsibility of all States, including Ukraine. We do not object to the Ukrainian language, which, incidentally, is understood, loved and respected in Russia. However, we speak in defence of the Russian language. The biased Ukrainian authorities have adopted draconian medieval methods to eradicate it. They have banned communication in Russian in the majority of public spaces, which is at variance with all conventions protecting the interests of national minorities and basic human rights. It defies common sense and the basic norms of civilized conduct. Let us take an example from an interview with Mr. Mykyta Poturaev, a candidate for the Verkhovna Rada and adviser to the President of Ukraine on political issues. In it, he proposes that the Russian language be renamed “Rossian” and that Russia be renamed “Moskovia”. He also proposed that the Russian language be used as a weapon against our country. In anticipation of the question we will certainly hear today, how is the language issue relevant to the Security Council’s agenda? It is directly related to its agenda. The document signed by former President Poroshenko on 15 May is a direct violation of the letter and spirit of the package of measures for the fulfilment of the Minsk agreements, approved by resolution 2202 (2015). We should all therefore provide a principled and impartial assessment of the of the new Ukrainian law. I hope that all of our colleagues can resist the temptation to shield Kyiv from the warranted criticism resulting from the adoption of that law and devote our meeting with other topics. Let us recall that the main provisions of the document, which provides for the most brutal forced Ukrainization of all spheres of public life and gradually introduces fines for failing to use the Ukrainian language, enter into force today. The Russian-speaking citizens of the country will be stripped of an opportunity to be educated in their native language, including in universities and schools. I will not repeat myself today and give specific examples from the text of the law. I already did so on 20 May (see S/PV.8529). Since then neither we nor the Russian-speaking residents of the country have had any reason to adopt a different approach to it. The issue is not an internal matter in Ukraine. We categorically reject that interpretation. For those who genuinely understand recent Ukrainian history, it is clear that the issue of linguistic and cultural identity lies at the heart of the tragic fracture that the country has endured since the Maidan coup d’état of 2014. The threat to ban Russian as an official language in the south-east was voiced by the Maidan representatives who seized power. That, in turn, led to internal divisions and confrontations, which have resulted in the current ongoing crisis and territorial division. Accordingly, if there is no resolution to the problem in the spirit of public consensus and harmony, there can be no genuine progress towards cohesion and, as a consequence, there can be no end to the domestic fratricidal conflict in eastern Ukraine. Those who attempt to defend the actions of the Maidan authorities claim that such action is geared towards supporting the State language as it pertains to the issue of languages of national minorities. That also includes Russian- speaking Ukrainians. It might appear logical but any objective expert on Ukraine would confirm that in that country such an approach is hardly applicable. The Russian-speaking citizens of Ukraine are not a national minority in the traditional sense of the term. In spite of official Maidan statistics, according to which the Russian language is allegedly no longer spoken in Ukraine, all other sources and surveys show that Russian remains the native or preferred language of communication for the majority of Ukraine’s population. According to the American analytics company Gallup, in the late 2000s 83 per cent of respondents in Ukraine said that Russian was their preferred language and an extremely important subject taught to children in school. Google search engine results revealed in 2014 that more than 90 per cent of search queries from Ukraine were made in the Russian language. Even the staunchest Maidan propagandists are forced to admit that, for at least 25 per cent of Ukrainian residents, Russian is the native language. Do those statistics not make it clear that restrictive and punitive measures against the Russian language in that country, at the very least, stoke divisions and social confrontation? Incidentally, the new Ukrainian authorities, which received support from 75 per cent of Ukrainians during the most recent presidential elections, from the very beginning expressed doubts about the rectitude of the policy of the forced Ukrainization of the country and the formation of what is virtually a language inquisition. The new President, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, and his team repeatedly made it clear that after the formation of a new Ukrainian Parliament they intended to scrutinize the ineligibility of the law on Ukraine’s State language. The Parliament of Ukraine — the Verkhovna Rada — also has several questions about the law. On 21 June, parliamentarians registered a petition with the Constitutional Court of Ukraine with respect to the law on Ukraine’s State language, as it is at odds with the Constitution, violates the right of citizens to use their native language and, consequently, creates an atmosphere of intolerance in the society. And just today, in the Verkhovna Rada, a bill was registered to repeal the language law, which violates the Council of Europe’s Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Under those circumstances, a great deal today depends upon us. Council members can either play into the hands of the Maidan politicians, who have discredited themselves, headed by former President Poroshenko, and pretend that the law on the State language should be adopted quietly and without criticism, or they can send a clear message that the struggle for the preservation of national and cultural identity should not devolve into the violation of the rights of the Russian-speaking population in Ukraine. In particular, former President Poroshenko recently stated that so long as Mr. Zelenskyi speaks Russian, the country is in danger. Threats to him in that regard were repeatedly made by other so-called nationalist Maidan activists. There is no consensus on the language issue in Ukraine. The adoption of the law on language was a purely political decision that failed to reflect the opinion of the Ukrainian population, the current situation in the country and the unique features of the multinational Ukrainian society. In order not to fuel such a distorted and dangerous mindset for Ukraine, we propose that we send a clear message today about the Council’s support for unity and cohesion among Ukrainians, instead of divisions. That is the only way that we, together, not in words but in deed, can demonstrate our shared commitment to the Minsk agreements, with which Ukraine categorically refuses to comply. I should indeed like to comment on the remarks made by certain colleagues in their statements. I will begin with my friend, Ambassador Heusgen. I do not know who told him what I said, but the way he interpreted my statement makes it clear that it was restated in an inaccurate manner. I can repeat my statement for him personally later, should he so wish. However, I will not dignify my British colleague with a response to his numerous questions. This is due not to a lack of respect for my colleague, but to the simple fact that he does not need these responses. He lives within his own paradigm and those questions he has put forward are, for him, rhetorical. They also contain the responses that he wishes to hear and therefore he has no need for other answers. Incidentally, I have proposed that my British colleague visit Crimea personally and take a look at the so-called suffering of Crimeans, including Crimean Tatars, so that he can draw his own conclusions, rather than read out the narrative that is duly provided to him by the British Foreign Office. Incidentally, in Crimea it would be possible to familiarize oneself with the educational system in three State languages: Russian, Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar, which our American colleague was so concerned about today. Not a word, however, was said about the topic of today’s meeting and in no way did he even comment on the words of the High Commissioner on National Minorities, who indeed provided a great deal of interesting information. We assumed that a number of Council members would do everything possible to avoid discussion of the topic at hand today. They raised many issues, but not what we proposed to be put forward for discussion. This is truly no surprise to us. We have long attempted to convey to the Council that the picture members are painting in their imagination, which is duly being delivered to them by the Ukrainian authorities about freedom-loving, democratic Ukraine engaged in an uneven struggle with a brutal aggressor, has nothing to do with reality. They do not see that the reality of the situation is, in fact, straight out of their imagination or rather the myth that they have created for themselves; more accurately, perhaps they simply do not wish to see it. They do not wish to understand that their indulgence towards Kyiv prompts a feeling of lawlessness, all-permissiveness and impunity. They do not wish to hear that what is really happening in Ukraine is the enmity and hostility being cultivated in society vis-à-vis Russia. I will offer three brief examples to illustrate that. The Ukrainian television channel News One announced a television broadcast and a link with Russia One. Ordinary citizens, not politicians, were tracked to an unprecedented level by nationalists with the connivance of the authorities. Information surfaced yesterday that the general producer of the channel was questioned by the Ukrainian security forces as part of “a criminal affair on encroachment upon on a state offence or treason” — all this for an attempt to set up a television broadcast. The building of the Ukrainian channel 112 Ukraine was fired on with mortars in the centre of Kyiv for its plans to screen the documentary Revealing Ukraine, by Oliver Stone, a well-known United States director. This mortar attack was denounced by the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine, who claimed that a war was being waged in Ukraine against journalists and mass media. Dmytro Yarosh, the former head of the Right Sector party and a deputy from the outgoing Rada, recommended that workers of television channels quit and that all those concerned about violations of human rights and freedom of speech should shut their mouth. Kyrill Vyshinsky, head of RIA Novosti Ukraine, has been behind bars for a year now. He is accused of State treason for some reports he delivered. These instances and examples abound. I can list many, but members of the Council — at least, many of them — simply do not wish to hear it. We regret the fact that some have been unable to resist the temptation to use today’s meeting in order to capitalize on the sensitive issue of the disaster of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in Ukraine in July 2014. On the eve of the fifth anniversary of this tragedy, we once again extend our most sincere condolences to the families of the dead. We believe that every family deserves to know the truth about what really occurred on that unfortunate day. For that reason, from the very beginning we have called for a thorough and impartial international investigation in line with resolution 2166 (2014) and have repeatedly stressed our willingness to join and to deliver the necessary support. Unfortunately, we cannot trust the actions of the Joint Investigation Team, which is comprised of Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Malaysia and Ukraine itself, to be impartial. Questions regarding the proceedings of the work surfaced right after four out of five States, on 7 August 2014, signed a confidential agreement that enabled the filtering of any information. Malaysia had long been denied an opportunity to fully participate in the investigation. I do not know whether the Council has heard that the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, at a meeting with journalists on 30 May, cast doubt on the outcomes or the result of the work of the group. We concur with his opinion that there is an impression that the purpose of the investigation is not to shed light on the circumstances of what took place but rather to pin all blame on the Russian Federation. Incidentally, I am surprised that the statement delivered by my friend Ambassador Heusgen, who referred to international law and demonstrated an incredible level of legal nihilism, calling upon the Russian Federation to pay compensation for the victims when there have been no judicial proceedings and no one has yet been identified as the culprit. I wish to recall the fact that, in October 2016, we conveyed the initial unredacted radar data and remain the only ones to have done so. Regarding flight MH-17, I would like to ask our United States colleague about the whereabouts of the satellite images from United States satellites over the crash site that have long been spoken of and which the United States has refused to provide. At a recent press conference, on 19 June, the representatives of the Joint Investigation Team were unable to answer the question of why Russian data was not taken into account but the data of other countries was not even provided, just as they were unable to say why they had disregarded the fact that the rocket that allegedly downed the Boeing had come from the Ukrainian armed forces, when that fact had been established by the Russian side after the Joint Investigation Team itself displayed fragments of that rocket. The politicization of this Group is to us completely evident. I will not speak in depth about the incident in the Kerch Strait. I would simply say — I do not know whether Council members are aware of this or not — that Russia proposed releasing those sailors to return to Ukraine provided that they consented to participate in criminal proceedings to take place in the Russian Federation. This idea was immediately rejected by Ukraine’s Foreign Minister and, by the way, subsequently questioned and called into doubt by President Zelenskyi. I will not talk about that, but I will read out a single quotation about how the day before the inauguration of the President, the former Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration, Andriy Portnov, filed a complaint with the State Bureau of Investigation in relation to actions by former President Poroshenko in connection with that incident: “The aforementioned instances were the result of planned illegal actions by an individual who at the time occupied the post of President of Ukraine and was the senior military commander of the country’s armed forces. In other words, as part of an organized group of individuals having full information about the tensions in the Kerch Strait, aware of the likelihood the Russian Federation’s armed forces would undertake aggressive action, and fully understanding the risks to the life, health and freedom of Ukrainian servicemen as well as potential damages and loss of military equipment and weapons stemming from his actions, President Poroshenko deliberately instructed or consented to the instruction ordering a group of naval vessels belonging to the Ukrainian armed forces to be transferred from the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov through the Kerch Strait, which was fully under the control of the Russian naval forces.” In conclusion, I wish to tell my Ukrainian colleague the following. My Ukrainian colleague used the well- known tactic of twisting notions that the Ukrainian side has long favoured. It is as if he were not at the meeting commemorating the Minsk agreements when the question concerning the presence of Russian troops in Donbas was answered, not by us but by the representatives of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. We remember very well what they said in this regard. Nevertheless, the Ukrainian side is obstinately using the term “Russian militants”. They can of course be Russian — there are many Russians in Ukraine — but they are in fact representatives of the Donbas region and not of the Russian Federation. Incidentally, he forgot to mention how many civilians in Donbas, Luhansk and Donetsk died as a result of the shelling by the valiant and knightly Ukrainian forces. I wish to stress that these were civilians. I would like to reiterate for the Council’s understanding that it was not Donbas that marched on Kyiv, but Kyiv that came to Donbas. I will not continue to describe the way Ukraine has been sabotaging the Minsk agreements. Earlier, the representative of Ukraine proposed measures that need to be adopted to begin to resolve the conflict, but he spoke to the Russian side, again resorting to the tactic of twisting notions. We have said, we are saying and we will continue to say that until the Ukrainian side engages in direct dialogue with representatives of Donetsk and Luhansk — not with Russia — there will be no progress in this conflict. I have asked this many times in this Chamber: Why is it that when we discuss other conflicts that have unfortunately engulfed the world — the Syrian, Yemeni or Libyan conflicts, or indeed any other conflict — we call on the parties to the conflict to sit down at the negotiating table and we do not allege that external players supplant those parties to the conflict. It is only in the case of Ukraine that many Council members are obstinately attempting to make Russia speak to Ukraine rather than to those individuals in Donbas, Donetsk and Luhansk who are the direct parties to this confrontation. Lastly, the representative of Ukraine mentioned that we are instructing the Ukrainians on what language needs to be spoken in Ukraine. We are not giving any such instructions. This is Ukraine’s law, which instructs its citizens as to what languages they are allowed to speak and what languages they are not allowed to speak. ","I thank Mr. Zannier for his briefing. When the Security Council decided not to hold a meeting on this issue on the day of President Zelenskyi’s inauguration, the Russian Ambassador accused the Council of censorship. Well, there is no censorship. Here we are debating the issue. Back then, Russia was offered any other date it wanted, but it insisted that we had to meet on inauguration day. Which country around this table would not think that unnecessary, provocative and disrespectful if proposed in its region? We are now at this meeting, as we said then that we would be, discussing Ukraine, and there should be no censorship. That is why I was surprised not to hear the Russian Ambassador explain why Russia continues to arm separatists in eastern Ukraine, why Russia refuses to implement the Minsk agreements, why it continues to illegally detained 24 Ukrainian servicemen or why it persecutes the Tatar community in illegally annexed Crimea. Those are the issues that warrant continued discussion around this table. Let me address Ukraine’s policy on State language. It is important that we do so in the context of Russia’s continued attempts to undermine Ukraine’s independence. We reject the tenuous link Russia was drawn between the language law and the Minsk agreements, and call on Russia to live up to its responsibility to uphold international peace and security by implementing its Minsk commitments. As we have heard, the bill on ensuring the functioning of Ukrainian as the State language, which was adopted by the Ukrainian Parliament on 25 April, is designed to reinforce the role of the Ukrainian language in public life. We note that the law requires the Ukrainian Parliament to pass further legislation on the realization of the rights of indigenous peoples and national minorities of Ukraine. We welcome the fact that the law requires the Ukrainian Parliament to pass further legislation to protect the rights of indigenous peoples and national minorities. Of course, we expect Ukraine to comply with its international obligations, including with respect to the Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. I agree with Mr. Zannier that the language law should unite, not divide, a diverse society. Ukrainians continue to suffer as a result of the Russian-fuelled conflict. Almost 13,000 people have lost their lives. Russia denies providing weaponry and personnel, but if it has nothing to hide, why does Russia and the separatists it backs block access for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to the Ukraine-Russia border outside Ukrainian Government control? And why has Russia still failed to provide any explanation for the shooting down of a long-range unmanned aerial vehicle belonging to the Special Monitoring Mission in October last year on the border outside Ukrainian Government control? We call on Russia to play its part in ensuring that the security and humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine is resolved. Three months ago, the day after President Zelenskyi’s overwhelming democratic election, Russia decided to make it easier for Ukrainian citizens living in eastern Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship. That howed a clear disregard for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and runs counter to the spirit and objectives of the Minsk agreements. The United Kingdom supports the European Union’s readiness to respond to that, including through the non-recognition of Russian passports issued in contradiction to the Minsk agreements. And I recall that it was on the pretext of protecting Russian citizens that Russia invaded Georgia. It is important that there be no such plan for Ukraine. The United Kingdom welcomes President Zelenskyi’s efforts to address the Ukraine crisis and stands ready to support his efforts to improve the humanitarian situation and bring peace to Donbas. We also continue to support the efforts of our partners with the Minsk process and are prepared to assist further as required. All parties have responsibilities under the Minsk agreements, and we expect to see the withdrawal of Russian personnel and weaponry supplied to Russian-backed separatists and the safe access, delivery and distribution of humanitarian assistance to those in need. I welcome the information provided to us by Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo about some of the recent improvements in that regard. The situation in illegally annexed Crimea is desperate. We deplore the continued persecution of the Crimean Tatars, including the arbitrary arrest of 24 individuals in Simferopol in March. We call on Russia to immediately release all political prisoners and allow unrestricted access for human rights monitoring organizations. We further call on Russia to immediately release the 24 Ukrainian naval servicemen detained since 25 November, in line with the ruling of 25 May of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. Tomorrow marks the fifth anniversary of the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, which resulting in the tragic deaths of the 298 people on board. The family and friends of those who died deserve justice. We welcome the indictment of four individuals accused of perpetrating those attacks, and we urge Russia to fully cooperate with the prosecution in accordance with resolution 2166 (2014). The day after President Zelenskyi was overwhelmingly democratically elected, Russia introduced its new passport law. On the day President Zelenskyi was inaugurated, Russia tried and failed to hold a Security Council meeting to distract attention. Instead of that aggression, why does Russia not engage with President Zelenskyi and lower tensions rather than stoke them in eastern Ukraine and withdraw from Ukrainian territory? We want to engage in constructive dialogue with Russia on the issues that matter. But it is a matter of deep regret that, through its actions, Russia continues to violate the rules, norms and international law that we around this table are tasked with upholding. I urge Russia to choose an alternative path to the one it pursues today. But until it does, the international community must stand resolute in its opposition to Russia’s continued attempts to destabilize and undermine Ukraine. ","The support of the United States for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering. We are committed to working with the Ukrainian people to promote democracy and prosperity and root out corruption. President Trump underscored that message to President Zelenskyi following peaceful competitive elections that reflected Ukraine’s vibrant democracy. Russia’s actions in Ukraine since 2014 have led to approximately 13,000 conflict-related deaths, including more than 300 Ukrainian soldiers killed or wounded this year in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which was stirred up by Russia. In the face of Russia’s aggression and efforts to undermine the country, Ukraine instead continues to grow more united, more cohesive, more resilient and stronger. We welcome the opportunity today to discuss issues that Ukraine’s minority groups face. Since 2014, Russian occupation forces have carried out a campaign of violence, including dozens of extrajudicial killings and forcible disappearances, imprisonment and torture, against Crimean Tatars, ethnic Ukrainians and others. We call on Russia to end its systematic abuse of Ukraine’s Crimean Tatar community and Ukrainian nationals in Crimea and the Donbas region. We note with concern Russia’s suppression of education in the languages of national minorities in Crimea. Only 249 schoolchildren are being educated in the Ukrainian language this year, down from 12,694 children in the school year before Russia’s occupation began, according to data gathered by the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. In contrast, we commend President Zelenskyi’s support for the promotion of Ukrainian language efforts to promote national unity. While President Zelenskyi has promised to take steps to strengthen relations between Kyiv and Ukrainians living in eastern Ukraine, Russia perpetually undermines unity, as exemplified recently by its decision to issue passports to Ukrainians residing in conflict areas. Sombrely, we note that, five years ago tomorrow, 298 innocent civilians were killed in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. The United States again extends its deepest sympathies to the families and friends of the victims and calls for justice on behalf of those who lost their lives. As the findings of the Joint Investigation Team made clear, the BUK missile launcher used to bring down the passenger aircraft was owned by Russia and was assigned to Russia’s 53rd Anti-aircraft Brigade. The launcher was brought into sovereign Ukrainian territory, fired from territory controlled by Russia and Russian-led forces in eastern Ukraine and then returned to Russian territory. We recall the Security Council’s demand that those responsible be held to account and that all States cooperate fully with efforts to establish accountability. We call upon Russia to respect and adhere to resolution 2166 (2014) and ensure that any indicted individuals currently in Russia face justice. More recently, Russia escalated its aggressive activities when it blocked the lawful passage of Ukrainian naval vessels and attacked them near the Kerch Strait in November. The United States calls on Russia to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, including its territorial waters, and we reiterate our call to Russia to immediately release the detained Ukrainian crew members and naval vessels. That would be an important demonstration of Russia’s readiness to engage more constructively with Ukraine. Russia must end its occupation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula. Our Crimea-related sanctions will remain in place until Russia returns control of the peninsula to Ukraine, and our sanctions against Russia for its aggression in eastern Ukraine will remain in place until Russia fully implements the Minsk agreements. As Secretary Pompeo stated in our declaration on Crimea last year, the United States rejects Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea and pledges to maintain that policy until Ukraine’s territorial integrity is restored. ",,,,,,,,,,,"First of all, I thank the members of the Security Council, as well as the briefers, for their remarks. We have taken good note of them.Nearly two months ago, on 20 May, the Security Council clearly stated its position on the Russian request to discuss Ukraine’s language law by rejecting it (see S/PV.8529). At that time, the Russian representative, however, demonstrated outrageous disrespect for the Council’s rules and its members by abusing its right to speak in explanation of vote and delivering a lengthy statement on substance.Now Russia yet again wants to talk about Ukraine’s law on the functioning of Ukrainian as the State language, as if it might threaten international peace and security and as if there were no more important issue on the Council agenda. In fact, this matter has no relation whatsoever to international peace and security and has nothing to do with the implementation of resolution 2202 (2015).On 22 May, I sent a letter to the Council with a detailed argumentation of the issue, contained in document S/2019/422, which I cite for the convenience of Council members. I just want to stress the following.A country that, for centuries, suppressed the Ukrainian language and forcefully replaced it with Russian in all spheres of public life is not in a position to tell us now what language we should speak and write. Let us compare. There are Ukrainian schools in Australia, Argentina, Slovakia and many other countries. Russia, where about 3 million Ukrainians live — that is according only to the official count, but unofficially many more live there — does not have a single Ukrainian school. Moreover, there were seven Ukrainian and 15 Crimean Tatar schools in Crimea before the Russian occupation in 2014. The occupying authorities closed all Ukrainian schools and half of the Crimean Tatar schools. I can only repeat the words from the Sermon on the Mount:“Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.” (The Holy Bible, Matthew, 7:5)As far as our language law is concerned, let me say once again that is our own issue subject to our own work, and we will sort it out ourselves with the help of our partners, including the High Commissioner on National Minorities, the Venice Commission and other relevant international institutions.Every time the Russian delegation raises this subject, it pursues a double goal — to put political pressure on Ukraine and to distract attention from other issues. In May, it tried to impose its own agenda on the newly elected President of Ukraine, who was inaugurated the very same day, and to distract attention from the anniversary of the deportation of Crimean Tatars by the Stalin regime.Today, by raising this spurious issue four days before the parliamentary elections in Ukraine, Moscow is trying to provide political support to the pro-Russian parties. At the same time, Moscow is trying to divert attention from the anniversary of the downing by the Russian military of flight MH-17 on 17 July 2014 and from the implementation of the Minsk agreements, or, to be more precise, their persistent non-implementation by Russia. That is why my delegation requested that the Security Council consider developments related to the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian conflict, and we are thankful for today’s discussion.This is the first Council meeting on the Russian-Ukrainian conflict after the presidential elections in Ukraine. I therefore would like to reiterate the unwavering commitment of Ukraine’s new leadership to the politico-diplomatic way of resolving the conflict. The implementation of the Minsk agreements remains among its top priorities.Right after assuming his duties as Head of State, President Zelenskyi took concrete steps towards ensuring the potency of the Trilateral Contact Group, the revitalization of the Normandy format and achieving the disengagement of forces in Donbas. Thus, the Ukrainian side has demonstrated in deed its constructive approach in search of the conflict’s resolution. What have we received in return?Despite the agreement reached by the Trilateral Contact Group on the ceasefire starting on 8 March, the Russian occupation forces in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions have violated it almost 2,000 times. Heavy weapons, prohibited by the Minsk agreements, including tanks, heavy artillery and mortars, have been used almost 800 times. Those provocations have resulted in the death of 36 Ukrainian servicemen. Approximately 200 servicemen have been wounded. In June alone, Ukraine lost nine military personnel owing to unprovoked enemy fire.Since the new President took office, the Russian forces and their proxies have almost doubled their ceasefire violations. Is that what Russian peace proposals look like? The Russian forces intentionally target civilian infrastructure facilities throughout the area. Is that an invitation to the direct talks that the Russian Federation persistently calls for? Detailed information on all such violations has been regularly reported by the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for five years, but the Russian delegation prefers to talk here about the language law.The situation on the ground appears very bleak, as Russia shows no indication of readiness to abandon its aggressive goals in Ukraine. The implementation of the Minsk agreements by the Kremlin, first and foremost in the security sphere, remains stalled. The illegal “passportization” continues. The security situation in Donbas continues to deteriorate. The de-occupation of Crimea has not started. Ukrainian citizens continue to be used as hostages by Moscow in its hybrid war against my country. The Charter of the United Nations, the norms of international law and the binding orders of international courts and tribunals remain dead letter for the Russian Federation, which keeps denying that it is a party to the conflict that it masterminded, initiated and continues to fuel.Let us return to the Minsk agreements, namely, to the package of measures of 12 February 2015, on which Ambassador Nebenzia so enjoys lecturing the members of the Council.With regard to paragraph 1 on an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire (see resolution 2202 (2015), annex), recently, the Russian forces intensified the shelling of Ukrainian military positions and residential areas, using 122-millimetre and 152-millimetre heavy artillery. On 1 July, an ambulance, bearing every indication of medical transport, was targeted by the Russian occupation forces with an anti-tank rocket. As a result, two Ukrainian medics evacuating a wounded soldier near the village of Vodyane were killed, and one died later in the hospital. Did the militants not know that shelling a medical vehicle is a violation of the norms of international humanitarian law? Of course they knew, and the Russian delegation still wants to discuss the use of Ukrainian language in the public life of my country. For those who have forgotten, I will cite paragraph 1 of resolution 2286 (2016):“[The Security Council] strongly condemns acts of violence, attacks and threats against the wounded and sick, medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of transport and equipment”.The Russian delegation persistently asserts that Moscow has no obligations under the Minsk agreements and that it is only an impartial observer and mediator. Let us inject a dose of reality into those delirious claims. The 1st and 2nd Army Corps that constitute the main fighting force in the occupied territories of Donbas are part and parcel of Russia’s 8th Army, which has its headquarters in Novocherkask, in the Rostov region of Russia. All weapons, arms, ammunition, equipment and fuel are supplied to the occupied Donbas courtesy of the 8th Army. All command posts of any significance are occupied by Russian officers. Therefore, the responsibility for upholding any ceasefire agreement rests with the Russian military leadership and not some fictitious local militias. The Russian military presence and active participation in the war is an established fact, no matter how strenuously Russia may try to deny it.With regard to paragraph 2 of the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements, related to the withdrawal of all heavy weapons with the aim of creating a security zone, the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission continues to report weapons in violation of the respective withdrawal lines and outside of designated storage sites in the Russian-occupied territories of Donbas and a constant replenishment of fuel, lubricants and ammunition. Hundreds of pieces of Russian heavy weapons continue to pose a direct and serious military threat to Ukraine and its defenders. Much more remains hidden from the Mission’s eyes.With respect to paragraph 3 of the package of measures, related to the effective monitoring and verification by the OSCE of the ceasefire regime and the pull-out of heavy weapons, as reported by the Special Monitoring Mission, the Russian occupation authorities restrict the activities of the monitors, including by denying access of the Mission to border crossing points in the occupied parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Concerning paragraph 10 of the package of measures, related to the withdrawal of all foreign armed formations, military equipment and mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine under the monitoring of the OSCE, reports from Donbas confirm that there has been no withdrawal whatsoever. Instead, we see a systematic and incessant flow of Russian-made weapons, including the newest types, and ammunition through the uncontrolled segment of the Ukrainian-Russian State border.Which of the security provisions of the Minsk agreements can be considered to have been implemented by Russia? None. Not a single one. Despite the progress made on disengagement in Stanytsia Luhanska, the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission still observes a Russian military presence in areas where there should be none. The OSCE Mission has reported men in military-style clothing, who were illegally wearing blue armbands with “Joint Centre for Control and Coordination” (JCCC) written on them. We consider such actions by the Russian side to be yet another provocation, since, as of the end of 2017, only the Ukrainian part of the JCCC has continued to discharge its duties on site. As has already been mentioned in the Council at previous meetings, the Russian Federation has unilaterally and groundlessly withdrawn its officers from the bilateral structure. No one is authorized to replace them.Despite ample proof of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine in Donbas, it remains in denial. That is Moscow’s usual tactic — to deny the obvious, despite any evidence. It is the same way it denied the presence of its troops in Crimea and its role in seizing the peninsula. It is the same way it denied its role in the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH-17, which killed almost 300 passengers. Tomorrow will mark five years since that tragedy. I would again like to convey Ukraine’s deepest condolences to the families of all of the victims and reassure them that the perpetrators must and will be held to account, in compliance with resolution 2166 (2014).Ukraine fully supports the efforts by the Joint Investigation Team, which includes investigators and prosecutors from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. The start of criminal prosecution is an important milestone in uncovering the full truth and ensuring that justice will be done. We welcome the decision of the Netherlands and Australia to hold the Russian Federation responsible under international law for its role in the downing of flight MH-17.Let me also remind the Council of an event that took place on 25 November last year, when Russia attacked and captured the Ukrainian navy ships Berdyansk and Nikopol and the tugboat Yana Kapu, as well as 24 Ukrainian servicemen. That was nothing more than another act of aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. It was a blatant violation of the core principle of customary international law and international law of the sea — the immunity of warships. Russian overtly neglects warship immunity and creates a dangerous precedent that irreparably harms the whole system of the freedom of navigation on the high seas.Russia has continued to deny that international wrongful act, but today it has gone even further. It denies the jurisdiction of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) and ignores its binding orders. On 25 May, ITLOS ruled in the Case concerning the detention of three Ukrainian naval vessels (Ukraine v. Russian Federation) by 19 votes to 1 that Russia should immediately release the three vessels and ensure their return to the custody of Ukraine, and release its 24 servicemen and allow them to return to Ukraine. Russia has not implemented it.We do not know the condition of those military vessels. We do know the situation with the 24 servicemen of those vessels. They are in a Russian prison — the infamous Lefortovo. They are very rarely allowed to be visited by the Ukrainian Consul and have not seen their families for more than seven months. Tomorrow, a Russian court will consider the continuation of the detention of the 24 Ukrainian servicemen. We call on the Russian Federation to comply, at last, with the binding orders of ITLOS, release the Ukrainian sailors and let them return to Ukraine.Russia’s general disregard for international law is obvious as the Russian occupation administration intensifies its repression of residents of Crimea under the pretext of fighting terrorism. That is how Russia reacts to hearings, which now take place at the International Court of Justice, on the application of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and the Arbitral Tribunal in the matter of the Dispute Concerning Coastal State Rights in the Black Sea, Sea of Azov, and the Kerch Strait (Ukraine v. the Russian Federation).The Russian occupation authorities continue to deny proper medical assistance to Ukrainian citizens in detention. They ignore the decision of the European Court of Human Rights of 11 June and refuse to transfer disabled Crimean Tatar Edem Bekirov to a hospital. Russia must immediately and unconditionally release all Ukrainian citizens illegally held by the Kremlin, including in the Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine. Until then, they must be given all necessary medical assistance and legal protection.Russia’s blatant disrespect of international jurisdictional bodies should receive an appropriate response. We call for the strengthening of political and economic sanctions on the aggressor State until Russia stops violating human rights in the temporarily occupied Crimea, releases all illegally detained citizens of Ukraine and de-occupies the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol.I do not have a recipe for a political settlement to the conflict. Various ideas and initiatives have been introduced to provide additional impetus. None of them has worked so far. People are still being killed, ceasefires do not hold and the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate. The best the Council can do today is to express concern or call on the parties to do something. That is very unfortunate, particularly as the parties are present in the Chamber, even though one of them pretends it is not a party.Let us be practical. I would like to suggest very specific, simple and doable measures that Russia can implement, if Moscow really wishes to contribute to the resolution of the conflict and make the lives of civilians in the conflict zone at least a little bit easier.First, it must ensure that the so-called harvest ceasefire, which was agreed by the Normandy Four, is sustained and withdraw heavy weaponry. Secondly, it should unblock the process of prisoner exchange, including in relation to the Ukrainian citizens detained by the Russian occupation authorities; provide access to them, including by the International Committee of the Red Cross; and allow searches for missing persons. Thirdly, it must unconditionally release the 24 Ukrainian servicemen, as ordered by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. Fourthly, it must withdraw its military from the disengagement area and dismantle its fortification structures there. Fifthly, it should agree on the opening of additional crossing checkpoints.Of course, this is a very short list and I could go on and on naming relevant measures. But we must start somewhere. Let us make a difference. As the famous Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu said, centuries ago: “A journey of thousand miles begins with a single step.”To show respect to my Russian colleague, Mr. Vassily Nebenzia, I have chosen to speak in Russian, especially since it would seem to be appropriate in the light of his fabricated topic for today’s meeting. I will be very brief. The second statement delivered by Mr. Nebenzia bore out my gravest concerns, namely, that once again he has confused a Security Council meeting with a talk show — a very popular talk show in the Russian Federation called 60 Minutes, with Olga Skabeeva. But today’s meeting is not a talk show.",,"We wish to express our gratitude for the invitation to this meeting, as well as to Ms. DiCarlo and Mr. Zannier for their important briefings.The Dominican Republic takes this opportunity to salute the new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi’s inauguration. We welcome the pronouncements to prioritize the resolution of the conflict in the eastern region of his country. We wish him many successes in his Administration.The Security Council and the international community received the Minsk agreements as an expression of the parties’ legitimate interest in achieving a sustainable and lasting peace. However, more than four years after the signing of the agreements, we continue to witness ongoing violations of the ceasefire, the worrisome need for humanitarian assistance for civilians in the conflict zone, the alarmingly high number of people — around 4 million — affected by hunger and misery and the painful reality that more than 1.5 million internally displaced persons are still unable to return to their homes. Added to that are the constant unilateral measures that, in fact, do not contribute to moving the peace process forward.We once again call on the parties to relax their positions and open the way to dialogue and to reaffirm their commitment to peace, multilateralism and the peaceful settlement of disputes. The Dominican Republic urges the parties to ensure the collective interest and respect for human rights, guarantees and freedoms for all its inhabitants — for both those of the majority and those of the minority, including the rights and prerogatives relating to the language of the latter populations.In the context of today’s meeting, it is essential to act on an impartial assessment of the situation of minorities. To that end, we reiterate that it is necessary to maintain a dialogue with all the relevant parties. It is also necessary to move forward without delay towards a sustainable solution. To achieve that, the parties are called upon to refrain from any unilateral action that might hinder the process of implementing the agreements and complicate the efforts being made to build peace in the Ukrainian people and their surroundings.In conclusion, the Dominican Republic reiterates its recognition of the unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. At the same time, we take this opportunity to highlight the continued efforts and customary support of the Organization and the international community to overcome the adversities suffered by the Ukrainian people in the midst of the conflict that has affected them for years. Accordingly, we call for the maintenance of conditions that allow for the continuation of the dialogue between the parties in the current Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group and insist on the full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to put an end to the conflicts and restore international peace and security in Ukraine and the region.",,"I wish first of all to thank Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo and High Commissioner Lamberto Zannier for their comprehensive briefings.I would also like to congratulate the people of Ukraine on the inauguration of President Volodymyr Zelenskyi on 20 May. We wish the President and the people of Ukraine every success in navigating all the challenges faced by Ukraine on the road to peace and prosperity.On many previous occasions, Indonesia has stated its position with regard to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as non-interference in its internal affairs. We have also reiterated the need for all parties to exercise restraint, manage the crisis responsibly and uphold international law. We are of the view that it is crucial for all parties concerned to fully implement resolution 2202 (2015). Allow me to highlight the following points.First, we fully respect Ukraine’s national competence over the internal matters of the country, including the establishment of the status of the Ukrainian language as the country’s national language, as stipulated in its law adopted on 15 May. As a country that comprises more than 300 ethnic groups, and with over 700 living languages spoken, Indonesia fully understands the unifying power of language, which is precisely the essence of language: to unite people instead of dividing them. That has always been our credo, and we hope that this spirit of inclusion, including respecting the rights of minorities, is always kept in mind to ensure a united society and lasting peace in Ukraine. We therefore take note and welcome the intention of President Zelenskyi to conduct a thorough analysis of the law to ensure that the constitutional rights and interests of Ukrainian citizens of all ethnicities, religions and backgrounds are fully respected.Secondly, we cannot overemphasize the importance of implementing internationally agreed commitments. It is the responsibility of all sides to make good on their commitments as set out in the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements contained in resolution 2202 (2015). The full implementation of those commitments is essential to the peaceful resolution of the conflict and to avoiding further escalation thereof. We therefore urge all parties to demonstrate the necessary political will to ensure the end of the conflict and bring about peace and stability in Ukraine. All parties must cease resorting to actions that can be construed as detrimental to the implementation of the agreed commitments.Thirdly, we commend and support the efforts of all parties, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Trilateral Contact Group, in facilitating and monitoring the implementation of the Minsk agreements. We urge all parties to support and ensure the implementation of the mandate of the OSCE and its effective engagement.Lastly, allow me to reiterate that a sustainable solution to the crisis can be attained only through a genuine dialogue among the parties, supported by the United Nations and the international community. We fully support all constructive efforts aimed at peacefully resolving the conflict in Ukraine, in accordance with international law and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.",,"At the outset, I would like to thank Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo and Mr. Lamberto Zannier for their insightful briefings.The population of Ukraine has just elected a new President, Mr. Volodymyr Zelenskyi, through a democratic electoral process. The outgoing President, Mr. Poroshenko, has ensured a constructive transition. Those are two important achievements in a complex political, economic and security environment. In addition, Mr. Zelenskyi, has expressed openness towards the entire Ukrainian population, including zones not controlled by the Government. In recent days, Mr. Zelenskyi has reached out to the Russian Government to hold consultations. Belgium encourages Russia to participate constructively with the new President, and we call on the Russian authorities to consider this political momentum in Ukraine as an opportunity not to be missed.The implementation of the Minsk agreements is the only way to achieve a lasting political solution to the conflict. Ukraine should, for example, take fully heed the Venice Commission’s recommendations on the law on education, in accordance with its commitment, and the law on the use of languages should be in line with the obligations of the Minsk agreements. We therefore expect all parties to refrain from taking unilateral measures that could exacerbate tensions, to implement those agreements promptly and fully and to honour their commitments.All actors must respect the ceasefire and uphold international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians and civilian structures. They have a responsibility to improve humanitarian access by ensuring the safety of humanitarian workers and removing bureaucratic obstacles. The parties must guarantee the freedom of movement of OSCE observers throughout Ukraine, including along the Ukrainian-Russian border and in Crimea. We are particularly concerned that the technical instruments of the OSCE Mission are being targeted and blocked on an ongoing basis.I take this opportunity to reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. We reiterate our support for the efforts of the Trilateral Contact Group, the ОSСЕ and the Normandy format. We hope that the new President will continue on the path of the political and economic reforms that the country needs, particularly in the context of the implementation of the European Union Association Agreement. Belgium will continue to offer its support to that process, as well as to the Ukrainian people.We reiterate our deepest concern over the escalation in the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov, as well as over Russia’s violations of international law. In that regard, we regret that Russia has yet to comply with the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea’s order, dating back to May 25. We call on Russia to uphold that legally binding decision and to release without delay the 24 military personnel captured in November 2018, as well as the three vessels.We condemn any obstruction of navigation and free passage in the Kerch Strait. The militarization of Crimea and any illegal use of force could further destabilize the region and escalate tensions. We urge Russia to ensure free passage through the Sea of Azov without hindrance, in accordance with international maritime law.As other colleagues have recalled, tomorrow will mark five years since Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 was shot down over the southern part of Ukraine. That tragic event claimed the lives of 298 people, including several Belgians. The Joint Investigation Team, of which Belgium is a member, recently made public the names of four suspects allegedly involved. Their identification does not end the investigation, and Belgium continues to call on all countries to lend their cooperation, in accordance with resolution 2166 (2014), so that all those responsible can be prosecuted and justice can be rendered in an independent, honest and transparent manner to the victims and their families.",,"At the outset, we wish to thank Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo and High Commissioner Zannier for their briefings today.With regard to the matter brought to the attention of this meeting, South Africa continues to encourage all the parties to strengthen all diplomatic efforts so as to avoid an escalation of tensions and work towards an inclusive, sustainable and peaceful solution based on cooperation and genuine dialogue. It is also of critical importance that all the parties refrain from actions that could be viewed as provocative, which may further impede a peaceful resolution of the situation.Non-implementation of existing agreements leads to unintended consequences. We wish to reiterate the necessity for all the parties to fully implement all their respective commitments under the Minsk agreements, which provide the most promising road map for the peaceful settlement of the current hostilities, including in eastern Ukraine, and to advance the cause of peace and stability in the wider region.In conclusion, we encourage all parties to approach dialogue in the spirit of compromise in order to move the process forward.",,,"I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Peru.We thank this morning’s briefers — Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo and Mr. Lamberto Zannier — for their briefings. I will begin by welcoming the recent decision of the Russian and Ukrainian Presidents to resume talks under the Normandy format and to continue working at the expert level, including with a view to a prisoner exchange in the near future.In line with the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes, Peru recognizes and supports the efforts of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group to facilitate a political solution to the situation in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In that regard, we believe that both countries should capitalize on those opportunities and mechanisms to promote dialogue, while refraining from actions that exacerbate tensions and hinder the possibilities for dialogue between the parties.In that regard, we took note of the entry into force of the law to strengthen the use of the Ukrainian language, and we express our concern that the rights of linguistic minorities in the country, such as those in Donbas, may be affected. Similarly, we also express our concern about the Russian executive order to expeditiously grant Russian nationality to residents of those regions, given that they are controlled by separatist groups.Therefore, in line with the decision of the Presidents of both countries, we call on all parties and actors involved to work together with a view to promoting trust and dialogue and to step up the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, starting with the ceasefire commitment.For Peru, the Minsk agreements remain the legal basis for and the political solution to the situation in eastern Ukraine, and we support the package of measures and its full implementation endorsed by the Council more than four years ago. In that regard, we take this opportunity to welcome the decision by both parties to withdraw their troops and artillery from the Stanytsia Luhanska area, which also helps address the serious humanitarian situation. We acknowledge the important work and efforts of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in carrying out that task.In conclusion, I reiterate our commitment to the independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine within internationally recognized borders, in line with the Charter of the United Nations and the Minsk agreements. I now I now resume my functions as President of the Council.I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine. ","Мy delegation commends Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, and Mr. Lamberto Zannier, High Commissioner on National Minorities of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, for their informative briefings on the entry into force on 15 July 2019 of the law establishing Ukrainian as the sole national language.Whenever the Security Council has been seized of worrying developments in the situation in Ukraine and the region, Côte d’Ivoire has remained consistent in its call on all stakeholders in the crisis to exercise the utmost restraint and prioritize dialogue as a means of resolving their dispute. My country remains convinced that the lack of progress in the implementation of the Minsk agreements and the unilateral initiatives that exacerbate tensions reduce the prospects for a peaceful solution to the current crisis in Ukraine. In that especially volatile context, fuelled by a climate of mutual mistrust, Côte d’Ivoire reaffirms its conviction that lasting peace and stability will be possible only with ongoing dialogue that enables compromise among all parties.In that respect, it welcomes the telephone interview on 11 July, which allowed Presidents Volodymyr Zelenskyi and Vladimir Putin to discuss a number of topics, including the situation in south-eastern Ukraine. Côte d’Ivoire would like to express its hope that the telephone exchange will pave the way for many more consultations between the two Presidents with a view to restoring the much-needed dialogue in the Normandy format, including its possible expansion.In conclusion, Côte d’Ivoire remains convinced that, despite the complexity of the current crisis, the restoration of peace and peaceful coexistence is possible in Ukraine. It is up to the political actors to work, through dialogue, towards achieving that noble aspiration in order to protect the entire region from a confrontation with disastrous humanitarian consequences.","We join other members in expressing our thanks to Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo and Mr. Lamberto Zannier for the detailed briefings they have just delivered and of which we have taken careful note.My delegation pays close attention to the situation in Ukraine, especially the complex crisis in the eastern part of the country. We believe that the crisis must be resolved politically in order to achieve the stabilization of the country and to strengthen and improve relations with the countries of the region. Given the complexity and fragility of the security, stability and development situation, which has yet to be resolved, we believe that the parties involved must show greater resolve and willingness to improve the situation in the east of the country.In that context, my delegation calls on the parties to exercise restraint in order to prevent certain actions and decisions from causing an escalation of the situation between them, leading to long-term consequences. We also encourage them to refrain from future actions that could aggravate and destabilize the situation, thereby undermining the efforts of the international community, including those of the Security Council, to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis. That is why we call for their cooperation to reduce tensions.As it has reiterated on other occasions, the Government of Equatorial Guinea believes that the implementation of the Minsk agreements in their entirety remains essential to the restoration of peace and the achievement of stability in the region. We therefore regret the daily violations of the ceasefire, in direct breach of the Minsk agreements, and urge the parties to work towards a solution to the crisis in the eastern part of the country, taking into account the package of measures contained in that agreement.We recall that the Minsk agreements, signed in February 2015 and ratified in resolution 2202 (2015), remain the foundation of the international community’s commitment to the peaceful settlement of the conflict in Ukraine. We therefore encourage the parties to respect the full implementation of the agreements and to focus their efforts on facilitating an inclusive dialogue, in which the interests of all citizens prevail, that helps to strengthen harmonious relations among the various ethnic groups of Ukraine.In conclusion, we once again commend the work of humanitarian actors in delivering humanitarian aid in the region in order to provide vital assistance. We also express our support for and welcome the efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission, in particular to facilitate dialogue, as well as to maintain stability in the region. We encourage the parties to prioritize dialogue and to show greater political will in order to help to reduce tensions and find a lasting solution to the crisis.","First, let me thank Ms. DiCarlo and Mr. Zannier for their briefings.The State of Kuwait believes that all States have the right to adopt an official State language through their Constitutions. That is one of the most important elements supporting the existence and identity of the State. In that regard, the use of languages in Ukraine is provided for by its Constitution and regulated by law. Furthermore, article 10 of the Constitution provides that the official language of the State of Ukraine is Ukrainian. The State guarantees the development and use of the Ukrainian language in all aspects of social life throughout Ukrainian territory. despite the fact 16 July 2019.Since the law provides for a transitional period of six months to 10 years for the implementation of some of its provisions. Both the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the High Commissioner on National Minorities of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have provided advice to the Ukrainian authorities on language issues to ensure a balanced legislation that unite the diverse Ukrainian society. We hope that the relevant parties will implement those provisions and recommendation, which are likely to ease tensions.On another level, we call on the two sides to show restraint and undertake all the measures necessary to de-escalate the situation, diffuse military tension in the Sea of Azov and commit to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We also urge them to demonstrate the necessary political will to re-commit to the full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to end the conflict and preserve peace and security in the region. We renew the call for dialogue as the best peaceful means to resolve disputes and conflicts no matter how diverse they might be, based on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Therefore, we also renew our appeal to the parties to engage seriously and in good faith in that dialogue to maintain the security and stability of the region and pursue a comprehensive and balanced solution to the issue through dialogue, as provided for in Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations. In that regard, we call for enhanced dialogue between both parties and at all levels to lend greater momentum to the settlement of the dispute.Moreover, we observe with concern the ongoing unstable situation in eastern Ukraine, now in its fifth year. The situation has had grave humanitarian and economic consequences for the daily lives of the people and for the infrastructure. More than 3.5 million out of a total of 5.2 million people need urgent humanitarian assistance, in addition to the 1.5 million internally displaced persons. We therefore urge both parties not to take any escalatory measures or steps that would fuel the conflict or obstruct the progress made in the implementation of Minsk agreements, which represent the only agreed framework for a settlement of the dispute within its regional scope.In conclusion, we renew our commitment to the unity and sovereignty of Ukraine, as well as its territorial integrity inside its internationally recognized borders. We call for non-intervention in its internal affairs and express the hope that all the relevant parties will work to implement resolution 2202 (2015) and the Minsk peace agreements, including a full commitment to its package of measures.","Let me thank Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo and Mr. Lamberto Zannier for their contributions to today’s briefing.We strongly believe that the Russian aggression against Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is a direct threat to international peace and security. At the same time, the Ukrainian legitimate authorities’ adoption of a law is not. We would like to use this opportunity to underline a few facts about the current crisis in and around Ukraine, which has been provoked and deliberately fuelled by the Russian Federation since 2014.The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission regularly reports about ceasefire violations, explosions and incidents. The Monitoring Mission’s observers are recording hundreds of ceasefire violations each day, including the deployment of weapons prohibited under the Minsk agreements. The overwhelming majority of ceasefire violations, illegal deployments and movement restrictions are committed by Russia-backed and -controlled illegal military formations in the areas of Donbas that are not controlled by the Ukrainian Government. We regret that the Russia-controlled armed formations continue to undermine the efficiency of the Special Monitoring Mission by restricting its freedom of movement, intimidating monitors and attacking the Mission’s assets.No one should ever doubt that Russia’s attack against Ukraine in 2014 and its illegal annexation of Crimea was an act of aggression and a flagrant violation of the prohibition on the use of force. It was Russia that used a sham referendum to take over a part of a sovereign country, not Ukraine. Russian ships attacked vessels and captured their crew in the Kerch Strait. Again, that was not Ukraine. In that regard, Ukraine has the right to promote its national language.The list goes on and on: illegal elections in non-Government controlled areas of Ukraine in 2018, the introduction of the ruble zone and the official recognition of documents used by the illegal military bodies of certain parts of Donbas. How can one still try to equate the actions of both sides and call on both parties to show restraint and goodwill?In May, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ruled that Russia must immediately release vessels captured in the Kerch Strait and free the 24 servicemen. It has been nearly two months since the ruling and Russia continues to ignore the legally binding decision, offering instead to have the servicemen transferred and tried on Ukrainian soil according to Russian law, which is obviously unacceptable.Despite Russia’s failure to implement its security commitments, the Ukrainian Government has met a number of its political commitments — the President has signed a law on special status for Donbas, the Verkhovna Rada has passed an amnesty law and Ukraine has repeatedly called for an exchange of detainees. Lately, the Ukrainian side demonstrated its commitment to a constructive approach to achieve the conflict’s resolution by initiating a withdrawal of its forces near Stanytsia Luhanska.The response remains grim. Despite the progress achieved on disengagement in Stanytsia Luhanska, the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission still observes a Russian military presence in areas where there should be none. Moreover, the Russian Federation did not support the so-called harvest ceasefire suggested by Ukraine at the Trilateral Contact Group meeting. Further political steps — including local elections in Donbas, held under Ukrainian law — are impossible while parts of eastern Ukraine remain under Russia’s control.Russia continues its policy of flagrant disregard for the fundamental principles of international law with respect to Ukraine. Russia’s actions continue to undermine the peace process, particularly the Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015, which define the modalities for a permanent ceasefire and provide for Ukraine’s reintegration of temporarily occupied territories.During the previous Council meeting on this crisis in April (see S/PV.8516), Poland condemned Russia’s decision to provide expedited Russian citizenship to Ukrainian citizens living in the Russian-controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine. It was the first and — most certainly — will not be the last challenge the Russian authorities pose to the new President of Ukraine. It is disappointing to see that Russia is not able to respond positively and constructively. Moscow can only continue its tactics of throwing logs to trip up other people.Russia’s continued fuelling of tensions in Donbas remains a direct challenge to international security, with grave implications for the international legal order that protects the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all States. The international community should neither accept nor recognize such a cascade of disregard for the fundamental principles of international law and should respond accordingly to Russia’s unacceptable and illegal behaviour.Last, but not least, I would like to draw the Council’s attention to the upcoming fifth anniversary of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, which claimed the lives of 298 victims from 17 countries. We pay tribute to those who lost their lives and reassure the families of the victims that we will support the efforts of investigators to establish truth, justice and accountability for the downing of Flight MH-17. We call on all States, including the Russian Federation, to fully cooperate with efforts to establish accountability for the downing of Flight MH-17, in line with resolution 2166 (2014).In conclusion, I once again underline Poland’s unwavering support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S/PV.8270,29/05/2018,Deterioration of the situation at the contact line including in the area around the Donetsk filtration station in 2017.,"At the outset, I express my appreciation to you, Sir, for presiding over this open meeting. I wish to thank Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo, Assistant Secretary- General Mueller and Ambassador Apakan, of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, for their briefings. China has been closely following the developments in eastern Ukraine. We are concerned about recent conflicts in the area causing civilian casualties. We have noted that the Minsk Tripartite Contact Group held consultations on the implementation of the Minsk agreements to promote a peaceful settlement of the Ukrainian issue. While the international community continues to step up its mediation efforts, we call on both parties to the conflict to strictly abide by the ceasefire mechanism and stay the course to a political settlement. In seeking a fundamental and long-term solution to the Ukrainian issue, it is necessary to take care of the legitimate rights and interests of all the regions and ethnic groups, as well as to address the legitimate concerns of all the relevant parties to balance their different interests. China believes that the Ukrainian issue involves a complicated historical genesis and reality and that the conflict needs to be addressed at its roots. China has consistently maintained that all the parties concerned must fully implement resolution 2202 (2015). They must effectively cease all hostilities, fully implement the Minsk agreements and stay committed to seeking a comprehensive, lasting, balanced solution to the Ukrainian issue. That must be done through dialogue and consultation in order to take forward peace, stability and development in Ukraine and promote harmony among all ethnic groups in Ukraine, as well as to facilitate peaceful coexistence between Ukraine and the countries of the region. The international community should continue to support the diplomatic efforts of all the relevant parties for the political settlement of the Ukrainian issue. Council discussions should be conducive to a genuine relaxation in the situation of the relevant regions in Ukraine and help move towards a proper solution to the Ukrainian issue. ","I thank the Polish presidency of the Security Council through you, Mr. Minister, for convening today’s important public meeting of the Security Council on the situation in Ukraine. Let me also welcome the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands and Ukraine. I would like to thank the Assistant Secretary- General for Political Affairs, Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo; the Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, Ms. Ursula Mueller; and the Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, Ambassador Ertuğrul Apakan, for their very insightful briefings. Given that French and German authorities are committed to resolving the crisis, I am honoured to deliver this statement on behalf of France and Germany. This joint statement, which is quite extraordinary, demonstrates the strong commitment of both countries within the framework of the Normandy format. As we mark the one hundredth anniversary of the end of the First World War this year, eastern Ukraine has been ravaged for more than four years by a conflict of an intensity rarely seen in Europe. More than 70 years after the Second World War, in a conflict in which both Ukraine and Russia paid an extraordinarily high price, more than 10,000 civilians and military personnel have lost their lives, millions of people have been displaced and millions more have been affected by clashes in the Donbas region. For four years Germany and France have spared no effort to ease the suffering of those concerned and to put an end to the conflict. Following the Minsk protocol, the Minsk agreements were drafted in 2015 under the Normandy format and specify steps to end the crisis. Three years after the adoption of resolution 2202 (2015), which endorses the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements, now more than ever before, we call upon all parties to honour their commitments. We also recall our full support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. Against that backdrop, we would like to underscore three points. The first point pertains to the security situation, which is a precondition for improving the plight of the civilian population. By no means a frozen conflict, although the parties have promised to silence their weapons on several occasions, including as recently as 30 March, eastern Ukraine is the site of daily clashes. Hundreds of ceasefire violations are observed every day by the OSCE. We pay tribute to that organization for its excellent work and for the risks its team faces. We implore the parties, in particular Russia, to do their utmost to facilitate the freedom of movement of observers and to ensure their safety and that of their equipment, including drones. France and Germany condemn all ceasefire violations in the strongest terms. We once again call for the withdrawal of heavy weaponry, which is again being employed for attacks against civilian infrastructure. It is unacceptable that schools continue to be the targets of shelling. Both parties must also make headway on the disengagement of forces along the contact line in areas already identified as present or future disengagement areas. Those first steps will create a climate of trust and prevent the occurrence of another tragic event similar to the one that occurred on 17 July 2014 when the 298 passengers and flight crew of Malaysia Flight Airlines MH-17 tragically lost their lives after the plane was shot down by a missile. We commend the professionalism of the Joint Investigation Team, whose work is fully independent. In order to shed light on the tragedy and bring those responsible to justice, it is crucial that investigators have the full cooperation of all Member States. Our second point refers to the urgent humanitarian situation. In April alone, we recorded 23 fatalities, including five civilians, and 115 injuries. May’s death toll already exceeds April’s. During the harsh winter months, hundreds of thousands of people went without water, electricity and heat for more than a day. They also faced worsening food insecurity and deteriorating health, in particular women and children. In order to ease the suffering of the civilian population, Germany and France request that humanitarian workers be granted access to the Donbas region and that their safety be guaranteed. We implore all parties to protect key civilian infrastructure, such as the Donetsk filtration station, and to open additional checkpoints along the contact line. We encourage another exchange of prisoners, which would convey trust, which all of us want. Lastly, a long-term solution to the crisis also depends on the political and economic measures that will be taken. Considerable progress has been made by Ukrainian authorities over the past three years in the implementation of the political commitments made under the Minsk agreements. Legislative arrangements must still be finalized to enable the holding of local elections in certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk and the development of a plan to ensure they are held in the best possible conditions. It is expected that specific measures will be taken to improve the lives of people in the Donbas region — for example, by guaranteeing the right to a pension or by dispatching a team of experts on environmental issues. France and Germany will continue to stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people, who have been battered in recent years by the conflict in Donbas and the illegal annexation of Crimea. Our efforts within the framework of the Normandy format are an expression of our desire to succeed in alleviating the suffering of the Ukrainian people and to lay the foundation for lasting peace throughout the European continent. ","I have listened attentively to my colleagues, and now I would like to ask them to listen to me and be patient. It has been some time since we discussed Ukraine and I am therefore doubly grateful to the Polish presidency for taking this initiative. I would also like to thank Ms. DiCarlo, Ms. Mueller and Mr. Apakan for their briefings. Immediately after my statement we will hear the following: in February 2014, a revolution of honour took place in Ukraine. Let me point out, parenthetically, that one synonym for “revolution” is “coup d’état”. Does that mean that in Kyiv they do in fact admit that what happened in Ukraine was a coup and a power grab? The statement will go on to say that Russia could not be reconciled to this and launched a war on Ukraine. Its troops are in Donbas. It has occupied Crimea. For all intents and purposes Russia is waging a third world war using hybrid methods. This is a battle of civilizations. A world of serfdom has challenged a world of freedom. Ukraine is on the front lines of this struggle between Muscovite barbarity and the civilized world. I could go on listing these pathetic propositions, but I will leave Mr. Klimkin the opportunity to expand on them. The problem is that we are dealing with sellers of air. But to give it its due, the Kyiv propaganda machine has succeeded in painting a picture of an unfortunate, freedom-loving, peace-loving Ukraine, desperately fighting a perfidious, hating and hated Mordor. However, it has not done it on its own. It has been helped by its patrons in the West — who are all sitting here in this Chamber to my left and right. It is true, however, that they have recently begun to realize that there is something wrong with this picture, which is a painfully surreal one. Ukraine has declared that it is in a state of war with Russia, although who in the circumstances is the aggressor is not clear, considering that we are at war with no one. And yet no war footing has been declared, our embassies are functioning, a no-visa regime is in effect and millions of citizens of both countries mingle across our borders. They visit relatives, take trips to Russia for work, vacation in so- called occupied Crimea, conduct trade, do business and do not in any way experience hostility either from the so-called aggressor or the people who are its so- called victims. The so-called revolution of honour — or rather coup — came about in order to overthrow the hated and corrupt Yanukovych regime. So where are we now? Are Ukrainians better off today? Kyiv’s Western patrons are well aware of the horrifying level of corruption in Ukraine and the country’s dire economic condition. But there is a panacea for that. Just blame Russia for all of Ukraine’s ills, which is what is happening and usually in caricatured form. To take one example, before the UEFA Champions League final in Kyiv, a group of Ukrainian fans beat up some English supporters. Regrettably, that happens. There followed an explanation distinguished by its simplicity. It was a provocation by the Russian Federal Security Service, and the fans were Russians. Whatever happens in Ukraine, the universal theory is that it all leads to Russia. My dear friends here are in deep, self-imposed isolation where information about what is going on in Ukraine is concerned. They consume the shibboleths and clichés dished up by the Western media and the doctrines of their Ukrainian clients. Have many of them done in-depth analyses of the social and political situation and the moral and psychological climate in Ukraine? Do they know the buckets of swill and loathing the Kyiv authorities shower on Russia, the lies they permit themselves and the malice they spew? But it is not just them. Does anyone here have an idea of the nonsense and fables that some Ukrainian media outlets disseminate about the situation in Crimea, the construction of the Crimean Bridge, the situation in Donbas, about Russia’s motives and so-called intentions? No, they have no idea. But we certainly do. Those media outlets that are willing to make up their own minds and hold undesirable world views, even if they are not pro-Russian or hostile, but simply in opposition, are steamrollered and shut down. On what pretext? Right. Because they are agents of the Kremlin. Independent and opposition journalists are killed and the crimes go uninvestigated. Literally just today the journalist and Russian citizen Arkady Babchenko was killed in Kyiv. It happened only a few hours ago. We can assume that the Ukrainian authorities will blame Russia for it, as they have done before more than once. Other journalists are fleeing the country to avoid persecution, and if they do not, they are arrested, like Kirill Vyshinsky, a Ukrainian citizen and head of RIA Novosti Ukraine. What was he accused of? High treason. The level of schizophrenia in Ukraine is off the charts. Let me point out that schizophrenia is not an insult. It is a psychiatric condition in which the personality is split in two. Thanks to the efforts of its current leaders, Ukraine is living in two parallel universes, its fictional state of so-called hybrid war with Russia and the real world, where there is no Russian invasion. And it is essential to be able to strictly control the information space in order to ensure that reality cannot contradict or cross paths with the virtual world that the Ukrainian authorities have created. This schizophrenia now extends to their ideology. The authorities in Kyiv are creating a pantheon of new Ukrainian heroes, warriors for its independence. For lack of any others, they have exalted Stepan Bandera and Roman Shukhevych, leaders of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), which cooperated with the Nazis. No matter that as far as half the population of Ukraine is concerned they are not heroes but criminals and collaborators. The important thing is to have heroes who are anti-Russian. Our Polish presidency of the Council knows perfectly well what sort of people Bandera and Shukhevych were. Poles have their own scores to settle with these men. And they know the kind of organization OUN is — one that annihilated Jews, Poles and Russians during the war. Except that today they did not say anything about that. It is strictly for Poland’s internal consumption. Talking about that kind of thing in this Chamber is simply inappropriate. A state of lawlessness exists right now in Ukraine that would not be tolerated in any law-abiding State. But there it can be. And one can close one’s eyes to it. The authorities in Kyiv are conducting an assault on basic human rights and freedoms, suppressing dissidents, using police-State methods, indulging the rise of extremist and neo-Nazist attitudes and working for the forced Ukrainization of the country. In September 2017 a law on education came into effect aimed at eradicating the entire Russian-language education system, in contravention of Ukraine’s obligations under the Minsk agreements. The law granting the right to use Russian at the regional level was repealed, ignoring the Venice Commission’s recommendations on making adjustments to ensure the rights of national minorities. Kyiv’s measures constitute linguistic cleansing, although it is a real stretch to call Russian a minority language in Ukraine. All of this goes against Ukraine’s own Constitution and its international legal obligations, both universal and regional. I would like to point out that the language issue has been one of the most basic motives of events in Ukraine. But Kyiv is not about to learn from its mistakes. The uncontrolled growth of nationalist and chauvinist sentiment in Ukraine is very worrying. Bandera’s birthday is being observed with torchlight parades on a virtually State-wide scale. The victims of the nationalists’ attacks include representatives of the media, television station offices and their owners’ homes. On 9 May radicals attempted to burn down the INTER TV offices for broadcasting a concert in honour of Victory Day. Nationalist attacks continue on Ukrainian Orthodox churches and journalists. Here at United Nations Headquarters, on 9 May, after a seminar conducted by the Ukrainian Mission, which it attempted to pass off as an official Committee on Information event, Ukrainian participants in the so- called anti-terrorist operation, including so-called snipers, tried to physically threaten a Russian diplomat. An official representative of the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs brought in the snipers, presented them as friends and later tried to depict the whole thing as Russian slander, lies and propaganda. To this day there has been no investigation of the tragedy that took place in Odessa on 2 May 2014, when radicals burned more than 50 people alive in the House of Trade Unions. But today the leader of OUN speaks of it with pride. That is just a taste of the examples I could give. The whole thing is really much sadder. That is why the residents of Crimea decided that they no longer wished to live under such conditions and left this Ukraine. The inhabitants of Donbas have been less lucky. A different scenario unrolled there. And yet they did not ask for much. They wanted to have autonomy within a united Ukraine, to speak their native language and honour their own heroes rather than those imposed on them by Kyiv. What is absurd about that? Why is it possible somewhere in Belgium, where Walloons and Flemings live peacefully together, but not in Ukraine? God forbid that Belgium should endure such a scenario. I wish it all the best and continued peace and joy. Has no one ever wondered why there have never been any protests in Donbas, large or small, against the local authorities, which Kyiv has labelled terrorists? And that is despite the fact that the people’s life there is not at all easy, thanks to the Kyiv authorities, who have shown their generous concern and hypocrisy vis-à-vis their own population by imposing a trade and economic blockade on them. For some reason we hear nothing about human rights violations in those areas or any demands for a speedy return to Kyiv’s control. Maybe the answer is simply that those people do not want to live in that kind of Ukraine either. The Council either does not know whom it is dealing with or is deliberately turning a blind eye, because, unfortunately, some of its members have no need whatever of a settlement of the conflict in Ukraine. All they want is a hotbed of instability on Russia’s borders and the satisfaction of schadenfreude at the tensions between two brother countries and peoples. But they are wrong if they imagine that this will last forever. Many speakers today have rightly talked about the fact that the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements, as affirmed in resolution 2202 (2015), represents the only possible foundation for a settlement. The phrase “Russia must fulfil the Minsk agreements” is now commonplace. But are many of those present in this Chamber familiar with the provisions of the Minsk agreements? Have they read them at all? Do they know by whom, how and in what sequence they should be implemented? If I may, I would like to remind them. There are 13 paragraphs in the package of measures. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 concern the comprehensive ceasefire and withdrawal of heavy weapons. Kyiv has not managed to achieve a durable ceasefire for three years and has ignored the truces declared by the Trilateral Contact Group. The Ukrainian forces’ equipment is regularly missing from its storage areas and is used for shelling civilian targets in Donbas. Incidentally, I would like to tell my British colleague that the workers from the Donetsk filtration station, like the filtration station itself, were shelled from the Ukrainian side, not the militias’. According to data from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, since the beginning of this year five civilians have been killed and 33 injured in militia-controlled areas, whereas there has been one civilian injury on Government-controlled territories. Kyiv has undermined and continues to sabotage the implementation of the framework agreement of 21 September 2016 on the disengagement of forces and hardware, despite the fact that the militias have regularly affirmed their willingness to abide by it. Ukrainian forces have regularly seized residential areas in the so-called grey zone, where such action is prohibited. The demining process has been obstructed and military preparations are fully under way. The Ukrainians are now conducting a military operation in Donbas with the so-called United Forces. Today, for some reason, exercises involving aviation support were conducted over Donbas. And a number of countries, instead of demanding that Kyiv fulfil its obligations, have begun supplying it with more arms. What kind of contribution to the implementation of the Minsk agreements is that? Paragraph 4 concerns the dialogue on the modalities of local elections. Kyiv has no intention of getting into any kind of dialogue, ignoring the signatures of the Donetsk and Luhansk representatives on the Minsk agreements. Listening to Ukrainian politicians, one would think there are no people there at all, only terrorists. And yet there are 4 million Ukrainian citizens living in Donbas. Paragraphs 5 and 6 concern pardons, amnesties and the release and exchange of all prisoners. In violation of the agreements, Kyiv has refused to enact through the Verkhovna Rada bills for amnesties for militias, although a similar procedure for participants in the Maidan riots in the winter of 2013 and 2014 was implemented. The militias have consistently declared their willingness to exchange prisoners on an all-for- all basis in accordance with the Minsk agreements, but Kyiv has persistently objected. Paragraph 7 concerns safe humanitarian access. The problems that have accumulated in that regard, as Ms. Mueller mentioned, must be resolved within the framework of the regular meetings of the Trilateral Contact Group in Minsk. The main problem is Kyiv’s unwillingness to hold a dialogue with the representatives of Donetsk and Luhansk. The result, essentially, is that today the residents of those regions can rely only on supplies from Russia, which is something else that we have been criticized for. Paragraph 8 concerns the restoration of socioeconomic ties. Kyiv has imposed a full economic, transport and food blockade of Donbas, which is evidently how the Kyiv authorities are trying to ensure that the ordinary residents of south-eastern Ukraine return to their fold. Paragraph 9 concerns the reinstatement of full control of the border. This is the point at which Kyiv and Washington start reading the package of measures. It states in black and white that this must take place “starting on day one after the local elections.... provided that paragraph 11 has been implemented”. That concerns “carrying out constitutional reform”, which has so far not happened. Only after that does paragraph 10 provide for the disarmament and withdrawal of illegal armed groups, by which Kyiv means militias and those mythical Russian troops, whose presence it asserts using various fakes. Let me once again disappoint some of those here today — there are no Russian troops in Donbas. Incidentally, the representative of the United States took a highly original approach today, lecturing us about Russia’s violations of international law through its invasion of other countries. Those were the words of the representative of the United States, a country with a long and renowned history of invasions of sovereign States, including in very recent times. The constitutional reform envisaged by paragraph 11 was supposed to be completed by the end of 2015. Its key elements call for decentralization and enacting legislation granting Donetsk and Luhansk special status. The Minsk provisions include residents’ right to linguistic self-determination, broad self-governance and support for cross-border cooperation with Russia. Not only has none of this been implemented, it has essentially been erased by the law on the so- called reintegration of Donbas, which came into effect on 24 February and does not even mention the Minsk agreements. Paragraph 12 concerns the holding of local elections in coordination with representatives of Luhansk and Donetsk. Needless to say, since Kyiv has rejected any dialogue, it is not being implemented either. Paragraph 13 concerns the establishment of working groups on the implementation of relevant aspects of the Minsk agreements. Who should comply with the Minsk agreements, in the Council’s opinion? Which of these paragraphs has to do with Moscow’s obligations? The Ukrainian leadership has stubbornly avoided meeting its obligations under the Minsk agreements on the political front. It has not ensured the adoption of permanent legislation on the special order for local self-government in Donbas and is sabotaging the implementation of the Steinmeier formula for its special status. The reason for Kyiv’s sabotage of the Minsk agreements is simple. It does not want a settlement. Nor does it need Donbas. Why would it want several million anti-Government citizens on the eve of the 2019 presidential elections? The bankrupt Kiev authorities’ ratings are at rock bottom. If they truly want a settlement, they have to negotiate with Donbas. That means that they will have to admit that this is an internal Ukrainian conflict and a fratricidal war. That is the naked truth. And that would be domestic and foreign policy suicide. Kiev does not possess the political will to implement the Minsk agreements and cannot afford to destroy the convenient paradigm it has created of Russian aggression and Russian-supported terrorists, which is so handy for hiding behind and getting support from the West. Because of that, we will continue to see Kyiv politicians enact their imitations of heated activity, theatrical performances and bombastic statements. In 2015, the Security Council attempted to provide Ukraine with genuine international assistance to Ukraine. Resolution 2202 (2015) enshrined the Minsk package of measures as the international legal basis for a settlement that today still remains the only effective mechanism for a political way out of the situation. No one should be under the illusion that any decision can be viable without taking the will of the population of Donbas into account. It was to support the agreements between Kyiv, Donetsk and Luhansk that we proposed considering the establishment of a peacekeeping operation. Unfortunately, instead of that we are seeing attempts to create some kind of alternative settlement format under United Nations auspices to replace the efforts of the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine and the Normandy format and turn the Minsk package of measures on its head. Nevertheless, the support that we have heard today for the Minsk agreements, which need only to be read correctly and implemented consistently, gives us hope that we will eventually succeed in achieving a settlement in this conflict-torn country, where those who suffer the most are ordinary Ukrainian citizens. Russia has a greater interest in seeing that succeed than anyone. That is why we would like to propose that the Council adopt a very short presidential statement. I will read it now, if I may. “The Security Council reaffirms unconditionally its resolution 2202 (2015), which endorses the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements, adopted and signed in Minsk on 12 February 2015. “The Security Council calls for ensuring the full, comprehensive and sequential implementation of the package of measures, including a comprehensive ceasefire, as provided for therein. “The Security Council calls strongly for refraining from any steps or rhetoric that contradict the letter and spirit of resolution 2202 (2015).” We hope that the Council will unanimously reaffirm its commitment to a peaceful settlement in Ukraine on the basis of the Minsk agreements. I cannot avoid discussing a very important and sensitive issue. Many speakers today have mentioned the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 over eastern Ukraine in July 2014. We were very saddened by the incident and, like everyone else, have been hoping for an independent and impartial investigation. We did not intend to bring up the subject today, since it has no direct relation to the political settlement in Ukraine. But as long as the Joint Investigation Team has rushed through the latest portion of its comments, evidently to be in time for today’s meeting, and some delegations in this Chamber, in their ignorance, have launched a new wave of anti-Russian sentiment, we have this to say. Our attitude to the tragedy of four years ago has not changed in any way. Naturally we are outraged by this dreadful incident, mourn the victims and sympathize with their loved ones. We insist on the conduct of a credible investigation. The true perpetrators of the tragedy must be determined on the basis of reliable evidence and brought to justice. I would like to remind the Council that immediately following the tragedy, Russia spearheaded the adoption of resolution 2166 (2014), which demanded an international investigation and defined very clear criteria for it. Since the disaster, we have regularly provided the Dutch with all possible assistance and have unfailingly called for ensuring the investigation’s transparency. The Office of Russia’s Prosecutor General has always responded promptly and fully to appeals for the provision of legal assistance. We have declassified and passed on to the investigation the design data for the BUK missile system, and have provided the results of experiments conducted for this type of missile by Almaz-Antey, its manufacturer. We also did what no one else has done. In October 2016, we passed on primary radar data, which is critically important to the investigation, since it cannot be forged. In particular, it completely excludes the possibility that the missile that hit the Boeing 777 came from militia-controlled territory, as the investigation insists. And yet the data was not even included in the results and I am asking why. How are we to understand the refusal of the Netherlands to give an assessment of the key circumstances of the tragedy, such as the fact that the Ukrainian authorities did not close the airspace over the zone of conflict to civil aviation or why nothing is said about Kyiv’s radar data or information from the Ukrainian air traffic controllers? I would like to remind the Council that so far the United States has not provided any satellite images, whose existence it announced immediately after the disaster. Instead of taking due account of the concrete, undeniable facts, the Joint Investigation Team is manipulating social network data whose authenticity cannot be verified. Moreover, even before the completion of the investigation, the Team launched a chain reaction of accusations about Russia in the spirit of Britain’s “highly likely” phrase. The European investigators have continued to discredit themselves by making accusations before the investigation is complete. All of this testifies to an unwillingness to seriously engage in the investigation and confirms the ideological and political motives behind the search for the perpetrators. Instead of that, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands informed us about the flat-out demand by the Netherlands and Australia that Russia to acknowledge its guilt. I will refrain from commenting on the letter’s content, and especially its tone, because I do not want to offend Holland’s Foreign Minister. But I would like to once again remind the Council, in case anyone has forgotten, that nobody is permitted to use ultimatums when speaking to Russia. We reaffirm our readiness to extend all possible assistance to a truly transparent and independent investigation. We cannot accept the groundless conclusions of the Joint Investigation Team. Considering the dirty tricks that some States are employing nowadays, we can trust only investigations in which Russia is a full participant. I will be very brief. As I said today, the Ukrainian Foreign Minister has already hinted at the version that it will put out about the murder of the unfortunate journalist Arkady Babchenko. I believe that Ukraine’s justice system, whose value we are familiar with, will no doubt discover a trail leading to Russia, as we promised the Council today. Secondly, I mentioned Crimea, or rather the Minister mentioned Crimea just now. I am touched by his concern for Crimea and the suffering of the people there. I have a piece of advice for him. He should not worry about them; they are quite happy. And today we are discussing Ukraine, not Crimea. Crimea is part of Russia. It is time to accept that fact and proceed accordingly. I want to say that I grieve for all who have died in this senseless conflict, including Darya Kazemirova, whose picture we just saw. I grieve for the soldiers of the Ukrainian army who have died as cannon fodder in this senseless conflict. And I grieve for all Ukrainians who have perished there, including those who have sadly died in Donbas, victims of Ukrainian weapons. There are many people who have suffered a fate similar to Darya Kazemirova’s, as the Minister well knows. He should not forget to bring their pictures for the next meeting. ","I join other colleagues in welcoming the three Ministers for Foreign Affairs to this important meeting. I should also like to thank the briefers from the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for their account and for the work they and their teams do on the ground. The United Kingdom joins others in welcoming this opportunity for the Security Council to receive an update on the situation in eastern Ukraine. As other speakers have done, we also stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people. The fighting in eastern Ukraine has continued unabated since 2014. The Under-Secretary-General set out some compelling facts about what is happening on the ground. But, for me, one of the most shocking facts was that there have been over 100,000 violations of the ceasefire. That is 100,000 too many, but 100,000 is an extremely large number. We should just think about what that really means for the people on the ground. Not only the conflict but also the resulting humanitarian situation, as the Assistant Secretary- General said, and the potential for long-term environmental damage are among the many reasons that the topic of Ukraine needs to be on the Council’s agenda and to be repeatedly discussed here. It is not just about Ukraine, although that is the subject of today’s meeting. I want to express my agreement with what my Swedish colleague said about Ukraine, Georgia and the rules-based international order. The situation on the ground remains highly volatile, as we heard. The deterioration in the security situation along the line of contact in Donetsk serves to underline the total failure of the latest recommitment to the ceasefire. I join others in repeating the appeals for respect for the laws of war. Despite being agreed by the Trilateral Contact Group on 26 March, it was only 10 minutes before Russian-led forces shelled Avdiivka, and they did so with weapons proscribed under the Minsk agreements. I think that demonstrates the complete disregard that the Russian-backed separatists have for the ceasefire and for attempts to grant some relief to the civilian population of eastern Ukraine. I would like to once again urge all those involved to recommit to the ceasefire at the Trilateral Contact Group meeting to take place on 30 May. The United Kingdom also remains extremely concerned by the threats posed to civilian infrastructure and the potential for long-term environmental damage. Many speakers today highlighted the Donetsk water- filtration station, and I would like to add our voices to that point. We are also concerned by the threats from the separatists to turn off the pumps at the Yunkom mine. Flooding of the mine risks contaminating the water table with radiological waste. More generally, I would like to urge Russia to intervene with the separatists to avoid actions that would cause environmental damage and which could have a huge humanitarian impact on the civilian population for years to come. Support and respect for the safe zones around key civilian infrastructure is crucial if we are to prevent further humanitarian suffering. And let us not see repeated the past winter, where despite international humanitarian assistance, as the Assistant Secretary-General said, food insecurity doubled from 600,000 to 1.2 million people. A number of speakers mentioned Crimea. We share the view that the annexation of Crimea four years ago by Russia is illegal and in violation of the first principle of international law. General Assembly resolutions 68/262, 71/205 and 72/190 reaffirm the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine and the absence of any legal basis to change the status of Crimea. The resolutions characterize Russia as an occupying Power. They note the primary responsibility of States to promote and protect human rights. And they call on Russia to uphold all of its obligations under applicable international law. Despite that, Russia continues to ignore calls in the General Assembly for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit Crimea, most recently in December last year. We heard from the OSCE and the United Nations how millions of Crimeans remain outside the monitoring mechanisms of the United Nations, which means that there is no one who can easily help them. We call on Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council, to uphold the international rules-based system and respond positively to the General Assembly’s calls. I would now like to turn to Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. I thank the Dutch Minister for his statement and for the important role the Dutch are playing, along with other members of the Joint Investigation Team, in pursuing justice for the victims and their families. Of the 298 victims, there were 10 British nationals. We commend the Joint Investigation Team for its professional, impartial and independent investigation. Like other colleagues, my Foreign Secretary is on record as saying we now have clear evidence that the missile that brought down Flight MH-17 belonged to the Russian Army. The United Kingdom fully supports the Netherlands and Australia in their request to the Russian Federation to accept State responsibility for its part in bringing down Flight MH-17 and to engage with them in bilateral negotiations. All States Members of the United Nations, including Russia, need to fulfil their obligations under resolution 2166 (2014) to provide any requested assistance to the investigation. Since 2014, over 10,300 people have been killed and 25,000 injured in Ukraine. Approximately 3.4 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, particularly along the line of contact. There are real risks of an environmental disaster. If Russia truly cares about the people of the Donbas, it should end the fighting that it started, withdraw its military personnel and weapons and cease support for the separatists, in line with its obligations under the Minsk agreements. And it should show political commitment, as Ambassador Apakan highlighted, to engage constructively and in good faith in negotiations to deliver long-term peace. ","Two weeks ago, the President of Poland convened a very important debate in the Security Council (see S/PV.8262) on upholding international law. Many of us talked about the purposes and goals of the United Nations. It was an opportunity to ask ourselves why we are here and what we hope to accomplish. Today’s debate effectively answers those questions. The conflict in Ukraine is a textbook example of the direct violation of the sovereignty of one Member State by another Member State. It is precisely the kind of flagrant misconduct this organ was created to address. When Russian forces entered the Crimean capital in 2014, it was a direct violation of the Charter of the United Nations. Russian forces seized the Parliament building and imposed an illegitimate referendum on the people. Since then, Russia has pushed into eastern Ukraine, creating a humanitarian crisis that threatens millions. In response to the resulting outcry, Russia signed the Minsk agreements, committed to a ceasefire, committed to countless truces, committed to a withdrawal of heavy weapons and committed to monitors to guarantee all of its commitments. Unsurprisingly, Russia has serially disregarded all of those promises and it has permitted, if not instructed, its forces to detain, threaten and even shoot at monitors, their vehicles, cameras and observation drones. In short, Russia has created a catastrophe of suffering in Ukraine. This is not a frozen conflict. The month of May has seen security conditions worsen, with the increased ceasefire violations, higher civilian casualties and growing military casualties. Adding to its complicity, the Kremlin has neglected every one of the dozens of previous ceasefire agreements. Russia insults our intelligence by telling us that this is a home-grown internal conflict, but everyone in this Chamber knows better. The militants in eastern Ukraine report directly to the Russian military, which arms them, trains them, leads them and fights alongside them. Russia’s combined forces in eastern Ukraine include thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles and heavy artillery. Despite its transparent denials, there is no doubt that Russia is driving the Ukrainian conflict. How do we know? Because the Russian forces work hard to conceal who is directing their actions and paying their wages. They strip patches and insignia off of their uniforms and equipment. They hide their identities behind face masks. But we know why they are there and we know who sent them. Russian soldiers have been captured by Ukrainian armed forces. Journalists have identified numerous examples of Russian military equipment being used by Russian-led forces in eastern Ukraine. Tragically, that includes the Russia-supplied missile system that shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in July 2014 — a civilian aircraft flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur — killing all 298 people on board. The victims include nationals of our Security Council colleagues: 193 citizens of the Netherlands, 10 British citizens and a dual-national American, among others. The families of the victims deserve answers. We welcome last week’s update from the international Joint Investigation Team, which has handled this case with professionalism and independence. We strongly support the call of Australia and the Netherlands for Russia to acknowledge its role in the tragedy, to cooperate and bring to account those responsible for shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight M H -17. Like its role in the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 tragedy, we ask Russia to acknowledge another reality that everyone here knows to be true: Russian soldiers are in Ukraine, not to “protect Russian-speaking Ukrainian nationals”, but to impose Russian control on the country. Let me emphasize that there is an urgent reason for making this request: the Russian Government holds the key to solving the crisis in Ukraine. The resolution of this conflict is not only possible; it is profoundly straightforward. Russia needs to withdraw its military forces and equipment, call on its proxies to honour the ceasefire and fulfil its commitments under the Minsk agreements. In Crimea, Russia needs to withdraw from the peninsula and restore it to Ukrainian control in line with Moscow’s multilateral and bilateral commitments. Russia can unilaterally fix this wrong, and the first step is acknowledging it. Until Russia ends its outrageous actions in Ukraine, the position of the United States will not waver. We condemn in the strongest terms Russia’s involvement in eastern Ukraine and its purported annexation of Crimea. Until Russia returns the Crimean peninsula to Ukrainian control, United States sanctions related to the invasion of Crimea will continue. Until Russia pulls its forces out of eastern Ukraine and honours its Minsk commitments, our sanctions in response to its flagrant misconduct in the eastern part of the country will stay in place. The United States, in close partnership with France, Germany and Ukraine, is weighing options to bring peace to eastern Ukraine. However, Russia has refused to engage meaningfully, and our efforts have been stalled since January. On 23 April 2017, Joseph Stone — an American — was working as a paramedic in eastern Ukraine. He was serving with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine in an area under Russian control. His vehicle was hit by an anti-tank mine. Joseph was killed. The tragedy of Joseph is joined by many others in Ukraine — we will not forget his sacrifice, just as Ukrainians will not forget the death and suffering of so many of their people. All those who respect and are committed to defend the United Nations and its Charter must join us in demanding justice for Joseph and for all of the victims in Ukraine. ",,,,,,,,,,,"Thank you, Mr. President, for convening today’s briefing and for your personal dedication to countering Russia’s aggression against my country. My appreciation also goes to the briefers for their important presentations. And needless to say, I want to thank other delegations for their strong expressions of solidarity and their united condemnation of the Kremlin’s revanchist policies.As the Russian representative began his statement, I thought he might have come to understand some important points, but as he started to reproduce Russian television’s standard narrative, I realized that normal service had been resumed. I can therefore now continue with my statement, because we know all too well how everything started — with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We do not need to repeat those facts.We all know that it is not only my compatriots whom the Russian troops on our territory are shooting and killing. Last week, Russia’s role in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 was clearly exposed by the investigators of the Joint Investigation Team. As we all knew, but for which we now have full proof, a Russian BUK missile system was brought from a military base near Kursk. It shot down a passenger airliner and then returned to Russia. I would like to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands for his important statement in that regard. As it happens, Russia’s reaction to the Joint Investigation Team’s announcement did not surprise me at all. We have seen the same attitude where the chemical attacks in Syria and Salisbury are concerned. First Russia denies everything and spreads dozens of versions that have nothing to do with reality. Once caught red-handed, it refuses to recognize the conclusions of investigative bodies under the pretext that it is not part of the investigations. It also complains about the fact that none of its weird versions of events are taken into consideration. Essentially, none of this is new, and that is a very sad thing.We have no doubt that the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 was a terrorist act. By 12 June, Ukraine will have submitted a memorandum to the International Court of Justice with additional evidence of Russia’s violations of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. The perpetrators of this and other crimes will be brought to account and justice will be assured.As we speak here today in this Chamber, violence continues to ravage Donbas. The conflict has left 4.4 million people in a very dire humanitarian situation, and the humanitarian cost continues to mount. People lack access to all basic services and goods. Everything — critical water, electricity and transport infrastructure — has been destroyed. The same goes for health facilities and services. Retired people are unable to receive their pensions, because the Government of Ukraine cannot reach them directly. They have to cross into Government-controlled areas of Ukraine to receive the money they are owed. Daily shellings and armed hostilities are a reality for more than 600,000 Ukrainians living on both sides of the contact line.The area, according to the United Nations, has already become the most mine-contaminated stretch of land in the world. One of the starkest reminders of the cost of Russia’s aggression came two weeks ago. On 18 May, the Russian occupation forces used 152mm calibre artillery to shell residential areas in the village of Troitske in the Luhansk region. Two civilians, one of whom was a child, lost their lives.With regard to all the ramifications of the Russians’ claim that they are not in Ukraine, I have a very simple illustration for the Security Council, a picture of Darya Kazemirova. Three days ago she turned 15, and just yesterday she was killed in the backyard of her house by a 122 mm shell, prohibited under the Minsk agreements and shot by Russian proxies. I would therefore like to ask the Russian representative if the shell is from the so-called latest humanitarian convoy, if the Russian proxies bought heavy ammunition and weaponry at the local supermarket, of if they have been able to manufacture reproductions of all the weaponry coming into Ukraine. Unfortunately, I am making a rhetorical point and do not need an answer, especially from the Russian Federation. That requires feeling some kind of responsibility.Ukraine continues to be fully committed to peace and the Minsk agreements, and we urge the Russian Federation to do the same and to cease its persistent denials of its responsibility as a party to the conflict. We have just heard the Russian Federation’s usual narrative, which really does have a devastating impact on the situation on the ground. The Russian shelling has resulted in many losses among military personnel and the civilian population. We are talking about hundreds of tanks, howitzers, and multiple rocket-launched grenades brought by Russia into the territory of Ukraine. And I do mean hundreds, most of which remain unaccounted for. They are often found camouflaged and hidden, kept ready for further violence.The activities of the Russian occupation authorities are already causing an ecological disaster in Donbas. The shootings carried out by Russia in the vicinity of the Donetsk water-filtration station have rendered this critical infrastructure facility totally inoperable. The occupation administration’s plans to shut off the pumps at the Yunkom mine, a site of Soviet nuclear tests in 1979, risk radioactive contamination of drinking water. Russia has even failed to provide the security guarantees necessary for repairing and maintaining critical civilian infrastructure along the line of contact.The Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is dealing with severe restrictions on its freedom of movement by Russia’s military forces and their proxies. The intimidation of observers is now totally normal and takes place on an almost daily basis with no reaction either from Moscow or its occupation administration. In a nutshell, we can see that Russia and its ongoing military activity in the occupied territories remain a fundamental obstacle to any sort of peaceful option.As soon as Moscow decides to stop the violence — and so far there has been no such decision — the conflict will end. I urge Russia to take that decision. One of the most important steps it can take is supporting the deployment of a full-fledged United Nations-mandated peacekeeping force throughout the occupied territory of Donetsk and Luhansk. We are confident that such an operation could contribute a great deal to establishing security, creating the conditions necessary for real progress on the implementation of the Minsk agreements, taking over responsibility on the ground and saving people’s lives. That will open the way for progress in implementing further steps under the Minsk agreement, and of course in organizing and holding local elections, which we definitely need. We have sent this message before, loudly and clearly, and I would like to reinforce it today, on the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers, which was in fact introduced at the initiative of Ukraine.We stand for the full integration of the entirety of our Donbas, and we will welcome our compatriots back. In December 2017, my Government approved the State programme for post-conflict recovery in the country’s eastern regions for the next three years. It focuses on boosting social and economic development in the conflict-affected areas, improving well-being and restoring normal life for the people who have suffered under the Russian occupation for the past four years. Naturally, in all this Ukraine is very grateful for the humanitarian assistance provided by agencies of the United Nations and bilateral partners. The 2018 United Nations humanitarian response plan will be even more instrumental in effectively addressing the needs of millions of those affected by the conflict in Donbas. If fully funded, it would help to make a substantial difference for at least 2.3 million people.In addition to highlighting the situation in the occupied territories of Donbas, it is really important that we maintain a special focus on Russia’s occupation of Crimea. The Russian Federation’s actions there constitute the most flagrant breaches of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations since the Second World War. They challenge the norms and rules of international law and create an atmosphere of fear and hatred. The occupation has resulted in the accelerated militarization of Crimea. Russia has more than doubled the strength of its military there and continues to prepare the Crimean military infrastructure for the deployment of nuclear weapons, including by refurbishing Soviet-era nuclear-warhead storage facilities. Today, in fact, Crimea is a huge military base that is often used for Russian interventions in distant lands, including Syria. The Syrian regime has returned the favour by sending a delegation to Crimea and by recognizing Georgian Abkhazia and South Ossetia, occupied by Russia, as independent republics.The occupation continues to be characterized by violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, the total suppression of any opposition and the systematic persecution of Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians — anyone who is against the occupation, basically — along with killings and forced disappearances, intimidation and attacks on Crimean Tatars and on Ukrainian identity and culture. Political prisoners are now a sad reality in Russian-occupied Crimea, as well as in Russia itself, as a matter of fact. My courageous compatriots are now fighting for their lives as well as for freedom and justice. On 14 May, Oleg Sentsov, a famous film director who has been thrown behind bars in Russia for opposing the illegal annexation of Crimea, addressed these very simple words to the people of Ukraine.“I, Oleg Sentsov, citizen of Ukraine, illegally sentenced by a Russian court and currently in prison in the city of Labytnangi, am declaring an indefinite hunger strike as of 14 Mary 2018. The only condition for its termination is the liberation of all Ukrainian political prisoners in the territory of the Russian Federation.”He added that he is ready to die for the freedom of those of his compatriots who have been illegally detained and sentenced in Russia. Vladimir Balukh, a political prisoner in Russian-occupied Crimea, has been on an indefinite hunger strike since 19 March in protest of his sentence on fake charges. The real reason for his prosecution is simply his pro-Ukrainian stance and the Ukrainian flag he flew in his private yard.Emir Usein Kuku, Nariman Memediminov, Seyran Mustafayev, Edem Semedlyaev, Yassir Arbelaev and many other Crimean Tatars have become special targets for repression by the occupying authorities. They now need the support of all those who value freedom and human rights. I would like to take advantage of this important opportunity to urge Council members and the wider United Nations community to join our call to Russia to free them. Russia continues to ignore the order that the International Court of Justice issued one year ago requiring it, among other things, to refrain from maintaining or imposing limitations on the ability of the Crimean Tatar community to preserve its representative institutions, including the Mejlis, as well as to ensure the availability of education in the Ukrainian language. Despite the order’s very clear wording, an entire year has passed in which Russia has continued its ban on the Mejlis and its disregard for all of the provisions of the relevant General Assembly resolutions on Crimea.This is all about denying access for international human rights monitoring missions, showing the utmost contempt for its obligations under international law as the occupying Power and continuing the practice of compelling Crimean residents to serve in the armed forces of the Russian Federation. These are examples of Russia’s response to the demands of international community. And the list of violations is practically endless. Just two weeks ago, on 15 May, Russia opened a bridge across the Kerch Strait. We strongly condemn its action and consider it yet another violation of our sovereignty. Ukraine is grateful to the countries that have already denounced this attempt to cement the illegal occupation of Crimea. We urge all other States and organizations, including the United Nations, to support that position.Russia is also trying to change the demographics of the peninsula. Since the occupation began the occupying Power has intentionally brought in a huge number of settlers. It has introduced settlers from a number of different regions and created intolerable conditions for the local population in an attempt to force them to leave. I want to remind the Russian delegation that this practice is a clear violation of the 1949 Geneva Convention. Time and again we have urged the Russian Federation to reverse its illegal occupation of Crimea and to stop its aggression, including by withdrawing its armed formations from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine and fully implementing its commitments under the Minsk agreements. Until that is done, the issue of Russian aggression should remain a high priority on the Council’s agenda.In conclusion, I would like to once again express my gratitude for the messages of solidarity with Ukraine expressed during this debate.There is one more item that I should mention and that the Russian delegate has also brought up. We have just received tragic news from Kyiv. Arkady Babchenko, a Russian journalist and a well-known opponent of the Russian regime, has been killed near his apartment in Kyiv. Before arriving in Ukraine, he was compelled to leave Russia following attacks and threats against him and his family. He went to Prague and after that Russia from Ukraine. Of course, Moscow has always considered him to be an enemy. Our police have already begun an investigation. It is too early to say who is behind the attack, but with our knowledge of similar cases, we have strong reason to believe that Russia is willing to employ this and other tactics to destabilize Ukraine through acts of terrorism, subversion and political assassination.I would like to thank everyone once again for their support and solidarity with Ukraine. It pains me to speak of this issue, which is such a matter of life and death for many of my fellow Ukrainians. There is nothing I would have wanted more than to be able to tell the Council that we reached a resolution to the conflict. But since an end is unfortunately nowhere near in sight, we will spare no effort to ensure that justice is served and that the Russian State bears full responsibility for its aggression and withdraws from all occupied territory, both in Donbas and Crimea.",,,,,,,,,,,"We should like to express our thanks for the convening of this meeting, and we welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland, Mr. Jacek Czaputowicz. We would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Polish presidency on its work during this month. We should also like to express our gratitude for the briefings of Mr. Ertuğrul Apakan and Ms. Ursula Mueller, and of Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo, who we believe will successfully fulfil her new duties at the head of the Department of Political Affairs.We also welcome the participation of Mr. Stephanus Blok, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and of Mr. Pavlo Klimkin, for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. We reiterate our commitment to defending the independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, in line with the Charter of the United Nations.Peru has been following with concern the complex and unstable situation in eastern Ukraine, as well as its serious implications for the country’s governance and development and for regional stability. The civilian population has endured deplorable suffering. In four years of conflict, more than 2,500 civilians have lost their lives, and 9,000 civilians have been injured. More than 4.4 million people are in dire need of humanitarian aid, of which more than 1.6 million are internally displaced.We must condemn the use of anti-personnel mines, which are banned under the Ottawa Convention, as well as the downing of the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, for which we must ensure proper accountability.Peru stresses that the Minsk agreements constitute the legal basis for the political solution required to end the conflict experienced in eastern Ukraine. In that regard, we support the package of measures for the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, which the Council endorsed in February 2015.We reiterate the need to comply with the ceasefire agreed by the parties and supported by the Council, as well as the withdrawal of heavy artillery, often located near populated areas. It is alarming that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine has recorded more than 80,000 violations of the ceasefire, many with weapons that should have been withdrawn, in just the past three and a half months.We highlight the work of the Special Mission and the need to facilitate its safe access on the ground. In line with the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes, we would also like to welcome efforts to facilitate dialogue between the parties, in particular within the framework of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group.I should like to conclude by welcoming the assistance that the international community, in particular the United Nations, lends in support of the efforts of the Ukrainian authorities to alleviate the suffering of the conflict-affected civilian population and to build sustainable peace.","I thank you, Mr. President, for the honour of presiding over our meeting today. I also welcome the presence of Mr. Stephanus Abraham Blok, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, and Mr. Pavlo Klimkin, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. I also thank Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo, Assistant Secretary-General Ursula Mueller and Ambassador Apakan for their excellent briefings on the situation in Ukraine.My country notes with regret the deterioration of the security situation in Ukraine. The recent upsurge in fighting along the line of contact in eastern Ukraine, which has resulted in the loss of human lives and the destruction of civilian infrastructure essential to the provision of basic social services to the population, is a challenge to the entire international community, and particularly to the Security Council. Above all, my delegation deplores the lack of progress in the implementation of the Minsk agreements, signed on 12 February 2015, including the recurrent violations of the ceasefire and the obstructions to the movement of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission. These facts undeniably constitute major obstacles to the implementation of the agreements, which to date remains the appropriate framework for resolving the crisis in Ukraine.Côte d’Ivoire, which is in favour of a peaceful resolution of the crisis in Ukraine, calls for respect for the ceasefire in force by the various parties involved, and above all for the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, within the framework of the Normandy format. My country also supports the efforts of the OSCE Monitoring Mission and the Joint Centre for Control and Coordination to de-escalate the conflict. Against that backdrop, my delegation calls on the parties to the conflict to take all appropriate steps towards the easing of tensions, in particular by enabling the Joint Centre for Control and Coordination to play its role in supporting OSCE monitors and following up on the ceasefire agreements.The humanitarian situation is also worrisome, given the resumption of fighting in eastern Ukraine since the beginning of May. The shelling has interrupted the gas and electricity distribution systems, affecting the living conditions of all of the people. Since the outbreak of the conflict, in 2014, civilians have suffered frequent water and electricity cuts around the line of contact and in internally displaced persons centres. On 18 April, 350,000 civilians had their water supply disrupted by damage to the Donetsk water filtration station. The station is still down and presents increased risks of contamination due to the numerous attacks to which it is subjected. My delegation condemns those acts, which constitute violations of international humanitarian law, and urges the parties to the conflict to safeguard critical water infrastructure and the provision of basic social services, such as water, gas and electricity.My country welcomes the efforts of the international community to fill the funding gap in the humanitarian response plan in eastern Ukraine, estimated at $186 million, to help the 2.3 million people in need of assistance in 2018.In conclusion, Côte d’Ivoire reiterates its support for all efforts to find a political solution to the crisis in Ukraine. To that end, it encourages all parties to respect the commitments they have undertaken with a view to ensure the effective implementation of the Minsk agreements and resolution 2202 (2015), of 17 February 2015, which supports those agreements.","Allow me to begin by welcoming the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Poland, Ukraine and the Netherlands. I would also like to thank Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs; Ambassador Ertuğrul Apakan, Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine; and Ms. Ursula Mueller, Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, for their comprehensive and detailed briefings on the political situation in Ukraine.The conflict in Ukraine is entering its fifth year. Ongoing ceasefire violations in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions are a source of concern for us, as they could spark tensions and cause the situation to deteriorate as a result of escalating violence in the east of the country. That, in turn, would undermine the efforts of the international community, including those of the Security Council, to find a peaceful solution to the crisis.The challenging work of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to maintain the ceasefire and reduce tensions requires the cooperation and efforts of the parties to the conflict. Their cooperation is essential to achieving a peaceful political solution to the crisis. We therefore call for an immediate ceasefire and request that both parties respect the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, as endorsed by resolution 2202 (2015), as the only path to stability in Ukraine.The impact of the violence and instability on the civilian population caused by the prolonged conflict is another source of concern. It generates economic losses in the region and exacerbates the suffering of the people, forcing some of them to leave their homes. We thank the humanitarian organizations for their work on the ground, and the Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and her team for their support and efforts in the region to provide assistance to those who need it most. We call upon the parties to the conflict to facilitate safe access for humanitarian workers on the ground to enable them to provide assistance to those in need and to improve people’s living conditions. Failing to do so would constitute a serious breach of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international law.In conclusion, we believe that the solution to the crisis is a peaceful one alone and that it can be achieved through direct, earnest and inclusive negotiations. The goal must be a definitive and just solution that attempts to foster harmonious relations among the various ethnic groups in Ukraine and between Ukraine and countries of the region. The solution to the crisis in Ukraine is not a military one; it is a political one. The international community must therefore continue to support all diplomatic efforts for a political solution to the crisis. ","We would like to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting and to commend you for presiding over it. We also welcome the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands and Ukraine to participate in this meeting.At the outset, we would like to thank the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo, the Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Ms. Ursula Mueller, and the Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, Ambassador Apakan, for their valuable briefings on the situation in eastern Ukraine.In this statement we will focus on the political, security and humanitarian situations. On the political and security situations, we express our concern about the renewed fighting in eastern Ukraine, especially with reports of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission documenting a large number of violations of the ceasefire agreement, using weapons that should have been withdrawn according to the Minsk agreements. The presence of such weapons, in an environment marred by lack of confidence and insecurity, contributes to the escalation of violence.Moreover, the Donetsk filtration station, which supplies drinking water to more than 300,000 people along both sides of the line of contact, is a case in point. In that regard, we call on all parties to immediately cease hostilities, fully abide by the ceasefire agreement and avoid any provocative acts that could lead to increased tension.The State of Kuwait stresses the importance of respecting the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. We hope that all parties will fully implement resolution 2202 (2015) and the Minsk agreements. The parties should also find a comprehensive and balanced solution to the crisis through dialogue, especially within the Normandy format. In that regard, we would like to commend the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission for its efforts on the ground, particularly its endeavours to facilitate the dialogue between all parties to the crisis. We would also like to urge Ukraine and the Russian Federation to find a peaceful solution to the crisis and demonstrate greater political will, not only to uphold the ceasefire and implement previous commitments but also to relaunch comprehensive and sustainable negotiations.With regard to the crime of the downing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, which claimed the lives of 298 innocent civilians, the State of Kuwait stresses the importance of abiding by resolution 2166 (2014), which calls for carrying out an international investigation according to the guidelines regulating international civil aviation. The resolution also demands that Member States cooperate fully with the efforts aimed at establishing accountability.On the humanitarian situation, more than four years into a crisis that has led to the killing and injuring of thousands of people, there are still 1.6 million internally displaced persons, half of whom are elderly. They are facing tremendous challenges, including a shortage of food, medicine, heating, and education for their children. There are 3.4 million people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection. The shelling along the 457 kilometre-long line of contact adversely affects the people living in the area, 40 per cent of whom suffer daily and directly as a result of the shelling. Nearly 1 million people who cross the line of contact every month — an area known to be the most contaminated by landmines in the world. We emphasize the need for ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid to all conflict-affected areas in order to improve the living conditions of the people, especially in the light of the continuing deterioration of the humanitarian situation.In conclusion, the State of Kuwait calls for finding a peaceful solution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine, in line with Security Council resolutions and the agreements signed between the parties concerned, including the Minsk agreements. These agreements represent the appropriate framework to settle the crisis in its regional dimension, and through mediation efforts by parties respected and recognized by both parties to the conflict and the international community at large. ","I thank Ms. Mueller for her briefing.I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland.To begin with, I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo, Ambassador Apakan and Assistant Secretary-General Mueller for their useful and comprehensive briefings.This year marks the fourth anniversary of the Revolution of Dignity, which was sparked by the will of Ukrainian people to be part of a broader community based on democracy, the rule of law, a flourishing civil society and a well-founded market economy. That will and that spirit will not be broken, neither by the illegal annexation of Crimea nor by the conflict in the east of the country. Those who thought that it would misunderstood not only the Ukrainian soul but also basic rules of democracy. Ukraine and its people have responded to brute force and direct aggression from its neighbour with a tremendous effort to reshape and modernize the country. I congratulate His Excellency Minister Pavlo Klimkin, his country and his people on making that effort.The Ukrainian conflict is lingering, and the world must not forget it. The aim of today’s meeting is to discuss the situation in Ukraine and possible ways to end the protracted conflict. We believe it is vital that Ukraine be present on the United Nations agenda, and we should not forget the Security Council’s primary responsibility, which is to maintain international peace and security, as stipulated in Chapter V, Article 24, of the Charter of the United Nations. That is a responsibility of all Security Council members — both permanent and elected.It is civilians who are paying highest price for the conflict in eastern Ukraine. As was stated by the briefers, over 2,800 civilians have been killed and many thousands wounded in the conflict so far. A number of people have lost their homes. Over 1.5 million are internally displaced.Civilians should be protected in line with international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Humanitarian actors must have access to the entire territory of Ukraine, including the zones outside of the Ukrainian Government’s control.We see a systematic human rights violation in Crimea, in which non-governmental organization activists and indigenous Crimean Tatars are especially being targeted. There are also numerous cases of unlawful or arbitrary detention, torture, ill-treatment and sexual violence in the area of conflict. Our utmost priority must be to stop those grave human rights violations.We believe in the United Nations role to defend the human rights of civilians. In that regard, we commend the work of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine and the role of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the exchange of detainees in eastern Ukraine in December 2017. The human rights violations that have taken place have been duly reported in the High Commissioner’s twenty-first report on the situation of human rights in Ukraine.At this juncture, I would like to underline that the December 2017 General Assembly resolution on the situation of human rights in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sebastopol (resolution 72/190) recognizes that there is an international armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia, and condemns the retroactive application of the Russian legal system in the occupied territory and the imposition of automatic Russian citizenship on Ukrainian citizens. The resolution urges Russia to fully implement the order of the International Court of Justice on interim measures to restore the rights and freedoms of Ukrainian citizens on the peninsula and calls on the Russian occupation authorities to ensure the availability of education in the Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar languages. It also calls on Russia to allow the unimpeded entry to Crimea of international human rights monitoring bodies. Humanitarian aid for Ukraine is a burning issue. Poland, along with its consistent support for Ukraine at the political level, has been providing humanitarian aid in the Kharkiv, Zaporizhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions to internally displaced people from the affected areas. Polish support is not limited to immediate life-saving assistance. Our initiatives also seek to integrate internally displaced people with their host communities and to give them an opportunity to function independently. I would like to express my appreciation for the work of the European Union Advisory Mission Ukraine. For over three years, the Mission has assisted the Ukrainian authorities in advancing a sustainable reform of the civilian security sector through strategic advice and practical support. Our goal is to make the civilian security sector efficient, accountable and trustworthy.International law has an important role to play as well. During the Council’s 17 May open debate on upholding international law (see S/PV.8262), the President of Poland, Mr. Andrzej Duda, stressed that only international law, its observance and enforcement can ensure peace and security. Unfortunately, international law is being violated in the case of Ukraine. Russia’s belligerent behaviour against a sovereign country and its illegal annexation of Crimea are glaring examples of flouting the basic principles and rules of international law embedded in the Charter of the United Nations, as well as the Helsinki Final Act, the Charter of Paris for a New Europe and the Budapest Memorandum. Moreover, the recognition of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol is in itself a violation of international law, as it constitutes an attempt to legalize an unlawful situation.Another breach of international law is the construction of the Kerch Strait Bridge, carried out by the Russian Federation without the permission of the Ukrainian State and contrary to the position adopted by the General Assembly in 2014 resolution 68/262, on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.Despite the steps taken by the international community so far, the military situation in eastern Ukraine remains very tense. The Minsk agreements require an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy military equipment in order to create a security zone. However, the agreements have been not honoured and have not prevented continuous fighting and the regular use of heavy weapons that severely disrupt the everyday life of the local population.Russia itself is a signatory to the Minsk agreements, but its actions on the ground undercut the diplomatic efforts to settle the conflict. It continues to finance, arm and train the militants. Russia is continuously and directly engaged in the fight — as we were reminded again by recent news on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, shot down over the territory of eastern Ukraine in July 2014, resulting in the deaths of almost 300 people.On 24 May, the Joint Investigation Team revealed that the missile launcher used to shoot down the plane came from the fifty-third anti-aircraft missile brigade of the Russian Armed Forces. We welcome the recent findings of the Joint Investigation Team as highly professional, impartial and independent. We reaffirm our support for resolution 2166 (2014) and call on all States to cooperate fully to meet its objectives. We also call on Russia to accept its responsibility in the matter and cooperate fully with the process.We believe Russia should walk back all moves that contravene the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and independence of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. Russia should use its influence over the militants in order for them to observe the ceasefire. It should withdraw heavy weapons, in accordance with the Minsk agreements, and allow the international community to provide humanitarian assistance to the local population. Solutions to settle the conflict, such as the Normandy format — made up of the representatives of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France — have not brought about the expected outcome.We notice the positive role and appreciate the efforts of the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), mainly through providing credible information to the international community and offering real assistance and services to the conflict-affected population. The Mission is made up of more than 700 people from 44 countries — thereby making it the largest and the most expensive OSCE mission ever. Poland has seconded 40 experts to the Special Monitoring Mission and will do its utmost to support the further strengthening of the Mission.I would like to express my appreciation to the Chief Monitor, Ambassador Apakan, for his dedication and tireless efforts towards conflict resolution. The Mission has continued to function despite the numerous cases of intimidation and attacks it endures. At this juncture, we urge Russia to return to the Joint Centre for Control and Coordination, which used to be an effective tool in increasing the security of the Mission.What should be the role of the United Nations be in this conflict? Given the stalemate in the political negotiations and the prolonged suffering of the local population, the United Nations should strive for the deployment of a fully fledged United Nations-mandated peacekeeping mission to the conflict zone. In that connection, we highly value the efforts of Ambassador Kurt Volker, United States Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations.The Mission’s mandate should ensure a sustainable de-escalation of conflict and the implementation of the Minsk agreements, facilitate the withdrawal of foreign armed formations, as well as supervise public order and the process of reintegration. The Mission should be able to effectively monitor the entire internationally recognized Russian-Ukrainian border and areas affected by the conflict, and to safeguard a secure environment to enable the holding of local elections.We also call for the appointment of a United Nations Special Envoy for Ukraine. That would be tangible proof of United Nations engagement in conflict resolution and would give new momentum to the peace process. The Envoy could monitor and report on the activities of United Nations agencies and specialized organizations on the ground.In conclusion, I reiterate that we believe that the efforts and dedication of the Ukrainian Government will allow ordinary Ukrainians to fulfil their ambitions and aspirations. Poland will continue to support Ukraine in order to facilitate that goal. We hope the rest of the world will do so as well.We believe the Security Council has a role to play in that regard too. The ongoing violence in eastern Ukraine and the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula remain one of the greatest sources of instability in the entire region. The Security Council should contribute to easing the tensions on the ground and working out a solution to the Ukrainian issue, including by establishing a peacekeeping mission and appointing a United Nations Special Envoy for Ukraine.We have to remain engaged constructively and actively and foster our efforts in order to ensure the territorial integrity of Ukraine in its internationally recognized borders.I now resume my functions as President of the Council.I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands.","My delegation would like to thank you, Sir, for being here and presiding over our meeting. We also express our gratitude for the presence of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands and Ukraine. We also express our gratitude for the briefings provided by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Ms. Rosemary DiCarlo; the Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine and the Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, Ms. Ursula Mueller.We express our concern about the continued tension in the region and call upon all parties to cease hostilities immediately, abide by the ceasefire, allow unconditional humanitarian access and facilitate full and safe access for the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine so that it can fully complete its monitoring tasks on the ground.We see that, despite the joint statement on 2 March by the Trilateral Contact Group where the parties reaffirmed their full commitment to a sustainable and unlimited ceasefire from 5 March 2018 onwards, there was once again incompliance with that pledge. In that regard, we call for the parties to abide by the prohibition of the use of heavy weapons and to strictly abide by resolution 2202 (2015), which endorses a package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements. The Minsk agreements continue to be the basis upon which the international community has committed itself to seeking lasting peace in eastern Ukraine. All of this is in line with the Security Council press statement of 31 January 2017 (SC/12700). Likewise we call for them to abide by the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and to fully abide by international humanitarian law.We believe that compliance with the stipulations of those agreements and the development of confidence-building measures are crucial to consolidate the efforts the parties must make to seek a political outcome to the crisis. In that regard, we call upon the Trilateral Contact Group and the Normandy quartet to resume the diplomatic process towards implementing the Minsk agreements.Successive violations of the ceasefire have had a devastating effect on the lives of millions of civilians. According to statistics from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, approximately 4 million people have been affected by the crisis, around 3 million of whom require humanitarian assistance. Moreover, attacks on urban areas and civilian infrastructure have affected 60 per cent of those living along the so-called contact line, which is 457 kilometres long and which is reportedly rapidly becoming one of the most mine-contaminated areas in the world. Such circumstances are exacerbated by harsh winter temperatures.In that regard, we call on all parties to comply with resolution 2365 (2017), on anti-mine action, which urges all parties to armed conflicts to bring an immediate and definitive end to the indiscriminate to use of explosive devices in violation of international humanitarian law. It also urges them to protect civilians, particularly children, from the threat posed by landmines, explosive remnants of war and improvised explosive devices.Along the same lines, we call on the parties to strictly adhere to their obligations on the protection of civilians, including resolution 2286 (2016), in compliance with international humanitarian law. We strongly condemn any act of violence, attacks or threats against civilians, hospitals, schools, health-care facilities and water and energy infrastructure, as well as attacks against humanitarian personnel, including doctors, who are risking their lives to help civilians.Furthermore, we commend the high-level meeting between the leaders of Russia and France on 24 May, where it was agreed to re-establish the joint working groups. We also applaud the meeting held between the leaders of Russia and Germany on 16 May to continue seeking a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Likewise, we firmly support the endeavours of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, which is conducting important work in difficult circumstances. We encourage it to continue with its monitoring activities.With regard to the possibility of creating a peacekeeping mission in eastern Ukraine, we believe it is imperative for the Security Council to remain united when establishing its mandate, if such a deployment were considered appropriate.Finally, I wish to state that there can be no military solution to this conflict. The international community and the Council must make every effort to achieve a lasting peace, which will, in the long term, be beneficial for the region. Above all, it must be the parties who resolve their differences with the assistance of their regional organizations. ","We are very pleased to see you, Mr. Minister, presiding over this important meeting. We also wish to welcome the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands and of Ukraine. We thank Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo, Assistant Secretary-General Mueller and Chief Monitor Apakan for their respective briefings on the latest situation in eastern Ukraine.We note the statement issued by the Special Representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Chairperson-in-Office in Ukraine and in the Trilateral Contact Group seven days ago expressing concern on the recent surge in combat activity along the line of contact in eastern Ukraine.We also understand the impact of the deteriorating security situation on civilians and critical infrastructure, and hence the need to respond to the humanitarian needs on the ground. We believe the implementation of the ceasefire regime, agreed to by the parties, is vital in de-escalating the increasing tension and helping address the needs of the civilian population. We also note the discussion on the possibility of deploying a peacekeeping mission, although there are major differences on the scope and mandate of the mission.There is no doubt that the resolution of the situation in the eastern region of Ukraine can be achieved only through a peaceful settlement. That is why it is absolutely imperative that the parties remain fully committed to the implementation of the Minsk agreements and strictly adhere to resolution 2202 (2015), which endorses the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements.It has been a while since the parties met in the Normandy format. We believe that the holding of the Normandy quartet could facilitate important discussions on the implementation of the Minsk agreements and help tackle outstanding issues in that regard. We note the bilateral meetings held recently by the Russian Federation with France and with Germany at the highest level. We hope they will pave the way for the convening of the Normandy quartet soon.Finally, on the issue of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, the continued cooperation of all States and actors in the region in bringing the matter to a conclusion remains extremely important, in line with resolution 2166 (2014), which the Council adopted unanimously. Let me end by saying that knowingly downing a civilian aircraft is totally incomprehensible to us and is a truly terrible crime.","My delegation welcomes you, Sir, and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands and of Ukraine to the Security Council. We express our appreciation to Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo and the Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, Ambassador Ertuğrul Apakan, as well as Assistant Secretary-General Ursula Mueller, for their comprehensive updates.Kazakhstan expresses its concern about the unpredictable and volatile situation in eastern Ukraine and the frequent ceasefire violations, which have a direct impact on the civilian population. Those violations result in deaths and injuries, along with many humanitarian consequences.The humanitarian situation in Donbas has worsened since the beginning of this month. We also note an increase in the use of heavy weapons, to the extent that more than 60 per cent of the people living along the contact line are affected by regular shelling. A considerable segment of the population does not have access to power, water or gas supplies. The deteriorating security situation in the wider area around the Donetsk filtration station poses a threat to the facility, its workers and monitors. We also express sincere concern for the fate of youth, women and all vulnerable groups, including internally displaced persons and refugees, half of whom are elderly.In that regard. Kazakhstan reiterates strong support for the activities of United Nations agencies and the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in the conflict area. We call for the immediate implementation by all sides of the framework decision on disengagement of the Trilateral Contact Group and welcome the results of its latest meeting, held in Minsk on 16 May. We also urge the parties involved to provide full, safe and unhindered access to the Special Monitoring Mission monitors in the conflict zone, which is an essential requirement as a confidence-building measure.Bearing in mind that strong political will remains a key precondition in the process of settling the Ukrainian crisis, we believe that there is no other alternative to resolving the crisis except through strictly peaceful means. That should be based on observance by all participants of their obligations, strictly complying with resolution 2202 (2015), on the Minsk agreements.We are also of the view that a further escalation of tensions should be prevented to avoid complicating the situation further. It is therefore necessary for all parties to withdraw their heavy weapons from the contact line. It is just as critical for United Nations agencies, regional organizations and the international community to stand ready to assist the population, support international mediation efforts and facilitate the negotiation process among all parties and their leaders, with a particular focus on revitalizing the Normandy format. All parties must therefore meet their obligations to provide free access to humanitarian assistance in the conflict zone.Of equal importance is the economic recovery of the south-east of Ukraine. We therefore propose that confidence-building measures be introduced in the economic sphere so as to support greater social stability for the region.Last week, the Joint Investigation Team presented its findings related to the investigation of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 over eastern Ukraine on 17 July 2014. We urge all the parties involved to pursue an objective, comprehensive and impartial investigation of the incident in accordance with the existing norms of international law and resolution 2166 (2014).","I thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting today. I would also like to thank the three excellent briefers. Their informative presentations highlight the ongoing need for international involvement, even four years since the start of the conflict. We have even seen a surge in violence in recent weeks, with new casualties as a result. That is why, Mr President, I am so grateful for your timely efforts to spotlight the situation in eastern Ukraine again today. The conflict must not be allowed to persist.Four years of fighting in Donbas has inflicted a heavy toll on many parties.First, it has taken a heavy toll on the people of Ukraine. More than 10,000 lives have been lost in that time. Many innocent civilians have had their daily lives disrupted; some lost their homes or became displaced. In parts of Donetsk and Luhansk, civilian infrastructure has been seriously damaged. The power and water supplies are insecure. Unexploded ordnance and mines are a daily threat.Secondly, a toll is being taken on the young Ukrainian democracy. We admire the steps taken by the current Ukrainian Government towards reform, as well as the positive role played by Ukraine’s vibrant civil society. But the conflict has put pressure on that young democracy and its economy. We call on the Government to continue its reforms, and we will continue to support the Ukrainian Government in its efforts bilaterally, through the European Union and in other international institutions.Thirdly, as I said in this same Chamber two weeks ago, this conflict is taking a toll on the international legal order (see S/PV.8262). In Ukraine, we find that our international rulebook is in jeopardy. The illegal annexation of Crimea and the active, destabilizing role of Russia in Donbas go directly against Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter of the United Nations: the prohibition of the use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of any State. Like others, I therefore reiterate our strong commitment to the sovereignty, political independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine. As the Council is well aware, it is not only the people of Ukraine who have been affected by the conflict. On 17 July 2014, 298 innocent people from 17 different countries were dragged into this conflict and lost their lives. On that fateful day, a Malaysia Airlines civilian airliner travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down over eastern Ukraine from a location controlled by Russian-backed separatists. One hundred and ninety-six of those victims were citizens of the Netherlands — men, women and children from my country.The Security Council responded immediately, with the unanimous adoption of resolution 2166 (2014), proposed by Australia, which was one of the countries most affected. I also want to remind the Council that our efforts to establish an international tribunal under Chapter VII, through the Council, were blocked by a Russian veto.My Government announced that it would not rest before the truth was established and justice was achieved, together with its international partners. Years of painstaking, independent international investigations followed. As a result, it has now been established that the missile that downed Flight MH-l7 was launched by a Buk TELAR that came from the Russian Army. That conclusion was not taken lightly. It is the result of intensive, in-depth study and analysis.Last Thursday, the Joint Investigation Team released additional findings — based on legally sound and compelling evidence — that the Buk missile system that downed Flight MH-17 belonged to the fifty-third anti-aircraft missile brigade of the Russian Army.On that basis, and motivated by our desire to establish the truth and achieve justice and accountability, Australia and the Netherlands announced last Friday that we hold the Russian Federation accountable for its part in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17.As a consequence, the Netherlands and Australia now call on the Russian Federation to engage seriously and constructively with us in this matter and accept its responsibility. Along with that, the Russian Federation needs to start cooperating fully with the Joint Investigation Team’s ongoing criminal investigation.That request is nothing new. Indeed, it is a clear demand set out in resolution 2166 (2014), which I have in front of me and which was unanimously adopted by the Council almost four years ago. By voting for that resolution, all 15 members of the Council, including the Russian Federation, voted for justice. They voted for those responsible to be held to account, and for all States to cooperate fully with efforts to establish accountability. Unfortunately, four years later, those demands need to be repeated. I reiterate them yet again today, supported by a massive amount of irrefutable evidence.When it comes to establishing truth and accountability for what happened to Flight MH-17, no State has the right to remain silent. Quite the contrary: all States have a duty to cooperate constructively, to shed light on the truth and not to obscure it with continuous mist. I call on the Russian Federation to take that responsibility.For our part, we have kept the Council informed of our efforts and findings on a regular basis, and we will continue to do so. We are grateful for the broad support that we have enjoued throughout from the vast majority of the international community, including from Australia, the United Nations Secretary-General, the NATO Secretary General, all our European partners and countries such as Canada, New Zealand, Ukraine, Malaysia and the United States.In conclusion, the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 is a stark reminder of how an armed conflict in any part of the world can impact any of us, at any time. That is another reason why the international community cannot allow this conflict to persist. After four years of devastation, Ukraine deserves peace, lasting peace, on the basis of the Minsk agreements, supported by all of its neighbours and in accordance with international law. So too, do the victims of Flight MH-17 deserve justice. We have heard the remarks of the representative of the Russian Federation with regard to Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, but we actually heard nothing new. We are aware that Russia’s spokespersons and State-controlled media routinely try to discredit details of the investigation, call into question the independence, professionalism and impartiality of the Joint Investigation Team and continue to spread impossible alternative theories about the downing of Flight MH-17. For the relatives of the victims, that is extremely painful. It is very disappointing that even in this Chamber, Russia’s representative has not acknowledged the hard facts that the Joint Investigation Team has established based on irrefutable evidence. So far, the Russian authorities have not shown the slightest interest in achieving truth, justice and accountability, as demanded by resolution 2166 (2014).I would also like to remind the Council that our efforts to establish an international tribunal through the Council under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations were blocked by a Russian veto. To us, that shows how important it is that Russia enter into bilateral talks with the Netherlands and Australia, since they are the proper forum in which to discuss Russia’s responsibility for its part in the downing of Flight MH-17. We therefore urge the Russian Federation to accept our invitation to engage in such talks in relation to the State’s responsibility for its part in the downing of Flight MH-17 on 17 July 2014.","I thank the briefers for their excellent input in today’s discussion. I should like to express our appreciation to the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and of Ukraine for being present here today. We very much welcome this opportunity to discuss the situation in eastern Ukraine, and we want to thank the Polish presidency for scheduling this very important briefing.The redrawing of borders — backed by military power — as we have seen not only in Ukraine but also in Georgia, represents a threat that goes beyond Europe. When a State decides to challenge the international legal order and the Charter of the United Nations as such, it constitutes a threat to us all. Security is not a zero-sum game, and the rules-based order can function only when everyone adheres to the rules.We are deeply concerned over the recent escalation of violence and the deteriorating humanitarian and human-rights situation in Donbas. Casualties, heavy shelling, damaged critical infrastructure and imminent environmental disasters underline how civilians are bearing the heaviest burden. Almost 3.5 million people are now affected by conflict and need humanitarian assistance. The thousands of Ukrainians living along the contact line are in particular need. It is crucial that humanitarian actors be given full, safe and unhindered access to people in need of humanitarian assistance, as has been stated by many around the table today.We call for an immediate and full implementation of the Minsk agreements, and we support efforts within the Normandy format to that end. Our full support for those efforts does not alter the fact that Russia’s continuous aggression against Ukraine is the origin of the conflict, and that Russia has the influence to end it whenever it so chooses. The withdrawal of foreign armed formations, military equipment and mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine, as well as the restoration of Ukrainian control over its State border, remain crucial.Sweden will welcome, and be ready to contribute to, a possible United Nations mission in Donbas. However, such a mission must, from the outset, cover the entire occupied area of Ukraine, including the Russia-Ukraine border, and have as its clear aim the restoration of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.We strongly support the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine. It is unacceptable that the Mission’s monitors continue to be intimidated, denied access and to have their equipment destroyed, primarily in areas held by Russian-backed armed groups. We call on Russia to use its influence over the armed groups it supports to ensure the Special Monitoring Mission’s full, safe and unhindered access throughout Ukraine, including along the Russia-Ukraine State border and to the Crimean peninsula.The recent holding of presidential elections in illegally annexed Crimea and the inauguration of the Kerch Bridge, connecting the peninsula to mainland Russia, constitute clear breaches of international law. The European Union and Sweden will continue to remain firm in applying a non-recognition policy regarding Crimea, including through sanctions.Human-rights monitors consistently report on the deteriorating human-rights situation in Crimea, where torture, kidnapping and house searches have become commonplace. Full, free and unrestricted access for international human-rights actors to the whole territory of Ukraine, including Crimea, continues to be paramount. We welcome the yearly General Assembly resolution on the situation of human rights in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sebastopol, Ukraine, and its bold support.As the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands reminded us today, 298 human lives were lost in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. That was a heinous crime that constitutes an unacceptable violation of international law. On 24 May the independent and impartial Joint Investigation Team concluded beyond doubt that the BUK missile system used to bring down the flight belonged to the armed forces of the Russian Federation, based in Kursk. We condemn that tragedy and call upon the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility to cooperate fully with the ongoing international criminal investigation in order to establish accountability and to provide full reparations for the injury caused by those unlawful acts. We reiterate our support for resolution 2166 (2014). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S/PV.8276,06/06/2018,,,,"The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. After consultations among Council members, I have been authorized to make the following statement on their behalf: “The Security Council expresses grave concern about the recent deterioration of the security situation in eastern Ukraine and its severe impact on the civilian population. “The Security Council condemns continuous violations of the ceasefire regime, especially the use of heavy weapons prohibited by the Minsk Agreements, responsible for tragic deaths, including among civilians, and calls for the implementation of disengagement commitments and the immediate withdrawal of heavy weapons in accordance with relevant provisions of the Minsk Agreements. “The Security Council welcomes the work of the United Nations agencies in order to address the tragic humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine and emphasizes the need for scaling up efforts to alleviate suffering of the civilian population affected by the conflict. “The Security Council expresses its full support to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission and calls on all the parties to facilitate its work, including safe and secure access throughout Ukraine, to fulfil its mandate and guarantee the safety of its staff and protection of its equipment. “The Security Council recalls its full support for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, underlines the need for strict compliance with resolution 2202 (2015), which endorsed the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk Agreements, and encourages all the parties to recommit to the peace process and to implement all the measures agreed in the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group in order to achieve immediate progress in the implementation of the Minsk Agreements. “The Security Council reaffirms its full support for resolution 2166 (2014) on the downing of flight MH-17.” This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2018/12.

S/PV.7876,02/02/2017,Deterioration of the situation in Donbas due to the increased number of shellings in Donbass.,"I thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman; Ambassador Apakan, Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine; and Under-Secretary-General O’Brien for their briefings. China has been following the situation in eastern Ukraine closely, and is concerned about the recurring hostilities that have resulted in civilian casualties. We have taken note of the fact that the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group in Minsk held consultations on the implementation of the Minsk agreements and promoting a peaceful resolution to the Ukranian issue. We call on the parties to the conflict to strictly abide by the ceasefire regime and remain committed to a political solution. There must be a fundamental and long-term solution to this conflict that will both accommodate the legitimate rights and aspirations of all regions and ethnic groups and address the reasonable concerns of all the parties concerned, in order to strike a balance among the interests of all sides. China is of the view that all parties should fully implement resolution 2202 (2015), enforce the cessation of hostilities and violence and implement the Minsk agreements. They must remain committed to seeking a comprehensive, lasting and balanced solution to the Ukranian issue through dialogue and consultation, so as to help achieve peace, stability and development in Ukraine, harmonious relations among all ethnic groups and peaceful coexistence between Ukraine and countries of the region. The international community should continue to support every diplomatic effort for a political solution. Council discussions on the issue should contribute to the easing of tensions on the ground and a proper solution to the Ukranian question. ","France firmly condemns the resumption of fighting in eastern Ukraine in the past few days, specifically in Avdiivka. We are dealing with the worst upsurge in violence and the highest rate of violations of the ceasefire that we have seen in months. They have been accompanied by a spike in the number of victims, including among civilians, as well as a serious deterioration in the humanitarian situation, which we are following closely. We are forced to conclude that neither the security or the humanitarian situation has improved since the consultations we had on the subject two days ago, despite the fact that the Council called unanimously for the immediate restoration of the ceasefire (SC/12700). In that regard, France calls on all the parties to exercise restraint, and supports the appeal of the Trilateral Contact Group for the immediate restoration of the ceasefire in accordance with terms of the Minsk agreements, in particular with respect to the prohibition against the use and withdrawal of heavy weapons. The disengagement of forces on both sides of the line of contact must also be implemented without delay. We expect each of the parties to refrain from any provocation that maight further aggravate the situation. We also call on Russia to use its influence with the separatists. The work of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission in support of the ceasefire and de-escalation is essential. We call on all the parties on the ground to ensure the access and security of OSCE observers in Avdiivka, as well as in all areas of the conflict, as established in the mandate of the Mission. The humanitarian situation is of particular concern to us, as the civilian population is facing extreme weather conditions and a disruption to the supply of water and electricity in several areas, including Avdiivka. We urge the parties to act as quickly as possible to improve the living conditions of the civilian population on the ground. Immediate compliance with windows of calm is essential to enable the repair of critical infrastructure in areas affected by fighting and for the relief of populations. We believe that to be crucial. The current crisis also calls to mind the crucial importance of the ongoing presence of humanitarian agencies throughout Ukrainian territory, including in areas beyond the control of the Government. Faced with the new resurgence in violence, France recalls that the solution to the crisis in Ukraine cannot be a military one; rather, it must be political. That is why the implementation of the Minsk agreements remains more than ever the only way forward for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. France and Germany remain fully engaged in their diplomatic efforts within the framework of the Normandy format. Although we are aware of the scale of the work that remains to be done and the challenges to be overcome, we are convinced that working in that format, the only one to bring Ukraine and Russia together around the same table at the political level, is necessary and must be continued. In particular, work in the Normandy format has made it possible in recent months to lessen the intensity of the fighting and reduce the number of human casualties on the ground, as well as to implement confidence-building measures in the security and humanitarian spheres, with respect to the re-establishment of the ceasefire, the implementation of areas of disengagement or even the carrying out of exchanges of prisoners. Despite continued fighting, the number of civilian casualties remains six times lower since the signing of the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements, according to estimates by United Nations agencies. Our efforts are currently focused on developing a common road map that would enable concomitant progress with respect to the security and political aspects of the Minsk agreements. We can make progress only by moving forward on those two tracks. It is the shared belief of France and Germany that this is now the only way forward and that the European sanctions implemented at the beginning of the crisis are linked to the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. For France, a resolution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine is more than ever a major priority. Alongside Germany, we will continue tirelessly in our efforts to mediate within the framework of the Normandy format, for there is currently no viable alternative and because every result on the ground counts. Our goal remains the restoration of Ukrainian control over all of its internationally recognized borders, which, we recall, can take place only via the re-establishment of its authority over Crimea. In this challenging environment, everyone must now shoulder their responsibilities and fulfil their commitments. In our view, that is the main message the Council should send, and it is the spirit with which we are prepared to consider any draft presidential statement that may be adopted by the Council. ","We are grateful for today’s briefings, which painted a disturbing picture of the ongoing events and suffering of the people of eastern Ukraine. What has basically been happening is quite obvious. Kyiv is attempting to use clashes it has itself provoked as a pretext for a complete refusal to implement the Minsk agreements, signed on 12 February 2015 and endorsed in resolution 2202 (2015). However hard the Ukrainian side tries to portray things differently, including by convening this meeting of the Council and making statements that turn the facts upside down, there is a massive amount of information, including open admissions by Ukrainian officials right up to the level of the country’s President, that is too overwhelming to permit denial of the destructive policies of Kyiv and its armed forces. On 3 January, Ukraine’s Defence Minister Poltorak confirmed that the Ukrainian armed forces had seized new positions in the grey zone, with the demagogic claim that that did not violate the Minsk agreements because the occupied territories thereby belonged to Ukraine. On 17 January, Interior Minister Avakov, speaking to Ukrainian border guards, urged them to prepare to seize the State borders in 2017. On 22 January, President Poroshenko declared publicly that Ukraine would not be doing anything about political reform until it regained full control of its border with Russia, in an approach that completely perverts the content of the Minsk package of measures and deliberately renders them unrealizable, practically speaking. Lastly, yesterday Deputy Defence Minister Pavlovsky completed the picture by bragging to the press that his heroic lads were moving forward where they could, metre by metre, step by step. That overtly militaristic rhetoric has had very real consequences, as is clearly apparent from the latest reports of the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Observers have confirmed that the escalation was provoked by Ukrainian security forces. On the night of 27 and 28 January, the Mission’s camera at the Oktyabrskaya mine recorded intense crossfire between the Ukrainian armed forces and militias, which was preceded by firing from the north-west to the south- east, that is, from the security forces’ positions. At the same time, another Special Monitoring Mission camera captured an intense artillery exchange in Avdiivka that began with five shots fired from north to south, which also meant from Ukrainian forces’ positions. The next night, 28 and 29 January, a Mission camera in Avdiivka recorded 15 shots fired from a north-westerly direction towards the south-east, also from the Kyiv security forces’ side, bombarding the militias’ positions. That was followed by hours of fighting in the Avdiivka industrial zone. The picture on the southern flank was the same. According to the Mission camera in Shyrokyne, intense crossfire on the night of 28 January was preceded by 20 shots fired from west to east, that is, again from the Ukrainian forces’ positions towards the rebels’ territory, after which another battle ensued. According to Mission data for 26 to 29 January, indiscriminate shelling of residential areas under rebel control, coming from areas where Ukrainian security forces were deployed, injured civilians in Brianka and destroyed more than a dozen houses in Brianka, Donetskyi, Olenivka, Zaichenko, Kalynove, Novooleksandrivka and Pervomaiske. The Mission continued to observe Ukrainian forces’ military equipment in the security zone. Between 26 and 29 January observers discovered four tanks in Avdiivka and three howitzers in Mykolaivka, as well as the disappearance from the security forces’ storage of 76 tanks, 10 mortars and 18 field guns. Only about 6 per cent of the stored military hardware was actually there. Thus began a new spiral of tensions that since then has only been ratcheted up further. According to yesterday’s Special Monitoring Mission report, the number of violations has risen daily, reaching 10,300 shell explosions in a span of 24 hours. At the same time, the statistics on restrictions to the Mission’s access speak for themselves — in seven of nine cases it was the Ukrainian forces that put obstacles in its way. The numbers testify to the fact that, rather than attempting to normalize the situation in the Donbas region and arrive at reasonable compromises within the Normandy format and the framework of the Trilateral Contact Group, the Ukrainian authorities are desperately trying to achieve a military solution to the conflict. Another attention-grabbing feature is the fact that any serious deterioration of the situation in the Donbas region, amazingly, coincides with foreign visits on the part of Ukraine’s leadership. Evidently that is how Kyiv hopes to keep its self-created crisis on the international agenda while at the same time roping in newly elected Heads of Government with its reckless, confrontational policies. But, of course, the Ukrainian leadership needs money, which it hopes to extract from the European Union, various European countries, the United States and the international financial institutions by setting itself up as a victim of aggression. Kyiv seems not to worry very much about the humanitarian cost of such a policy. It is actively using heavy types of armaments around village residential areas, schools and hospitals, including heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, which according to the Minsk package of measures of 12 February 2015 should have been withdrawn from the contact line long ago. Civilians are among those killed and wounded. Thanks to Ukrainian security forces’ attacks, the Donetsk filtration station and the Avdiivka coke plant have been damaged and mineworkers’ lives threatened. In order to prevent a humanitarian disaster and get the situation back on a political track, the international community must be firm and consistent. In that regard, the Security Council sent an important message on 31 January (SC/12700) when it united in calling for an immediate ceasefire and strict respect for the Minsk package. Yesterday the Trilateral Contact Group made an announcement in the same spirit when it called for full compliance with the ceasefire regime and the withdrawal of the heavy weaponry that comes under the Minsk agreements. We expect to see effective action from the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission aimed at de-escalating the situation as soon as possible. The Normandy format participants, and those who can exert the most influence on Kyiv, have a particular responsibility in that regard. We hope that the forces of common sense in Ukraine itself, as well as those who are interested in resolving such situations by political means, will not allow the situation in south-eastern Ukraine to turn into a worst-case scenario, but will instead focus their attention and efforts on ensuring that the Minsk agreements are fulfilled. Today President Poroshenko said that he had personally ordered the Ukrainian delegation to convene today’s Council meeting. When he called to order today’s meeting, the Permanent Representative of Ukraine proposed drafting a Security Council document building on the statement we issued on 31 January. Sadly, the unbridled, odious statement we heard today from Ukraine shows that the Ukrainian delegation here in New York is continuing on the path of war, which is deeply regrettable. Our meeting is drawing to a close, and I am now perhaps within my rights, as doyen of the Security Council, to welcome our new United States colleague, Ambassador Nikki Haley. From time to time we may have differences on particular issues, but her efforts will greatly influence the Council’s ability to effectively carry out its collective functions as the body with the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. I would therefore like to wish her every success. In her statement, Ambassador Haley touched on the issue of Crimea. In that connection, I would like to remind her that it was the United States Constitution that proclaimed those marvellous, historic words “We the people”. The people of Crimea clearly expressed their will in a referendum in which 93 per cent of the population voted for reunification with Russia, from which Crimea had been unjustly and unlawfully severed. And, by the way, that expression of the people’s will has subsequently been confirmed in a number of public opinion surveys conducted by Western organizations. Still on the issue of Crimea, however, it is the representative of the United Kingdom, as aggressive as ever, who for some reason persists in saying that the crisis in Ukraine began with Crimea. I am compelled yet again to recall that the whole thing began with a coup that owed a great deal to external support. Here is my advice to the representative of the United Kingdom about his position. Give back the Malvinas; give back Gibraltar; give back the part of Cyprus that was annexed; give back the Chagos archipelago in the Indian Ocean, which has been turned into a huge military base. Perhaps then his conscience will be a little clearer and he will be able to speak to other topics. While we sometimes have to deal in controversy, I believe nonetheless that our job as diplomats in the Security Council is to adopt resolutions and see to it that they are strictly implemented. Ten days from now we will observe the second anniversary of the adoption of the Minsk package of measures and the corresponding agreements, while 17 February is the second anniversary of the Council’s adoption of resolution 2202 (2015), giving the Minsk agreements international legal status. From time to time, we hear that Russia is not fulfilling the Minsk agreements; but the President of Ukraine says that the military provisions of the Minsk agreements must be complied with before the political ones are dealt with. It is not hard to figure out who is right and who is wrong here. All we have to do is look at a Security Council document — the same resolution 2202 (2015), to which the package of measures is attached as annex I. It contains some very simple propositions that we can all understand. Regarding the relationship between military and political measures, paragraph 9 of the annex provides for “Reinstatement of full control over the State border by the Government of Ukraine throughout the conflict area, starting on day 1 after the local elections and ending after the comprehensive political settlement ... provided that paragraph 11 has been implemented in consultation with and upon agreement by representatives of certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the framework of the Trilateral Contact Group.” That means that certain military steps should start only after various political measures have been implemented. Now, what are those conditions in paragraph 11 that have to be implemented? Paragraph 11 provides for “Carrying out constitutional reform in Ukraine with a new constitution ... providing for decentralization as a key element ... as well as adopting permanent legislation on the special status of certain areas in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in line with measures as set out in the footnote”. And the footnote clearly sets out the eight measures that must be taken in order to ensure special status for south-eastern Ukraine. They are extremely precise. The President of France, who made a very active and substantive contribution, and the Chancellor and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, who made a number of proposals that were then agreed to by everyone, did not spend 17 hours drafting them in vain.. There can simply be no arguing here. And, logically, who could suggest or expect that Donetsk and Luhansk should close off their borders and allow themselves to be walled in? And then what? Throw themselves on the mercy of the Kyiv authorities? Can the citizens of Donetsk and Luhansk trust the Kyiv authorities? At one point — I believe it was 1 July 2014 — President Poroshenko appeared on Ukrainian television and said that the citizens of Donetsk and Luhansk were so beloved in Kyiv that there would be no heavy-artillery shelling of residential areas during their anti-terrorism operations. He said that his valiant warriors had other ways of recovering those territories and that they would not be shelling residential areas with heavy weapons. Since then, Mr. Apakan can confirm that not a single day has passed when residential areas have not been shelled targets, while high-rise buildings are fired on one day and then fired on again the next. Take the photograph that Ambassador Yelchenko showed us today. If it is a picture of a ruined building in Avdiivka, of course it is terrible. But he could have brought similar photos of other areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as many as you like. Why did he not do that? Yes, of course, Ukrainian soldiers have died in the fighting, and there is nothing good about that. But most of those who have died on the Donetsk and Luhansk side have been civilians, including women and children. Why not talk about them? Of course we could draft some document, but if we are serious people representing serious Governments, especially the Governments that have been directly involved in the process, by the way, let me point out to dear Ambassador Haley that we know how they respect the American authorities in Kyiv, which means that in this regard the American authorities can have some very serious influence on the developing situation. All that is needed is to call for the implementation of the relatively simple provisions in the Minsk package in order to restore Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. And yet Kyiv’s actions are in fact bringing about the destruction of its territorial integrity. Ambassador Yelchenko says that the local people cannot do this, cannot wreak such destruction, and so forth. But can the local Ukrainians on the Ukrainian side wreak such destruction on Donetsk and Luhansk? It seems that they can. Do they not consider these Ukrainian citizens their brethren? While that would be very sad, we know that that is exactly what some hotheads in Kyiv think and believe. I would like to appeal to the common-sense section of the Ukrainian political spectrum. But I repeat that, needless to say, without major influence from those on the external factor side, the Normandy format and others, none of this will succeed. Because they will simply deceive their own people with unsubstantiated claims that own population that Kyiv has somehow complied with the Minsk agreements. They say that they are recapturing their country, metre by metre. How many people will have to die as they progress metre by metre from Avdiivka to the Ukrainian border? How many Ukrainian soldiers and civilians will have to die? And this at a time when a political alternative exists, agreed to at the highest level, and including President Poroshenko’s participation two years ago. While it is therefore regrettable that what we heard today from the Ukrainian delegation was totally irresponsible, I hope that our frank discussion will still enable those who really want to resolve the Ukrainian crisis to look at things more objectively and push Kyiv into taking the steps that are essential to establishing peace in Ukraine. It would certainly be a tragedy if the situation we have faced in the past two or three years should drag on any longer. ","Let me take this opportunity to welcome you, Sir, in your role as President of the Security Council for the month of February. I commend you for the start that you have made, and I support your proposal for a draft presidential statement on this important issue. As our briefersmade clear, Sir, we begin your presidency — sadly — in troubling times for eastern Ukraine. The worrying upsurge in fighting in that part of your country should concern us all. It is claiming yet more lives, both civilian and military. It is aggravating the suffering of those living there, forcing more to flee their homes. There is no end in sight. In cities such as Avdiivka, people talk of an endless salvo of artillery and rockets. They talk of failing electricity and falling temperatures, of burying loved ones in the snow. And those events have not come out of the blue. They are not new. The Council knows all too well the root causes of this violence and instability. This is what happens when Russia disregards the sovereign right of Ukraine to choose its own destiny. This is what happens when Russia undermines the territorial integrity of Ukraine by illegally annexing Crimea. This is what happens when Russian military personnel stand side-by-side with separatists whom they have equipped, armed and trained. And, this is a reality that the Security Council cannot, must not, accept. We need urgent action to bring an end to this upsurge in violence before it spirals out of control. I want to pay tribute to the efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Joint Centre for Control and Coordination to bring about a truce to allow crucial repairs. Theose efforts will help to restore vital utilities and to allow for the evacuation of civilians. I urge all parties to support those efforts and to facilitate access to the area for humanitarian actors. But such actions are just a band-aid on a bullet wound. For any fragile short-term truce to become a comprehensive and sustained cease-fire, all parties most show restraint. That means in particular ending the extensive use of high-caliber indiscriminate weapons, such as Grad rocket systems. The use of those weapons, from and against civilian areas, is not only in disregard of the Minsk agreement; it is also an abhorrent rejection of the norms of conflict. They must be withdrawn from the line of contact, as stipulated in the Minsk agreements. We also need to tackle the underlying causes of the fighting. It is clear that any solution to the Ukraine crisis must be political, not military, as we all recognized in resolution 2202 (2015). The Minsk agreements are the only meaningful path to long-term peace in Ukraine. Let us therefore urge all sides to recommit to meeting their full obligations under the Minsk agreements. We support the continued efforts of France and Germany within the Normandy format towards securing full implementation, and we are extremely grateful for the enormous investment that they have made in the process to date. Let me conclude with this final thought. We frequently hear from the Russian Government — as we did today — that all the problems in eastern Ukraine are the consequences of actions by the Ukrainian Government. That is simply not the case; it is an inversion of reality. The responsibility for the inception and continuation of the conflict in eastern Ukraine lies squarely with Russia and the separatists it supports. As the British Prime Minister made clear in Washington, D.C., last week, the United Kingdom will continue to stand by Ukraine in full support of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Most recently, the international community — through the General Assembly resolution on the situation in Crimea in December — sent the same clear message to Russia. And earlier this week, the entire Security Council, including Russia, expressed the very same thing in an agreed statement (SC/12700): that we support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. But Russian words are not the same as Russian deeds. We need to see Russia comply with its Minsk commitments. We need to see Russia stop equipping and arming the separatists and, instead, use its influence to make sure the separatists meet their Minsk obligations. And we need to see Russia withdrawing its force from all of Ukraine. That includes Crimea, the illegal annexation of which we do not, and will not, recognize. Sanctions against Russia cannot be lifted until that happens. It is for the people for Ukraine to decide their country’s future. Ukraine must be allowed to make its own sovereign decisions. ","I thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman, Under-Secretary- General O’Brien and Ambassador Apakan for their useful and comprehensive briefings today. This is my first appearance in the Chamber as the Permanent Representative of the United States. It is an immense honour for me to sit behind the United States placard and to follow in the footsteps of so many giants of American diplomacy. It is humbling to be part of a body whose responsibility is nothing less than maintaining international peace and security. I look forward to working closely with all Council members. The United States is determined to push for action. There is no time to waste. I consider it unfortunate that the occasion of my first appearance here is one in which I must condemn the aggressive actions of Russia. It is unfortunate because it is a replay of far too many instances over many years in which United States representatives have needed to do that. It should not have to be that way. We do want to better our relations with Russia. However, the dire situation in eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions. The sudden increase in fighting in eastern Ukraine has trapped thousands of civilians and destroyed vital infrastructure. And the crisis is spreading, endangering many thousands more. The escalation of violence must stop. The United States stands with the people of Ukraine, who have suffered for nearly three years under Russian occupation and military intervention. Until Russia and the separatists it supports respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, the crisis will continue. Eastern Ukraine, of course, is not the only part of the country suffering because of Russia’s aggressive actions. The United States continues to condemn and call for an immediate end to the Russian occupation of Crimea. Crimea is a part of Ukraine. Our Crimea- related sanctions will remain in place until Russia returns control of the peninsula to Ukraine. The basic principle of the United Nations is that States should live side by side in peace. There is a clear path to restoring peace in eastern Ukraine — the full and immediate implementation of the Minsk agreements, which the United States continues to support. For the people in eastern Ukraine, the stakes are high. With each passing day, more people are at risk of freezing to death or dying from a mortar blast. The United States calls on Russia and the combined Russian-backed separatist forces to fulfil their commitments in the Minsk agreements and fully restore and respect the ceasefire. The Minsk agreements require the disengagement of forces and the withdrawal of heavy weapons from both sides of the contact line. That is the formula for a sustainable ceasefire. Pulling back forces and taking heavy weapons out of the area will save lives. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission must also be granted full, unfettered access. The presence of OSCE monitors can help calm tensions. Cooperation on this issue is possible. Earlier this week, both Russia and Ukraine supported this Council’s unanimous call (SC/12700) to return to a ceasefire. It was the first time in years that the Council was able to come together on Ukraine. The parties on the ground should heed that signal and hold their fire. The United States expects that those who can influence the groups that are fighting — in particular Russia — will do everything possible to support an end to the escalation of violence. ",,,,,,,,,,,"I thank Mr. O’Brien for his briefing.I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Ukraine.I thank the briefers for the updated information they provided on the attack on the town of Avdiivka, in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, by the Russian occupying forces and their proxies, which led to a humanitarian emergency in the area.Ukraine continues to be fully committed to implementing the Minsk agreements in their entirety. The President of Ukraine has stressed on many occasions that there is no military solution in the Donbas. The Ukrainian Government is sharply focused on peaceful and diplomatic means in that regard. Ukrainian forces continue to respect the ceasefire. They have strict orders to open a fire only in response to the attacks and assault actions of Russia-backed militants.On the contrary, Russia, as the party to the conflict in Donbas, and its proxies have blatantly violated the Minsk agreements from the very beginning. They have continued their attacks and occupied several Ukrainian towns and localities. As of now, Russian proxies occupy about 1,700 square kilometres, going far beyond the contact line agreed in Minsk on 19 September 2014.Before the crisis in Avdiivka, there was the battle for Debaltseve two years ago, which was captured by Russian forces immediately after the Minsk summit on 12 February 2015, contrary to decisions taken by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France.In the early hours of Sunday, 29 January, the Russian army and its proxies began massive artillery attacks on Avdiivka and its suburbs from residential areas in Donetsk and Yasynuvata, which are under the control of the Russia-led terrorists, and sent assault units to storm positions of the Ukrainian armed forces. The Russian forces used Grad multiple-rocket launch systems, tanks, 152-millimetre and 122-millimetre artillery, and 120-millimetre and 82-millimetre mortars. All those weapons are forbidden under the Minsk agreements. On 29 January alone, the Ukrainian positions were shelled nearly 400 times.The shelling intensified on 30 and 31 January, when civilian infrastructure sites were also targeted. As a result, the Donetsk water filtration plant and the Avdiivka coke plant, which provides heat for Avdiivka, are now without electricity. The city is left without water, electricity or heat. The current temperature in Avdiivka is -18°C. Without central heat, civilians will not survive. Sixteen thousand people ended up without water, electricity or heat, including 2,000 children. Just imagine: 2,000 children without heat at -18°C. Ukrainian emergency services prepared to evacuate people from Avdiivka.Numerous attempts by the Ukrainian services to repair damaged infrastructure were consistently blocked until 1 February by the Russia-led terrorists, who continued shelling, and by the Russian part of the Joint Centre for Control and Coordination (JCCC), which were unreasonably delayed in providing security guarantees necessary to reach the destroyed objects.According to information that we just received 15 minutes before the start of this briefing, the separatist forces resumed the shelling of residential areas of Avdiivka using high-calibre artillery systems. Several residential buildings were hit and there are several fires around the town. One of the shells exploded close to a temporary heating station that had been set up by the Ukrainian authorities to provide Avdiivka residents with warmth in these freezing temperatures.Destroying critical infrastructure and thus creating a humanitarian disaster is a terrorist tactic aimed primarily at civilians. This tactic obliterates the Russian propaganda myth of so-called peaceful miners who fight the authorities with their own shotguns. Locals would never do this to their neighbours, but those who have come to Ukrainian soil as aggressors to destroy Ukrainian statehood do not hesitate to damage factories, houses and powerlines. This tactic is not new for the Russian forces.The aforementioned actions by Russia may qualify as a war crime. Ukraine will add evidence related to the recent escalation and indiscriminate attacks on civilian infrastructure to our claim against Russia on terrorism to the International Court of Justice. This is a first but very important step in bringing Russia to justice for its mounting violations of the United Nations Charter and international law.The Ukrainian Government announced the emergency situation in Avdiivka. We have managed to sustain the functioning of the heating system at a minimum level and to avoid the rapid degradation of the situation into a real humanitarian disaster. Eleven warming centres have been set up, scores of field kitchens have been deployed, and kindergartens and hospitals are functioning in emergency mode. Additional police units have been deployed to protect civil order and to help provide a timely response to the emergency.The events of recent days have become a test for monitoring and coordination mechanisms in Donbas. Since the outbreak of hostilities, Ukraine has repeatedly, literally hundreds of times, requested Russian representatives at the JCCC to use their influence to stop the hostilities. Of the 230 requests made during the period from 29 January to 1 February to stop the hostilities in the area around Avdiivka, all but two were ignored. On 31 January, Ukraine called for an urgent video-teleconference meeting of the Trilateral Contact Group (TCG) to defuse tensions. Once again, the Russian side and their proxies in Donbas did not show up, claiming that this was not the right time. Seriously? Not the right time?Despite calls from all corners for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weaponry, the militants continue shelling day and night. On 1 February, despite the appeal of the Trilateral Contact Group for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire in the region of Avdiivka, Russian militants did not stop shooting, and even shot at the repair team that was trying to fix the damaged power line. They shelled residential buildings and last night shelled one of the roads designated for the evacuation of civilians. This is nothing less than a war crime.I have a picture here that I would ask the Council to look at. This is an apartment building in Avdiivka; at least 1,500 people lived there. It was shelled by terrorists, and the inhabitants rushed out into the freezing cold; it was -20°C outside. This is beyond evil. The perpetrators, those who pulled the trigger and those who gave the orders, should face justice, and they will.It has to be mentioned that when the content of the aforementioned appeal was being discussed in the Trilateral Contact Group, the Russian side was against the formulations regarding repair work on the energy and power-supply infrastructure. This is additional clear evidence of the Kremlin’s intention to create a humanitarian catastrophe in Avdiivka, as was done, by the way, by the Russian army in Aleppo not so long ago.Two Ukrainian soldiers have died and 14 have been wounded over the past 24 hours. Altogether, 20 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and 134 wounded by Russian hybrid forces and Russia-backed militants since the beginning of the year. We call on the Russian Federation to abide by the ceasefire and to ensure the necessary secure conditions for the repair work.The attacks on and near Avdiivka in recent days as well as the continuing Russian aggression underscore two important trends. First, Russia and its proxies in Donbas continue to block and undermine the peaceful process by pursuing their political objectives through the indiscriminate use of force. There can be no illusion about the Russian role in the implementation of the Minsk agreements. Every bit of progress made in the TCG or on the contact line is flagrantly destroyed by another assault by Russia-led terrorists.Secondly, the existing mechanisms created to avoid further destabilization and to move forward with the implementation of the Minsk agreements are not efficient enough to fulfil their mandate. Despite the urgency of the situation, the TCG met only three days after the outbreak of hostilities, and the JCCC appears to be an ineffective tool in a crisis situation — all of this due to Russian non-cooperation. Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission observers still face serious restrictions on their freedom of movement on the territories temporary controlled by Russia-backed militants. They lack 24/7 monitoring capabilities and the relevant technical means.The events around Avdiivka have created an obstacle to Russia’s aspiration to resolve the conflict in Donbas by military means. Yes, the Ukrainian army proved its strength and ability to repeal a Russian offensive. However, Ukraine is paying a dramatically high price, losing its best sons and daughters to this war.We care about our people. The death of every single soldier or civilian is yet another scar on the soul of Ukraine. I ask the Council to look at this picture; it shows a 26-year-old officer, Andriy Kyzylo, who was killed on 29 February near Avdiivvka. Look at his eyes, Mr. Ambassador; it is your weapons and your compatriots who killed him.(spoke in Russian)You killed him. (spoke in English)Our people get down on their knees to treat their fallen defenders. Russian invaders are buried in unmarked graves. We are seeking peace and are doing our utmost and taking every step to bring peace back to Ukraine. Therefore, we do not advocate a military solution and believe that the available political means should be used. The armed confrontation could be easily ended. The Russian Federation should stop arming militants and sending its mercenaries and military personnel to Ukraine.Does anyone seriously think that rockets and artillery shells grow on trees in Donbas? We are talking about tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition. Since November, we and international observers have noted an increased supply of ammunition and armour to militants from the Russian Federation. Now we are seeing the consequences.What is clear is that an international security presence on the ground needs to be enhanced so as to prevent such provocations in future and thus contribute to the implementation of the Minsk agreements and, ultimately, to a peaceful resolution. We once again urge the Russian Federation to exercise its responsibility to implement the Minsk commitments, specifically their security and humanitarian provisions. We urge Russia to halt its support for terrorists and to stop building hybrid terrorist armies in eastern Ukraine as well as its military buildup along Ukraine’s eastern borders.Moreover, we call on the Russian Federation not to expand the framework of the escalation. Yesterday Russian military forces shelled and damaged an Antonov An-26 Ukrainian aircraft while it was conducting a flight over the Odessa gas-deposit region in the Black Sea, in Ukraine’s exclusive maritime zone. This time only a lucky coincidence saved the crew from the Russian shelling. God only knows what will happen next time.There is a rather simple remedy that would stop this Russian aggression against my country and prevent further civilian suffering. What the international community needs to do is to step up the pressure on the aggressor and urge the Russian Federation to get out of Ukraine.I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.I shall now give the floor to those members of the Council who wish to make statements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Plurinational State of Bolivia takes note of what we have heard in the briefings by Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs; Ambassador Ertuğrul Apakan, Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine; and Mr. Stephen O’Brien, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.We express our concern about the resurgence of tension in Donbas. We deplore in particular the non-compliance with the ban on the use of heavy artillery, given the urgent need to maintain the ceasefire. In that regard, we approve of the Council’s press statement SC/12700, of 31 January, which condemns the use of weapons banned by the Minsk agreements and calls for full compliance with resolution 2202 (2015). Bolivia calls upon the parties to respect the provisions of the Minsk agreements, as endorsed by resolution 2202 (2015), which is essential to strengthen the efforts the parties must make in the search for a peaceful and political solution to the crisis.We are particularly concerned about the impact of the crisis on the civilian population. We therefore urge the parties to strictly adhere to their obligations in terms of protecting civilians, including the need to guarantee access to humanitarian assistance and basic medical services. With the support of the international community, full compliance with the Minsk agreements and the joint efforts of the Security Council it should be possible in the short term to avoid a military escalation and to reach a peaceful solution to this crisis with a view to preventive diplomacy, which the Secretary-General has called for. Every possible effort must be made to achieve lasting peace, which in the long term will be beneficial not only for the parties but also for the region and the entire world. We also call for the parties to not step up the rhetoric, for we do not think it will contribute to a political solution to this very difficult situation.","I wish to thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman and Under-Secretary-General Stephen O’Brien, as well as the Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission, Ambassador Apakan, for their briefings on the most recent developments in eastern Ukraine.The deteriorating security situation in the region and the use of weapons prohibited by the Minsk agreements is a matter of concern. We also note the consequences of the most recent violence in terms of civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure. The humanitarian situation requires an urgent response.We believe there is a need to do everything possible to de-escalate the situation. In that regard, we fully support the call made by the Security Council two days ago (SC/12700) for an immediate regurn to a ceasefire regime. No doubt, a resolution of the situation in the eastern region of Ukraine can be achieved only through a peaceful settlement. That is why it is absolutely imperative that the parties remain fully committed to the implementation of the Minsk agreements and strictly adhere to resolution 2202 (2015), which endorsed the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements.","Kazakhstan is gravely concerned about the dangerously deteriorating situation in eastern Ukraine and its severe impact on the local civilian population, which results in death and injuries and many humanitarian problems. We extend our sincere and deep condolences following the civilian casualties, which we consider to be unacceptable. We express our appreciation to Under-Secretaries-General Feltman and O’Brien and to Ambassador Apakan for their updates, as well as their efforts to resolve the crisis.My delegation would like to refer to some key points. We are very much interested in the stability of Ukraine, taking into account all that has transpired and the current situation on the ground. We express sincere concerns about the fate of young people, women and all vulnerable groups in the crisis zone, as well as the effect on future generations. Last March, my President, who contributed to the launch of the Normandy format, mentioned at the Nuclear Security Summit that was held in Washington, D.C., that bringing an end to the conflict in eastern Ukraine should be of utmost common priority. Conflicts should be resolved through negotiations.Kazakhstan is firmly convinced that there is no alternative to resolving the crisis in Ukraine other than through peaceful means based on the observance by all participants of their obligations, in accordance with the norms and values of international law and key principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We therefore call for strict compliance with resolution 2202 (2015), on the Minsk agreements.Kazakhstan fully endorses the activities of the Trilateral Contact Group and its working groups on implementing confidence-building measures in the four areas they cover. We welcome the results of the Contact Group meeting held in Minsk on 1 February. We also believe that any further escalation of tensions should be prevented in order to avoid a worsening of the situation. Any aggravation of the current circumstances could have unpredictable consequences both regionally and globally. We call upon the parties to withdraw their heavy weapons from the contact line. We stand ready to assist the population, support international mediation efforts and facilitate the negotiation process among all the parties and their leaders, with a view to resolving this situation as soon as possible.Kazakhstan continues to provide both bilateral and multilateral aid. All parties must follow their obligations to provide free access to humanitarian assistance in the conflict zone. We believe that the full-fledged normalization of the country’s situation can be achieved only with the economic recovery of Ukraine, which should be our primary and requisite consideration. We therefore call for economic confidence-building measures to be established. Kazakhstan intends to work in a balanced and unbiased manner, on an equal basis, with all Security Council members to promote compromise and consensus in order to help achieve an early solution to the crisis, keeping in mind the paramount importance of maintaining and strengthening peace and security. We call upon all parties to demonstrate wisdom, responsibility and political will to ensure an immediate return to a ceasefire regime.",,"Let me start by thanking Under-Secretary-General Feltman, Ambassador Apakan and Under-Secretary-General O’Brien for their very useful briefings.As today’s briefings have reminded us, the conflict in Donbas has now been ongoing for almost three years. Each day that it continues to simmer without a solution results in more deaths and injuries, as well as fear and uncertainty for civilians. The humanitarian fallout of the current deterioration in the region is particularly alarming. Access to basic needs, including water, electricity and heating, has been interrupted. Sixteen thousand people are acutely affected, with reports of 2,000 children in need of assistance in Avdiivka.We call on all parties to ensure that civilians are protected in line with international humanitarian law. Humanitarian actors must have access to the entirety of the Ukranian territory, including the zones outside the control of the Ukranian Government. The recent escalation in violence is a clear breach of the first point of the Minsk agreements, which call for an immediate and full ceasefire. A cessation of hostilities is essential for security, which, in turn, is a basic prerequisite for finding a sustainable political solution to the conflict. In that regard, we fully support the efforts of the Organizaion for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the difficult work of its Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine. Safe, full and unhindered access for its monitors must be guaranteed.As a small country committed to a rules-based international order, Sweden relies upon strict adherence to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and respect for international law. Violation of those core principles and commitments poses a threat to the European security order, and are therefore a fundamental concern for all of us.Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity must be fully respected, as underlined by all of us in the Security Council press statement of 31 January (SC/12700). Let us not lose sight of who is the aggressor and who is the victim in this conflict. We highlight Russia’s particular responsibility in that regard, and stress that Russia can bring its influence to bear to end the violence, should it wish to do so. In that connection, we should not forget Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and Sebastopol, in clear violation of international law, including the rules and principles of the United Nations Charter.In line with consistent appeals from the European Union, Sweden calls for an immediate and lasting ceasefire. We reiterate our call for the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. Sanctions against Russia must remain in place until the Minsk agreements are fully implemented. We commend and support the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format. Finally, we call for the rules and principles of international law, including international humanitarian law, to be fully respected.","I would like to join those who have spoken before me in thanking you, Mr. President, as well as Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Mr. Ertuğrul Apakan and Mr. Stephen O’Brien for their briefings to the Security Council on the worsening of the situation in the Donbas region.Egypt expresses its serious concern about the continuation of hostilities in eastern Ukraine, and especially with regard to the supplies of electricity, water and heat, which have been cut off and which affect a great number of civilians in very difficult weather conditions in Ukraine. Egypt calls upon all the parties to respect an immediate cessation of hostilities and to fully implement the ceasefire and prevent any provocation that could create further stress.Furthermore, we must guarantee full access for humanitarian assistance to the entire region affected by the conflict with a view to improving the living conditions of the citizens, above all in the light of the worsening of the humanitarian situation in the region. In that context, Egypt welcomes the agreement expressed by the Council on press statement SC/12700, which was issued on 31 January.Egypt believes that we should seek a peaceful solution to the conflict in keeping with international commitments. We support the Minsk agreements and believe that they are the appropriate framework for dealing with this crisis, which must be resolved in the context of the region, through mediation efforts among the stakeholders and with respect and appreciation for both parties to the conflict and the entire international community. That is essential if we are to reach the ultimate goal of a political solution to the crisis in Ukraine and to achieve peace and stability in the country and a lasting settlement of the conflict in the region.Egypt also urges full compliance with resolution 2202 (2015) and calls on all the parties involved to implement the Minsk agreements’ package of measures and procedures, particularly observance of the ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons, the institution of essential constitutional reforms and the holding of elections in the Donbas region. Those should be accompanied by a settlement of the military crisis brought on by the conflict in coordination with all the parties, without exception.Egypt reaffirms its confidence in the various formats for peaceful negotiations between the two parties. We urge those parties to redouble their efforts to reach a peaceful settlement of the crisis that can fulfil the people’s aspirations within a framework of international legitimacy, to show restraint and to avoid any military escalation. We reiterate our firm support for all efforts designed to achieve a political solution to the crisis, including those in the Normandy format.","At the outset, I would like to thank Under-Secretaries-General Feltman and O’Brien and Ambassador Apakan for their detailed briefings. What we heard from them has reinforced our deep concerns about the escalation of tensions in Donbas over the past few days. That is why we urge all the parties involved to immediately end the intense fighting that erupted around Avdiivka, which involved the use of heavy weapons proscribed by the Minsk agreements and inflicted suffering on the civilian population. We urge them to agree on concrete and immediate steps to reverse the deterioration of the security situation. That includes a return to the ceasefire without delay, to which they have repeatedly committed, as well as to proceed with disengagement in the areas specifically identified in September and to withdraw heavy weaponry in line with the provisions of the Minsk agreements.Secondly, we are seriously concerned about the dire humanitarian situation in the area. In the current harsh winter conditions, with freezing temperatures, thousands of lives are at risk on both sides of the contact line because of the destruction of the local power and water filtration plants. Every action required to restore full access to water, electricity and heating should be put in place without delay to prevent further suffering. We therefore call upon all the parties to allow the urgent repair of critical infrastructure and to grant safe, full, unrestricted access to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission and to humanitarian organizations. The protection of the civilian population must remain the highest priority for all sides. In that regard, my country promptly responded to the humanitarian call with a contribution of €1 million to the World Food Programme and UNICEF programmes on food security and mine-risk education in conflict-afflicted areas.Thirdly, the blatant violation of the ceasefire we are witnessing is not acceptable. The latest developments represent a serious violation of the Minsk agreements. We firmly believe that their implementation is the only path to a political solution to the crisis. In that regard, Italy reiterates its full support of the role played by the Normandy group and the OSCE in facilitating dialogue. We deem it to be necessary to relaunch negotiations without delay and expect a constructive commitment with tangible results to be made with the Trilateral Contact Group. I would like to take this opportunity to recall Italy’s well-known position in support of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.Let me conclude by emphasizing that dialogue and political will must prevail over a military solution. All parties are encouraged to fully honour their commitments in order to achieve an inclusive and sustainable solution to the crisis in Ukraine.","As this is the first time that I take the floor, Sir, since your country’s assumption of the presidency of the Security Council, I would like to warmly congratulate you and to wish you every success. Rest assured of the full support of the Senegalese delegation. I would also like to commend the skill, efficiency and the transparent manner in which the Swedish delegation guided the work of the Council last month.I should like to thank you, Mr. President, for convening today’s briefing with Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman, Ambassador Apakan and Under-Secretary-General Stephen O’Brien, whose updates are key to our discussions.Two years after the signing of the Minsk agreement and the adoption of resolution 2202 (2015) by the Security Council, by which the former was endorsed, the situation in eastern Ukraine is still tense and has suddenly worsened now that armed clashes have resumed. The resurgence in hostilities has resulted in a heavy death toll, left many wounded and exacerbated the region’s dire humanitarian situation. As others have mentioned, the fighting has disrupted electricity, water and heating for thousands, at this time of year when temperatures drop to as low as -20ºC during the night. This alarming picture leads me to urge the protagonists to think about the civilians and immediately cease hostilities, respect the ceasefire and withdraw heavy weapons.I would like to commend the reiterated call by the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine, which met yesterday in an emergency meeting, for an immediate cessation of hostilities. The withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front lines and access for the observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and for humanitarian assistance to affected areas are all crucial.In conclusion, I want to call for an intensification of diplomatic efforts, in particular through the Normandy format, by which France and Germany seek to support Russia and Ukraine in fully implementing the Minsk agreements for the good of the civilian population.","Uruguay is grateful for the detailed briefings by Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman and Under-Secretary-General Stephen O’Brien, as well as by Ambassador Ertuğrul Apakan.Uruguay continues to follow with great concern the recent developments in Avdiivka and the recent violations of the ceasefire. Uruguay thinks it is crucial to step up efforts and dialogue to ensure the effective implementation of the Minsk agreements, as they constitute the right way to achieve a political and peaceful solution to this conflict. Along those lines, Uruguay calls on the parties to ensure the effective protection of human rights of the residents of all regions, in particular of the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk.At the same time, it is also crucial for the parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law in all circumstances. This is critical to addressing the situation of internally displaced persons and people requiring humanitarian assistance, in particular in terms of protection and given the current weather conditions, the continuous supply of water, food, energy and heat, emergency shelter and other critical services in temperatures that drop to -20ºCUruguay recognizes the important work being carried out by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine and believes that it is vital for the Mission to be allowed access to all conflict areas in order to end to fulfil its mandate. We urge a resumption of the spirit with which the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 2202 (2015). The parties must comply with their obligatioons in that regard.In conclusion, Uruguay hopes that the challenges in implementing the Minsk agreements can be overcome and that the disputes can be settled exclusively through peaceful means, dialogue between the parties and with full respect for international law and democratic values.","I thank the briefers for providing us with a vivid update on the situation on the ground. Japan is deeply concerned about the situation in eastern Ukraine and its severe impact on the local civilian population. We are disappointed that, as we have just heard, the ceasefire is not being observed on the ground, even as we speak.Japan strongly calls for an immediate return to the ceasefire regime, as expressed in the Security Council press statement (SC/12700) issued on 31 January. Japan takes note of the statement of the Trilateral Contact Group yesterday calling for an immediate ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weaponry from the contact line and the provision of unhindered humanitarian access to the affected population. The full and prompt implementation of those measures is critical in order to alleviate the suffering of the population and to prevent a further escalation of the situation. Japan calls for all the parties to act swiftly and in good faith.Japan strongly believes that the situation in Ukraine can be solved only by diplomatic means and in full respect for international law, especially the legal obligation to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. The full implementation of the Minsk agreements is the only way forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S/PV.7683,28/04/2016,Deterioration of the situation in Donbas due to the killings of several soldiers and Civilians as well as the discussion of the situation with the Crimean Tatars.,"In accordance with rule 39 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite the following briefers to participate in this meeting: Mr. Tayé-Brook Zerihoun, Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs; Ambassador Ertuğrul Apakan, Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine; and Ambassador Martin Sajdik, Special Representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Chairperson-in-Office in Ukraine and in the Trilateral Contact Group. On behalf of the Council, I welcome Ambassadors Apakan and Sajdik, who are joining today’s meeting via video-teleconference from Kiev. The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. Ukraine through dialogue and consultation. Furthermore, that solution should address the underlying causes of the issue and should fully accommodate the legitimate rights, interests and aspirations of all regions and communities in Ukraine. It also must give equal importance to addressing all warranted concerns so as to achieve a balance of all interests. China calls on all the parties concerned to exercise restraint and to work relentlessly towards a political settlement and the realization of peace, stability and development in Ukraine in order to promote both intercommunal harmony, as well as the peaceful coexistence of Ukraine and other countries. The international community should continue to support all diplomatic efforts towards seeking a political solution. Council discussions should contribute to the easing of tensions on the ground and the proper resolution of the question of Ukraine. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. I give the floor to Ambassador Apakan to respond to comments and questions raised. I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of China. I thank the Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Tayé-Brook Zerihoun, as well as Ambassadors Apakan and Sajdik for their respective briefings. China has been following the situation in eastern Ukraine closely, and is concerned about the recurring hostilities. We have taken note that the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group recently held multiple consultations on the implementation of the Minsk agreement. We have also noted that the ceasefire and other issues were discussed at the meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs in the Normandy format. Last year, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 2202 (2015), endorsing the Minsk agreement and demonstrating the Council’s firm support for a political solution to the question of Ukraine. All parties must faithfully enforce the cessation of hostilities and violence and implement the Minsk agreement. They must also remain committed to seeking a comprehensive, lasting, balanced and long-term solution to the question of The Russian Federation has circulated the draft of a press statement. Considering the situation in the Council, I propose that after the meeting we continue to discuss the text among relevant members. If I hear no objection, it is so decided. ","I would like to thank the Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, the Special Representative in Ukraine of the Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Chief Monitor of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine for their briefings. It is important that they were all able to speak today in order to give the Security Council a complete picture of the developments in the situation on the ground on all fronts — political, security, humanitarian and human rights. For France, a settlement of the crisis in eastern Ukraine remains more vital than ever. Together with Germany, we have continued to work uninterruptedly on mediation within the Normandy format with the aim of achieving a full settlement to the crisis between Ukraine and Russia in accordance with the framework outlined in the Minsk agreements. Our goal continues to be to ensure the restoration of Ukraine’s control over all of its internationally recognized territory. That also requires the re-establishment of its authority over Crimea. On that point, our position is consistent with international law and will not change. Today, we are very concerned about the deteriorating situation on the ground. The increased pace of violations of the ceasefire, which have been observed over several weeks, is accompanied by a human toll that continues to increase, both among the armed fighters and the civilian population. Since the beginning of April, regrettably, there have been more than 20 deaths and 130 wounded in the Donbas area. That ongoing low-intensity conflict, marked by regular clashes in several localities, is unacceptable. It threatens to undermine the main progress that we had achieved since August, which was the end of large-scale fighting and a decrease in the number of victims. It undermines the credibility of efforts towards ensuring a negotiated settlement. We must therefore do everything to put an end to it. Otherwise, there is a serious risk that we could be heading towards a worsening of the conflict, which would be detrimental to all parties, not just to Ukraine. As to the substance, the most recent events on the ground serve to further substantiate our conclusion that the Minsk agreements are the sole valid terms of reference for a peaceful, long-term settlement. There is no other solution. We regret, therefore, the fragmentary implementation of those agreements, although they constitute an international commitment in which the provisions must be implemented by all parties. That includes effectively respecting the ceasefire, which is the only possible basis for making progress, as well as implementing other measures provided for under the Minsk agreements, in particular for constitutional reform when it comes to decentralization and a special electoral law for Donbas. Setting out a political horizon is the best way to ensure that the security situation remains stable. Consolidating the security situation and implementing the political dimension of the Minsk agreements are two topics that are at the basis of any lasting settlement, and cannot therefore be decoupled. Against that disturbing backdrop, we remain more than ever committed, alongside our German partners, to relentlessly pursue our efforts within the Normandy format for the full implementation of the Minsk agreements and to do so without delay. The solutions for progress are well known to us all. In terms of security, it consists of the effective implementation of the mechanisms discussed at the most recent ministerial meeting in the Normandy format, held in Paris on 3 March, for a consolidation of the ceasefire. Besides the withdrawal of heavy weapons, those include strengthening the role of the Joint Centre for Control and Coordination and setting up a mechanism for preventing and resolving incidents. Moreover, the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine should also be able to carry out all of its mandate in an unimpeded and free manner. Threats to its operations and the integrity of its staff are unacceptable. On the political front, the revival of a positive dynamic depends first and foremost on the early adoption of a law on local elections in Donbas, which should be organized within the context of Ukrainian law and according to OSCE standards. Holding those elections can be envisaged only if there is a stable security environment. In our view, that could be maintained by a complementary international presence on the ground under the auspices of the OSCE. We, together with the German presidency of the OSCE, are currently considering that. In humanitarian and human rights terms, it is vital that humanitarian organizations immediately enjoy full access, including safe and unimpeded to all territories under separatist control. Unfortunately, that is still not the case. We also recall the commitment made in Paris on 3 March by the parties for the release by 30 April of all prisoners and illegally detained individuals, which in our view includes the case of Nadiya Savchenko. We are concerned about the frequent allegations of violations of human rights in Crimea, especially against the Tatars and pro-Ukrainian militants. In that regard, the decision of the Russian courts to include the Mejlis, the representative assembly of the Crimean Tatars, on the list of extremist organizations is a flagrant violation of the freedom of expression, association and assembly. It is also important that the neutral observation and objective monitoring work being carried out by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and other human rights organizations can continue unimpeded throughout Ukrainian territory, including in Crimea. We are now at a decisive moment. We hope that the parties will assume their full responsibilities to allow the full implementation of the provisions of the Minsk agreements. The inauguration of a new Ukrainian Government, which has publicly demonstrated its intention to make progress on this point, is an important step. Following that, we, together with our German partners, have multiplied our high-level contacts with all parties to revive a dynamic of trust. Those contacts continue as we speak. We call upon all members of the Council to support those efforts in order to collectively speak with one voice. We hope that, at last, sufficient progress will be made in the coming days in order to permit the convening of a new Normandy format ministerial meeting as soon as possible. Very briefly, I just wanat to say that the draft press statement submitted to us does not seem to cover the entire subject. Therefore, I believe it would need more work before being adopted. ","I would first like to warmly welcome our former colleagues, Mr. Ertuğrul Apakan and Mr. Martin Sajdik, who have undertaken a very difficult task and for whose efforts we are very grateful. And of course I would like to thank Mr. Zerihoun for his briefing. The extremely grave crisis in Ukraine sparked by a coup d’état actively supported from outside the country has now lasted two and a half years. Today, astonishingly, the Permanent Representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom have attempted to tie the start of the crisis to the unification of Crimea with Russia. There is no need to distort the facts. They will not succeed in covering up their blame for the crisis. At the moment Crimea is an island of stability by comparison with Donbas in former Ukraine. For the duration of the crisis in Ukraine, the Security Council has unfortunately been used as a platform for propaganda. The single, although very significant, achievement within the walls of this Chamber was the adoption of resolution 2202 (2015), which approved the package of measures agreed to on 12 February 2015. In adopting that resolution, the Council took on the political responsibility for ensuring the implementation of the package. That is what we must focus on. In our conversations, some of our Western colleagues have admitted that Kyiv is not implementing it. But they also say that, while President Poroshenko personally agreed to the document in Minsk, he does not have sufficient political clout to implement its provisions. We do not accept such explanations. Why did the current Ukrainian leaders seize power through a coup d’état if they were not capable of governing their country? We will be keeping a close watch on the behaviour of the new Ukrainian Government. Mr. Yatsenyuk, who was well known for his bellicose statements, has resigned as Prime Minister. It appears that there are no serious differences between the President and the new Prime Minister and that the latter does intend to implement reforms. But it seems clear that there can be no question of reform succeeding until the bloody conflict is settled and until Ukrainian society comes together and rejects its hostile ideology of extreme nationalism. In that context, we were interested in the Ukrainian delegation’s proposal to hold this Security Council meeting today, particularly since President Poroshenko announced that this was done on his personal initiative. We need to know what the new power structure in Kyiv has to say about its intentions with regard to implementing the Minsk agreements. That is particularly the case in view of the fact that before proposing that initiative, the Kyiv authorities, as usual, consulted Washington, and an assistant to the Secretary of State visited Kyiv. In their bilateral contacts, our American partners have said that they would like to make a constructive contribution to settling the crisis in Ukraine and would even like to join the Normandy format. In practice, however, as we have seen more than once, their interactions with Kyiv have the opposite effect, leading to a radicalization of the Ukrainian authorities’ positions and increasingly aggressive rhetoric on their part. Now this has happened again. With policies such as these, based on a hidden agenda, Washington is undermining trust in its actions, and, as everyone knows, not just in Ukraine but in many other cases. The statement made today by the United States representative is yet another example of that policy. And today’s statement by the representative of Ukraine was deeply disappointing, with a lot of provocative rhetoric and twisting of the facts but zero concrete plans for implementing the Minsk agreements. The tasks facing Kyiv in implementing the package of measures are very clear. The political triad is crucial. First, it involves changing Ukraine’s Constitution and enacting a permanent law on special status for Donbas. Secondly, it has to include the enactment of a law on elections in Donetsk and Luhansk in agreement with their representatives. Thirdly, it has to settle the problem of amnesty in connection with the events that have occurred in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. None of those issues has been resolved. Kyiv continues to refuse to conduct a direct dialogue with the Donbas representatives or to agree with them on the steps to be taken, as provided for in the Minsk agreement. In Kyiv they love to say that it is Russia that is not implementing the package of measures. But it is not we who have to enact all these laws, it is the Verkhovna Rada, and it is not we who have to put them into effect, it is the President of Ukraine. It is perfectly clear that they are simply looking to shift the blame for their problems and make it somebody else’s headache. We are always hearing from Kyiv that the main obstacle to solving the fundamental problems with the settlement is the instability of the ceasefire. However, if we consider it logically and carefully compare the facts of the reports of the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it becomes clear whose interests are served by constantly stirring up the situation on the contact line. It is no accident that the Ukrainian authorities are constantly putting out new ideas either about deploying peacekeeping forces or sending in police with heavy weapons. That is, after all, a very convenient way to proceed: first deliberately fan tensions, and then offer solutions that are unrelated to reality. The sole objective is to play for time and to distract attention from the non-implementation of the Minsk agreements. We are concerned about reports with regard to the worsening situation in the conflict zone in Donbas. The situation began to heat up in December 2015, particularly after Ukrainian armed forces began to occupy towns in the neutral strip. On some occasions, they even crossed the contact line as defined by the Minsk agreements. We view those acts as very dangerous and provocative. Ukrainian forces must pull out of those towns. That assessment is supported by the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission. On 17 April, the representatives of the Ukrainian forces, in discussion with OSCE observers, did not hide their intention to occupy new territories in the south-east. The number of violations of the ceasefire have recently been equal to those in the heated period of the summer of 2015. On some days, there have been up to 4,000 such violations. OSCE statistics indicate that the Ukrainian side is the side that is most responsible for those violations. From 4 to 21 April, the Special Monitoring Mission noted a threefold increase in Ukrainian heavy weapons in the security zone. The most recent report states that only 9 per cent of the declared Ukrainian weapons remain in their storehouses. A significant portion of the missing weapons can be found in the forward positions of the Ukrainian forces. They have continued to use heavy weapons against Donbas towns. As a result, they are destroying houses, and civilians are suffering. Yesterday, the Ukrainian forces, armed with 120- mm weapons, shelled the checkpoint and crossing point of Olenivka. Four civilians were killed, including a pregnant woman. Our British colleague said that he does not care who is shooting, but it matters to us. There was a meeting today of the Permanent Council of the OSCE to consider specific measures to improve the security situation. We need to have a permanent presence of OSCE observers in there, and we must get Kyiv to remove the serious constraints on their movements. We must also monitor the weapon storehouses, and, if necessary, put in surveillance cameras there and in the most dangerous sectors. We must also have “mirror” patrols, not only on all of the territory of the Donbas region, but also in the rear guard of the Ukrainian army. We must step up our efforts to ensure local ceasefires, and we need to have a Joint Control Coordination Centre whose patrols are manned by representatives of the armed forces involved. We must have direct contacts between the various sections. All those measures could seriously reduce the number of incidents. However, it is remains clear, as has been seen in many regional crises throughout the world, that maintaining a ceasefire without resolving the political problems is impossible. Instead of promoting national reconciliation by implementing the Minsk agreements, Ukraine continues its witch hunts and efforts to prepare for war. The latest example of that trend, instead of the needed reforms, is the decision to set up a ministry to deal with “anti-terrorist operations” in the “occupied territories”. Ukraine has persisted in calling the representatives of Donetsk and Luhansk separatists, despite the fact that those representatives signed the Minsk agreements and demonstrated their willingness to continue to live in a Ukrainian State. An economic blockade remains in place on Donbas. All dissidents are being called terrorists and separatists, and they are being persecuted in all kinds of ways. The standard operating procedure for those in power in Kyiv has been torture and abuse of individuals, arbitrary detention and extrajudicial punishment, much of which has been cited by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, but the Western patrons of human rights prefer not to talk about that. The American and British Permanent Representatives have tried again today to slander our humanitarian convoys into Donbas. From the very beginning, we called upon the Ukrainian Administration to organize monitoring at the border, but Kyiv refused. They have also refused permission to international entities to carry out such inspections. Generating cheap propaganda is preferable, it would seem, to relieving the suffering of the people of Ukraine. Today, it is not possible to forget the tragic date, 2 May 2014, when, two years ago, 48 people were burned alive in Odessa and more than 200 were injured. No one has been punished for that crime. The Council of Europe Office in Ukraine has stated that the investigation carried out by the Ukrainian authorities does not meet the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights, in particular the requirements of independence, effectiveness, thoroughness and timeliness. We call upon members of the Security Council not to forget that tragic event. It is important to establish the truth and to bring those responsible to justice. In that context, we can only feel disgust at the recent appointment to the speakership of the Ukrainian Parliament, the Supreme Rada, of the odious person known as the “Commander of the Maidan”, who, according to many witnesses, participated in the provocative shooting by snipers, both in Kyiv during the coup and in Odessa. It is not surprising that, when he assumed that post, he proposed in Parliament that they should remove the paragraph on the special status of Donbas from the draft bill on changing the Constitution. The recent meeting between him and a high-level representative from Washington, D.C., again reminds us of the mechanism behind those bloody events. In conclusion, I should like to again stress that what is extremely important today is to implement the package of measures on the Minsk agreements, as well as the strict, consistent and full implementation of the provisions of those agreements. It is the only way forward for settling the conflict in Donbas and for resolving all related problems. That concludes the main part of my statement. Now, if I may be allowed, I would like to make two brief comments. As the Council is aware, we were not here to discuss the issue of Crimea. That is because that is a domestic affair of the Russian Federation. But since the issue was raised, I would like to comment. Indeed, the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatars was banned by Russia because of their extremist activities. In some countries, after not enough attention was paid to dealing with extremists, we can see what serious consequences that has wrought. We will not repeat that mistake. The reality is that, during recent times, there has been a new wave of movement of members of Crimean Tatars to Russian Crimea. We have seen more then 1,000 requests from Uzbekistan alone, for example, which have been accepted. Kyiv should concern itself not about the Tatars in Crimea but about Donbas, where heavy weaponry and tanks have been attacking the civilian population, their homes, schools and hospitals. The civilian population is also under an economic blockade and their social benefits and pensions have been cut off. Kyiv on a daily basis is jeopardizing the people’s rights to health and to their very lives. We note that, in recent years in Ukraine, they banned the Communist Party and many other parties. They have also suppressed civil society groups and people’s access to the media. In addition, they have seized and destroyed Orthodox churches and monasteries under the Moscow Patriarch. The Parliament has a draft bill aimed at banning the activities of that Church in Ukraine, although 12,000 people are members of that Church. Such a campaign could be compared, say, to efforts in a Catholic country to ban the Catholic Church, for example, because they did not like that Church. Therefore, our Ukrainian colleagues and others who are selective human rights activists should not preach sermons to us. Now another minor comment, if I may. Mr. Sajdik in his statement said something that seemed rather strange to me. He said he requires an answer to the issue of Kyiv’s control over its borders. But the answer to that can be found in paragraphs 9 and 11 of the Minsk agreements’ package of measures, which clearly state that, after elections are held and the new Constitution is adopted, Ukraine will then regain control over its border. There are eight paragraphs that deal with what exactly should figure in the Constitution about the special status of eastern Ukraine, Donbas. The answers are there. We must work in line with the provisions of the agreements and draw up laws in consultation with the representatives of the regions concerned. The Ukrainian authorities do not want to do that, insisting on restoring what they refer to as their territorial sovereignty and control, all of which is a cause for serious concern. I have a further point. A very important fact has been communicated to me. When I spoke about the increased presence of Ukrainian armed forces on the contact line, this is what I said: the most recent report of the Special Monitoring Mission noted that Ukrainian storehouses account for just 9 per cent of the arms stock. Most of the rest of those weapons can be found in front- line positions, which demonstrates the position of Kyiv with regard to a peaceful settlement in the Donbas. First of all, it seems very important to me that Ambassadors Apakan and Sajdik take away from this meeting the impetus to step up the implementation of the package of measures of the February 2015 Minsk agreements. However, I would like to talk about something slightly different. It is not fully clear to us why the Ukrainian leadership initiated today’s meeting. Nothing constructive in terms of internationalmplementing the package of measures has been heard from the Ukrainian side. Now, if it was their intention to exacerbate tensions in order to launch a new military operation, we believe that such a calculation has not been justified. We have heard much here in terms of common sense and good ideas, and we hope that the Ukrainian Government will listen. They must stop the fighting and the shooting and deal with the political settlement in a serious manner. In that regard, we have heard it said that the Minsk Agreements should be implemented; however, in the spirit of transparency, that should be put down on paper. Over 24 hours ago, we drafted a press statement for adoption by the Security Council. Every member of the Security Council should already have the document, but I would like it to be circulated here once more, as I wish to address it. In the 24 hours since the draft was circulated, only one delegation — the Ukrainian delegation — has provided us with feedback. They said that the text was unacceptable, but did not say why. Now, I would like to have all members of the Security Council take a look at the text so that we can adopt it. Although it is very brief, it does contain two very important dimensions of the situation. The most important is, of course, the implementation of the Minsk greements. I will read out the draft press statement. “The members of the Security Council recalled its resolution 2202 (2015), which endorsed the ‘Package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements’, adopted and signed in Minsk on 12 February 2015, and called once again for the full implementation of the package as soon as possible.” I would like to recall that paragraph 1 in the package of measures calls for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire. Much was said about that today, and many expressed concern about the situation in that regard. Such an appeal would be very appropriate at this stage. With regard to the second paragraph, it will soon be the second anniversary of the tragic events in Odessa. As we have said, the investigation called for has not been undertaken, and in Odessa there is much tension in connection with that issue. There are statements that various measures will be taken. The so called volunteer battalions, including Azov battalion and other units which are known for their atrocities in eastern Ukraine, are being brought to the city of Odessa, and we would like the Security Council to take some action, at least, confirm the need to conduct an investigation, which would perhaps calm the situation. Accordingly, we have proposed the following second paragraph in our draft press statement: “The members of the Security Council also recalled the tragic events in Odessa, Ukraine, on 2 May 2014, when dozens of civilians were killed and hundreds were injured. They underlined the need to speed up the investigation, while ensuring its objectivity and impartiality, in order to bring perpetrators of this reprehensible act to justice.” We have drafted the text in such a manner that it would be impossible to protest the elements contained therein. I would therefore call on our Ukrainian colleagues to show some understanding of the current situation, which is expected of them by many people, including Mr. Apakan and Mr. Sajdik, with respect to the realization of the package of measures. How can they have any objection to the text? We fully do not understand, and we would therefore propose, in a spirit of transparency, a vote on this draft text, so that the President of the Security Council could read it to the press at the end of our meeting.  A minor point, but I said accurately in Russian what my British colleague said, namely, that he does not care who did the shooting. But we do care. We continue to believe that those who kill civilians should not be left unpunished. So we care very much who did the shooting. But that is not such a substantive detail. I am more surprised at what our Ukrainian colleague said about the events that took place on 2 May 2014 in Odessa. The more so as he said that Odessa is his native town. An event took place in his native town that shook the whole world. There were many awful events during the crisis — murders and different forms of violence — but that event was a milestone. Forty- eight people were burned to death, as could be seen on television when those who tried to save themselves jumped out of the windows and were shot. Many witnesses, including the television coverage itself, said that the attack was planned, inter alia, by the current speaker of the Verkhovna Rada. With regard to what happened in Odessa, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Ukraine, who was born in Odessa, says that that attack does not require special attention, but, as I have already said, it is possible that an awful tragedy is in the offing and may take place in Odessa on 2 May. He is also indifferent. He wants to see the event in the general context. But our Western colleagues have also only wished to address the general context. Their position is quite characteristic. It is however rather strange for France to do so, as it took part in the elaboration of the package of measures. Throughout this chain of events the only useful thing that we have done, and that we must continue to do in order to settle the conflict, is to implement the package of measures. But some say that we cannot confirm the package of measures. Our Ukrainian colleague said that he can agree on the first paragraph, but our American and British colleagues cannot. They say that they want to play a constructive role, but if we do not refer to the “aggression”, they will not support the document. There is nothing about aggression in the package of measures. We note that the United States likes to use that term — it has one aggression after another with destructive consequences throughout the world. But no aggression is mentioned in the package of measures. They are again just trying to draw attention away from the serious political and diplomatic work. And the United States says that it wants to be constructive and help us. How can we understand that claim? It is not possible to understand that position. It was repeated again just now. The United States is not even prepared to agree with the first paragraph, which mentions the need to ensure the realization of the package of measures as soon as possible. Why? Because no reference to Crimea is made in that paragraph? Well, that is because the package of measures makes no reference to Crimea either. It is very clear, as you said, Mr. President, that there is no consensus here. We see exposed the position of some members of the Security Council, in particular our British and the American colleagues. They ought not to claim that they want to participate in a constructive manner. France and Germany will perhaps take part in a constructive way in the implementation of the package of measures, but the others will still be engaged in their demagoguery and hide their roles in all those matters. Here we have come up against one of the main problems, as a result of which the settlement of the crisis has been delayed in the Ukraine. Maybe we could continue this discussion in an another place. The representative of Ukraine helped me work on that agreement. We believe it is important. However, President Yanukovych gave up too much as a result of that agreement, and it seems that its provisions were weak. That is true, because he was overthrown, but the signatories of that agreement should have insisted on respect for the agreement as signed. Perhaps the representative of Ukraine has his own interpretation, but the problem is that, if that agreement had been respected, then in 2014 Ukraine would have had a new constitution and there would not have been a conflict. But it started shooting and started to use force, and now we have seen what has happened. Throughout this crisis, we have been repeating one word: “dialogue, dialogue, dialogue”. However, Ukraine carried out anti-terrorist operations, there were terrorists, et cetera, and that is what they got. ","I thank the Minister for his remarks. I join others in welcoming Assistant Secretary-General Zerihoun, Ambassador Apakan and Ambassador Sajdik back to the Security Council, and I thank them for their sobering briefings today. As those briefings have told us so clearly, the word ceasefire is losing its meaning in eastern Ukraine. Since the start of 2016, it has been broken thousands of times. Those violations are causing almost daily casualties. Weapons banned under the ceasefire are being put to deadly use on the battlefield. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission personnel, charged with monitoring the ceasefire, are being harassed and threatened, and worse. People are dying, and those in need are going hungry. To illustrate how empty the word ceasefire has become: just yesterday, tragically, four civilians were killed. And in response to those harrowing deaths in Olenivka, all we have seen is just claim and counter- claim, That is not good enough. All sides have an obligation to uphold the ceasefire. They all have a duty to protect civilians, especially the vulnerable. What we need to see is a real, meaningful commitment to the ceasefire by all sides. That is the only way to stop the killings. That is the only way for the Minsk agreements to succeed. A ceasefire is the bedrock for Minsk. Without it, all the other measures will falter. All sides have a role to play, but we should be under no illusions as to where the vast majority of responsibility lies. It falls squarely at the door of the Russian-backed separatists. The Special Monitoring Mission has repeatedly made that clear. It is the separatists who are harassing OSCE monitors. It is separatists who risk escalating the febrile situation. And it is the separatists who are receiving troops, equipment and weapons from their Russian allies. The continued support from the Russian Federation has sustained the instability in eastern Ukraine. Russia’s so-called humanitarian convoys cross the border with no regard for Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity or independence. They do so without any inspection. We therefore call on Russia to prove that they have nothing to hide and allow international access to those convoys. While Russia’s support for the separatists fuelled this crisis, Russia’s influence can also bring about a conclusion to the madness. We call on Russia to use its influence for good, to bring the separatists to heel, so that they respect the ceasefire and withdraw banned weapons, so that they allow unhindered access to the Special Monitoring Mission, and so that international humanitarian agencies can finally access all areas of separatist-held territory. It is almost meaningless to discuss any other aspect of Minsk until that has happened. What we are discussing today — the death, the suffering — these are all the bloody consequence of Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea two years ago. That act of aggression went against every treaty, every international commitment, that Russia has ever made. It went against all the rules and norms of international behaviour in the modern world. Our position on that act of aggression will never waiver: Russia must return Crimea to Ukraine. Until it does, it will continue to face the consequences of its illegal actions. Over the past two years, the human rights situation in Crimea has deteriorated. For minorities and political opponents, life under the de facto authorities is now characterized by arrests, ill treatment, torture and intimidation. The Crimean Tartar community has been particularly affected. The banning of their representative institution this week is just the latest in a series of attacks on their community, their organizations and their way of life. In the light of the evidence found in United Nations and OSCE human rights reporting, it is perhaps unsurprising that Russia has consistently denied access to international human rights organizations, save for the solitary Council of Europe mission in January. One of the recommendations from that mission, which reported back to the Council of Europe Secretary General this month, called on Russia to open up Crimea to international human rights monitoring mechanisms. We repeat that call today. Russia must grant such access to enable a proper assessment of the situation. Let me conclude with this final point. Through its actions in Crimea and through its support to the separatists, Russia has brought chaos to Ukraine. In that chaos, thousands of lives have been lost, including those four civilians only yesterday. No matter who fired the shells that killed those poor people, it is clear that, without Russia’s actions, they would not have been exposed to the horrific violence that claimed their lives. I therefore end by once again calling on Russia to fulfil its commitments under the Minsk agreements and to allow Ukraine to regain control of its sovereign territory. That can happen only if there is a stable ceasefire. I wish to respond to two particular points that the representative of Russia made in connection with our earlier statement. First, he made a reference to our comments on Crimea, which, by the way, according to the United Nations, is categorically not a part of Russia. He said that Crimea was a stable peninsula. I would just repeat the words of my country’s Permanent Representative in that connection: “grant access to enable a proper assessment of the situation”. That is all that we are asking for. Surely, that should be acceptable if Crimea is a stable peninsula. Secondly, there was a gross misrepresentation of my Permanent Representative’s words. Our Russian colleague said that we do not care who fired the shells. What my Permanent Representative said was, “no matter who fired the shells”. As the Russian Permanent Representative, who speaks excellent English, knows, the meaning of that is not the same. We are not trying to express indifference. Far from it, the way we raised that point was intended to reinforce our view that responsibility lies on all sides and that they should all work together to try to deliver a solution. That is what we expect from Russia. If the Russians are serious about finding a solution, no matter what levels of support they are offering to the separatists, they could do much more in order to help the rest of us to understand what is really going on in eastern Ukraine and Crimea. They could do that by agreeing to consider the Ukrainian request for a policing mission as well as how to enlarge and adequately equip the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, particularly along the border. Finally, turning to the draft press statement, I do not believe that it is a constructive and particularly serious effort. As the Russian Permanent Representative knows full well, and as my American colleague has said, the draft statement does not cover the full picture. Support to separatists is not mentioned; Nadiya Savchenko is not mentioned; the investigation into Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 is not mentioned; and Crimea is not mentioned. We will be happy to engage on the draft, but, as my American colleague said, press statements are agreed by consensus. ","I thank the Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Tayé-Broook Zerihoun, Ambassador Apakan and the Special Representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Chairperson-in-Office in Ukraine, Mr. Martin Sajdick, for their informative briefings. I would also like to thank the Ukrainian delegation for calling this essential meeting. We recognize, as I think all members of the Council do, the critically important work that OSCE teams are carrying out in the field, often at significant personal risk — as illustrated by the recent attacks on OSCE monitors. We also note the great work done by United Nations staff — again at significant personnel risk, as evinced by the detention of a United Nations staff member by Russian-backed separatists since 8 April. That staff member should be released immediately and unconditionally. The Security Council has not met to discuss the situation in Ukraine since December 2015 (see S/PV.7576) — a long stretch by recent standards. It would not be unreasonable to interpret the absence of meetings as a sign, perhaps, that the implementation of the Minsk agreements is advancing. Yet, as we all know, and as we have heard starkly today, that is, sadly, not the case. Over the past several months, the conflict has worsened. Violence has increased, and the challenges to implementation of the Minsk agreements have only increased. Before delving into those discouraging developments, it is important to remind ourselves of the root cause of this crisis. What is happening today is the result of Russia’s violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, which began with its occupation of Crimea more than two years ago. That occupation expanded with substantial military on the ground and weapons support for armed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Every negative consequence of the conflict that we see today — every one — can be traced back to that original sin. We must not lose sight of that incontrovertible fact, even as we focus on the issues and the human consequences in the present. Let me begin with the situation in eastern Ukraine, where violence along the line of contact has reached its highest levels since the 1 September 2015 ceasefire was declared. According to the most recent report by the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, from 25 January to 10 April, “the [Mission] recorded 11 consecutive weeks in which the number of recorded ceasefire violations was higher than in any other single week since early September 2015.” On 14 April alone — and this is shocking even by Ukraine standards — the Monitoring Mission recorded more than 4,000 ceasefire violations, some 500 of them on a single day, using heavy weapons that are prohibited under the Minsk agreements. Just yesterday, as others have noted, we were again reminded of the dreadful human toll of this violence, when an explosion killed four civilians and wounded at least eight more along the line of contact. This cycle of escalation must stop. As the fighting has increased, the unarmed international monitors, whose job it is to document ceasefire violations and to try to de-escalate the violence, have found themselves denied access, threatened and, in some instances, even targeted themselves. The climate, as has been noted by OSCE colleagues, is a climate of impunity. On 7 April, a Monitoring Mission vehicle that was driving deep into Russian-backed separatist-controlled territory some 60 kilometres from the line of contact came under small arms fire. The same day, in separatist-controlled Luhansk, another such vehicle was blocked by Russian- backed separatist forces. When a monitor stepped out of the vehicle to negotiate their passage, a Russian-backed separatist cocked his rifle and pointed it directly at the monitor. Those are not isolated incidents. According to OSCE reports, separatists have been responsible for more than 90 per cent of incidents in which access has been restricted or denied during this month. That brings us back to a question we have asked many times before in the Council. When Russia and the separatists it backs have denied impartial monitors and investigators access — from the time of the invasion of Crimea to the inspection of the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 crash site — the question is: what do they have to hide? Why are OSCE monitors so scary that one needs to shoot up their car, cock guns at them and impede their movement? What is Russia hiding? Working to ensure that a comprehensive and sustained ceasefire takes hold along the line of contact, and that OSCE monitors have the full and unfettered access they need to help monitor that ceasefire, is the sina qua non for the political steps set out in the Minsk agreements. Consider the steps of passing an electoral law and holding free and fair local elections under Ukrainian law and in accordance with OSCE standards. That is of critical importance. We all recognize that. Yet, to hold a democratic election, citizens and election monitors need basic security and basic freedom of movement. Candidates must be able to express their opinions and assemble publicly without fear of violence or reprisals. Yet the climate created by the separatists in the parts of eastern Ukraine that they occupy is not a climate that looks anything like that. In addition to de-escalating the fighting and allowing full access for international monitors throughout eastern Ukraine, Russia must engage constructively and support serious efforts to propose an election law for areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblast, as well as support the steps necessary for an adequate security environment for elections in the Donbas region that meet OSCE standards. Actions such as those, as well as the release of all hostages and detained persons, will help pave the way for further implementation of the Minsk agreements, which should ultimately lead to Russia’s withdrawal of all forces and equipment from Ukrainian territory and the restoration of Ukrainian control over its side of the international border. Pulling back forces and abiding by the ceasefire is also crucial to improving the dire humanitarian situation faced by civilians, who are disproportionately bearing the costs of Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, an estimated 3.1 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance as a result of the ongoing conflict. Approximately 1 million of those people live along the line of contact or in separatist-controlled territory. Yet they are receiving only a fraction of the aid they need, in large part because Russian- backed separatists expelled most United Nations and international humanitarian organizations in July 2015, and have not allowed them consistent access since. In a perverse cycle, Russia uses the dire humanitarian situation that it has helped fuel to send its so-called humanitarian convoys across the international border with Ukraine, all the while preventing Ukrainian and international authorities from inspecting those convoys. Once again, if your convoys are filled with food and medicine, why prevent international inspectors from looking inside of them. To that end, we again urge Moscow to honour its commitments in Minsk to ensure that separatists allow the immediate resumption of full humanitarian access. As the Government of Ukraine seeks to address this Russian-manufactured crisis, it should facilitate the safe movement of civilians and commercial cargo across the contact line. It should keep checkpoints into separatist-controlled territories open, unless closing them is essential to ensuring the security of civilians. And it should find ways consistent with security and administrative requirements to ensure that social, economic and educational benefits are provided to internally displaced persons and other populations, such as older persons and persons with disabilities. Let me turn to another part of Ukraine, Crimea. It has been more than two years since Russia held its sham referendum, one, we must recall, where the question posed to voters — those who turned out — was to join or leave Ukraine. Some choice. It has been two years since then, as well, that 100 Member States, including the United States, adopted General Assembly resolution 68/262, which underscores that the referendum has no validity and affirms our shared commitment, as stated in paragraph 1, to “the sovereignty, political independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders”. If you want a picture of the way Russian authorities govern on sovereign Ukrainian territory, just look at Crimea today. On Tuesday of this week, the Russian- controlled Supreme Court in Crimea declared the Mejlis, the self-governing body of the Crimean Tartars, an extremist organization. As a result, virtually all forms of Tartar political expression and organization have effectively been criminalized. No more speaking to the press — that is a crime. No more convening meetings — a crime. No more holding elections — a crime. Of course, the Mejlis will be allowed to keep its bank accounts, although now they may be used only to pay taxes and penalties to occupying authorities. On the day of the ruling, Crimea’s so-called Chief Prosecutor declared, “Today, we build a world in which every Crimean will be safe and joyful”. That is unless one is a Crimean Tartar or another resident who happens to oppose the occupation. Meanwhile, the crackdown on dissent in Crimea continues to deepen, as the few remaining independent journalists and other critical voices are methodically targeted. On 18 April, a high-ranking Russian justice official argued publicly for passing legislation that would treat questioning the legitimacy of sham Crimea referendum as an “extremist activity”, punishable by law. The following day, the homes of at least seven journalists in Crimea were raided by authorities. One of those journalists is now facing up to five years in prison on charges of allegedly “calling for undermining Russian territorial integrity via mass media”. In another words, for reporting that Crimea is part of Ukraine, as all United Nations maps show that it is, one is locked up. How is that possible? In Crimea and eastern Ukraine, as in so much of Russia, telling the truth is now an extremist activity. Go figure. Let me conclude. I began my remarks today by encouraging us all not to lose sight of the root cause of this crisis: Russia’s occupation of Crimea and ongoing arming, training and fighting alongside separatists in eastern Ukraine. Just as the root cause of this crisis has not changed, neither has the solution. As has always been the case, the crisis manufactured by Russia can and must be ended by Russia, by stopping its arming, training and fighting alongside separatists in eastern Ukraine and by ending its illegal occupation of Crimea. The Minks agreements offer the only pathway — one agreed upon by all sides — to de-escalate this conflict, to restore peace to Ukraine and to reaffirm the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that undergird all of our collective security. But to implement them, Russia and the separatists whom it supports must fulfil the very first step of abiding by an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire and grant full access to OSCE monitors. Together with the Normandy format leaders, the United States will continue to press for their full implementation by all parties, just as we will keep sanctions in place for as long as Russia continues to obstruct their implementation. And we will maintain our Crimea sanctions until Russia ends its occupation of the peninsula. Rather than talk about some hidden agenda of the United States, it is our view that the Russian Federation delegation, and all delegations represented on the Security Council, should work together to re-establish the ceasefire, arrive at a peaceful de-escalation of the crisis and work out a peaceful resolution on the ground. We have just received a draft press statement with the Russian Federation’s suggestion that the Security Council should consider that draft statement on the situation in Ukraine. The United States is ready to engage in a discussion with Council members on a draft that reflects our consensus view of the situation in its entirety. Let us recall the situation. I underscore again that the current crisis in Ukraine is the result of Russia’s aggression and violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. ",,,,,,,,,,,"I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for responding to our request to convene today’s meeting. I would also like to congratulate you, Sir, on your successful presidency of the Security Council this month and to thank for your constructive and effective work. My only regret is that this meeting could not be held on Friday so that my Minister could make it to New York from Beijing, which he is currently visiting, to address the Council.I am pleased to take this opportunity to thank the United Nations and its States Members that took part in the General Assembly meeting held a few days ago (see A/70/PV.92) to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the sad day when the Chernobyl disaster occurred. Our prayers go to the families of those who died or who were otherwise affected by the tragedy in Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and far beyond our borders.Two days ago, I was at the Chernobyl station and witnessed the signing by the representative of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and our Ministry of Energy, in the presence of the President of Ukraine, of the additional agreement to permit the international community to gather the resources needed to finalize the Chernobyl project. I am happy to report that the new confinement — the biggest moving structure ever built by humankind — is close to completion. In November, it will start rolling over the station, thereby effectively sealing off the remnants of the reactor and preventing further radioactive contamination. Ukrainians are deeply grateful to all donor nations, the five permanent members of the Security Council, the Group of Seven, the European Union, the EBRD, industry and international organizations for bringing efforts and resources together and striving to turn the page on the biggest technological disaster in our history. This is a great achievement, and we do believe that, by such concerted efforts, we will be able to resolve all outstanding issues, regardless of how impossibly complicated they might seem at the moment.Unfortunately, this is not the only issue that brought me here today. As if the land of Ukraine had not suffered enough already, as Council members know, we have been struggling for more than two years against the aggression of our neighbour and our formerly brotherly nation, the Russian Federation. As we have heard today from the briefers — and I am grateful to the Secretariat, the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine for familiarizing the Council with the state of affairs on the ground — over 30,000 Ukrainians have fallen victim to the hostilities in Donbas, with approximately 10,000 killed and 21,000 wounded. More than 1.7 million Ukrainians have had to leave their homes and have become internally displaced persons. Every day Ukrainian families lose a son, a father, a husband, a brother. Every day Ukrainian men and women are wounded, often becoming physically and psychologically handicapped for the rest of their lives.On 23 April, just the other day, four Ukrainian soldiers were killed and five were wounded as a result of shelling by militants. Last night, we witnessed the tragic deaths of three civilians. There were also seven wounded; they were probably caught in cross-fire. That incident will have to be properly investigated. Ukraine has already invited OSCE monitors to the site.This war is very hybrid in nature, but it is very real in terms of spilled blood. It is claiming victims regardless of their ethnicity or the languages they speak. They are Ukrainians, Russians, Greeks, Germans, Poles, Jews; all of us are the victims.But there is one particular nation whose fate is again at stake — the Crimean Tatars. This indigenous population of the Crimean peninsula is again suffering, as it did 60 years ago, from Moscow’s brutal grip. Then it was Stalin, now it is the new Great Leader. People are disappearing. The only representative body — the Mejlis — was banned by occupation forces under the false pretext — one that has become very widespread — that it was engaged in extremist activity.Incidentally, a couple of days ago, a Russian citizen and resident of Moscow had her time in jail extended for having been so extremist as to have Ukrainian books in her possession. That is a serious crime indeed, given that the detainee is a director of the only official Ukrainian library in Moscow.But back to Crimean Tatars, whose homes are being raided and whose unique culture and language are being endangered once again. Tatar leaders warn that the ban potentially threatens more than 2,000 members of some 250 central and local Mejlis structures, which are traditionally elected by Crimean Tatars. At any time, they can be accused of conducting extremist activity, prosecuted and re-expelled from Crimea. More than 130 criminal trials against Crimean Tatars have been held, and 21 Crimean Tatar representatives have been kidnapped — 9 are still missing and 3 were recently found dead.I am calling today on the Security Council to demand that the Russian Federation restore the rights of the Crimean Tatars, ensure that the sham justice meted out by the Crimean courts and Prosecutor’s Office be halted, abrogate its decision to ban Mejlis, and, in a broader sense, just get off our lands in Crimea and the east of Ukraine.I would like to be absolutely clear: I am humbled by the sheer magnitude of the attention given by the Security Council to the Ukrainian issue. As a matter of fact, we do not want the Russian aggression against Ukraine to be transformed into yet another item on the Council’s agenda where, despite regular debates, we see no tangible progress towards a settlement. Since taking our seat in the Council, the Ukrainian delegation has demonstrated the utmost restraint in bringing up this subject. But as has already been mentioned by the briefers today, the security situation is not improving, and the Minsk agreements are not being implemented. I am here today to provide the international community with the relevant information on the actual state of affairs on the ground and help to create impetus for a genuine political process aimed at finding a sustainable, peaceful solution to the conflict. Ukraine is convinced that it can be settled only on the basis of the Minsk agreements. I would like to emphasize a couple of the most important points.Since all sides, including Russia, committed to the ceasefire, after some ups and downs the situation along the line of contact has recently deteriorated, as we have heard. Only this week, between 19 and 26 April, the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission reported about 500 cases of ceasefire violations by illegal armed groups, indicating that the intensity of fighting was at a level that had not been seen since August 2014, a time when Russian troops massively invaded Ukrainian territory.Russia’s proxies in Donbas are still presenting major obstacles to the ability of the Special Monitoring Mission to access all the areas under their control and to verify the ceasefire and withdrawal of weapons. I would like to remind the Council that full and safe access for the Monitoring Mission throughout Ukraine, including along the Ukrainian-Russian State border, and the creation of a security area along that border, were stipulated in the original Minsk agreement of September 2014, something that our Russian colleagues have tended to forget recently. The Special Monitoring Mission reported that 95 per cent of all the freedom-of-movement incidents during this period were instigated by militants. Specifically, on 7 April, a Monitoring Mission vehicle was hit by bullets near Snizhne and Mission observers were threatened at gunpoint in the village of Smile. On 9 April, a Monitoring Mission patrol came under militant fire in Zhovanka. On 18 April, in the city of Donetsk, militants threatened to fire on OSCE monitors and detain them, and that is the least of the problems. On 25 April Mr. Zakharchenko, the leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, publicly threatened to shoot OSCE observers if a police mission were deployed in certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.We are extremely concerned about the fact that illegal armed groups have continued to shell Ukrainian armed forces’ positions and civilian sites, especially in places located near the agreed areas for demining. Despite such provocations, we are fully committed to completing the demining of all the agreed-on priority areas, and we are grateful to the United Nations demining experts planning to help. On a personal note, I recently saw an 11-year-old boy from the small Ukrainian town of Mariupol, in southern Ukraine, who is currently being treated in a Montreal hospital and taken care of by Canada’s Ukrainian community. He was on a walk with his brother and a couple of friends and picked up a strange object that cost him three limbs. He is not just recovering in hospital, he does not know yet that he now has no younger brother.Another serious matter is the restoration of damaged economic and social infrastructure in order to provide livable conditions for local civilians on both sides of the contact line. The repairs of the damaged facilities, including water pipelines, can be done only after we have ensured that the security situation has genuinely de-escalated and provided personal safety guarantees for the repairer personnel. Along with that, we remain deeply concerned about the continuing exacerbation of the humanitarian situation owing to the unwillingness of the illegal armed groups in Donbas to lift their blockade of the activities of the international humanitarian organizations in the region.After months of negotiations, there are still 120 Ukrainians being held captive in Donbas whom we cannot get out, regardless of the all-for-all formula that appeared to have been agreed on by everybody. Even the International Committee of the Red Cross has not been allowed to visit them, nor has it been permitted to search for some 800 missing persons. Médecins Sans Frontières has been accused of espionage and banned from the region by the Russian proxies, despite the Russian Federation’s promise to put additional pressure on the illegal groups to let that international humanitarian organization into the region. Yesterday, we barely managed to get our Vice-Speaker of Parliament into Minsk; she was leading a working group on humanitarian issues of the Trilateral Contact Group in Minsk but was banned by Russia for five years, a ban that Belarus supported. And this despite the fact that Belarus offered its capital for peace talks. We are carefully collecting the evidence of these crimes, and we will use it later on. One of these collections makes for very bad reading, with a lot of bad pictures, but our delegation will circulate the information.There are no signs of positive change in the difficult security front, either. Russia has organized and deployed in Donbas a 34,000-strong hybrid military force consisting of regular Russian troops as well as foreign and local militants. Russian generals and military officers are providing direct command-and-control of that illegal military entity, which is impressively heavily armed. Specifically, as of now the terrorists have at least 470 tanks, 870 armoured combat vehicles, 450 tube artillery systems and 190 multiple launch rocket systems, operated by so-called disgruntled miners. That is more than most NATO members have in their regular armed forces, and yet it was allegedly acquired in local hardware stores. The last time I checked, one could hardly buy a decent knife in a hardware store, let alone multiple launch rocket systems and jet flamethrowers — which, by the way, are not to be found in the stores of the Ukrainian armed forces.We would greatly appreciate it if the Russian Federation would take the lead and kindly offer to safely store their beloved separatists’ deadly toys on Russian territory, verifiable by the OSCE, thereby removing another stumbling block in the way of a long-awaited peace, with the aim of showing real interest in the Minsk process and bringing a lifting of the sanctions closer. I do not want take up too much of the Council’s precious time, so our Permanent Mission will be happy to provide members with the information I have here, which will be made available later.The Russian proxies are systematically ruining the social and economic infrastructure of Donbas, once Ukraine’s industrial powerhouse. They are dismantling entire factories and taking them to Russia. Vast reserves of coal in Donbas are also being stolen and transported to Russia. Ukraine has lost more than 20 per cent of its gross domestic product as a result of the Russian aggression. And that is on top of the economic war that the Russian Federation has effectively waged on us by blocking our exports as well as the transit of goods to Central Asian States and China. All of this, I should remind the Council, is in contravention of the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, signed in 1994, whereby the signatories promised not to exert economic pressure on Ukraine.We are totally committed to a political settlement. Our experts have been to Minsk more than 30 times in order to clarify how a political resolution can be achieved and how we can rebuild our ruined economy, revive the region and decentralize our political system. I have no time today to discuss those issues, but I would like to touch on one very key point, the elections, which are not only essential to the peace process but are becoming a reality. We have prepared every piece of the necessary legislation and are ready to discuss their modalities, as our leaders agreed on in Minsk.What we need, in order to kick-start the election process, in accordance with OSCE standards and in conformity with Ukrainian law, as agreed to by our leaders, is a better security situation on the ground. Let us be reasonable. If there is no security, nobody will hold or observe the elections. President Poroshenko recently proposed deploying a police mission in Donbas, which we believe would help to ensure a safe and secure environment in Donbas, particularly in the context of local elections. The status and mandate of the mission, and its umbrella and composition, can be discussed later. We are open to negotiations and will continue to call on the international community, including the United Nations and OSCE member States, to engage constructively in putting the initiative into practice.In conclusion, I would again like to draw the Council’s attention to the issue of human rights. At least 11 Ukrainian citizens have become political prisoners in Russia. They include a member of the Ukrainian Parliament and of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Nadiya Savchenko, a Ukrainian film-director and native Crimean-Ukrainian citizens. We approved a sanctions list against individuals who took part in mock trials of Ukrainian political prisoners in Russia, the so-called Savchenko-Sentsov list. We expect that our international partners will join that initiative.The only thing we are interested in is achieving a lasting, just and fair peaceful solution. That will not be an easy task to accomplish, we know, but anything short of it would be unacceptable to the Ukrainian people, whose best sons and daughters already paid the ultimate price in defending their homeland. We are ready to do our part of the job, but I am afraid that the keys to sustainable de-escalation and a subsequent long-lasting settlement reside in Moscow. It is Moscow that has to produce those keys and open the door to a better, peaceful future without death, hatred or sanctions. I sincerely thank all members of the Security Council for giving me a chance to speak today. It has been a very important discussion for Ukraine, and I think that all of us agree, at least, that the Minsk agreements are the only way forward, in their entirety and complexity, starting from the ceasefire and the withdrawal of weapons and foreign troops, inter alia, to the political resolution, the changes in our Constitution and the decentralization of Ukraine. Incidentally, Ukraine has already started the process of decentralization, and the only part that is not decentralized is held by pro-Russian proxies.With regard to the Russian representative’s statement, I am sick and tired, having been in these negotiations for more than two years, of the accusations of a bloody revolt in Ukraine. The statement was full of the usual “Ds”: distract, distort and deny. We have heard it all before. I have made a very serious effort to familiarize myself with all of the public statements on this subject made by the Russian representative up to now. They add up to 84 pages that are worth reading. Most of the elements are well-formulated and resemble the truth, but only if one allows oneself to forget one principal thing: who came into whose land? Who appropriated the land? Who started killing people? Who sent in additional tanks and mercenaries?With regard to the draft press statement proposed by the Russian Federation, there is no issue with regard to the first part, because it represents, as I mentioned earlier, what all of us here believe and what our leaders have confirmed, namely, that we have to support the Normandy format and the Minsk agreements. In connection with the tragic events in Odessa, my native city and not that of the Russian representative, I believe that we have to investigate all of the events there, starting from the Russians’ actions in Crimea and their support and incitement that lead to the killing of people, some of whom were burned alive, in numerous Ukrainian cities, using knives and other means that were provided by the Russians. We therefore do not believe that the draft statement represents an honest attempt on the part of the Russian representative to bring those tragic events to our attention, because Russian media have already reported on the draft statement well before we were given a chance to read it. I will be brief. I will not add to the attempts to impose more truths, half-truths and lies that members of the Council have been subjected to for quite a long time. If we are going into such details, I would like to bring to the Council’s attention, including that of the Russian representative, that when we speak of the so-called Minsk package of measures, we seem to have forgotten about the initial Minsk agreement, which was signed almost half a year ago. Why have we forgotten about it? Because the Russian Federation all the time refers only to the Minsk agreement of 12 February. I must remind the Council that the original Minsk agreement mentions the special security area along the Ukrainian corridor monitored by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. If the Russian Federation is so fearful that the Ukrainian forces will regain control over the territory of Ukraine, I must remind the representative of the Russian Federation that the idea, which was supported by everyone, was that Ukrainian territory should be returned to Ukraine. But before that, the area around the Ukrainian-Russian border should be placed under the monitoring and verification of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, thereby preventing more weapons and more mercenaries from entering our territory, a practice that we have repeatedly brought to the attention of the Council. I promise, Mr. President, that this will be my last statement. The Russian representative was recalling yet another detail of our long and bloody conflict. The so-called agreements of 21 February — which he just cited — were made possible with help of the four parties. But the representative of the Russian Federation has chosen not to remember the fourth party — Russia was at the table. Although three members of the international negotiating team helped Ukraine, the opposition and the President to sign the agreement, the Russian representative was the only party who did not sign the document. Obviously, he was not happy with the agreement between the opposition and then President, Mr. Yanukovych.In that regard, I have to remind the Council that the official medal that was produced by the Russian Federation for the so-called return of Crimea has the dates on it, starting with 20 February, which is the day before that agreement was brought to the attention of the Security Council by the representative of the Russian Federation. Therefore, the Russian Federation started — not just planned, but started — the annexation of Crimea the day before we reached the first agreement and while President Yanukovych was still in power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"At the outset, I would like to thank Mr. Tayé-Brook Zerihoun, Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, as well as Ambassador Apakan and Ambassador Sejdik for their comprehensive briefings to the Security Council on the developments in Ukraine and on the implementation of the Minsk agreements. We would also like to welcome Mr. Vadym Prystaiko, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine.Egypt has always stressed the need to intensify international efforts to reach a lasting political solution to the crisis in Ukraine, a solution that would bring security and stability in Ukraine, according to the Minsk agreements. Egypt believes that those agreements are the best framework for reaching a lasting and sustainable settlement to the conflict raging in the country.Security Council resolution 2202 (2015) calls on all the parties to implement a package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements, especially those related to the commitment to a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons, the adoption of necessary constitutional reforms and the holding of local elections in Donbas. The package also calls for addressing the humanitarian implications of the conflict, in coordination with all the relevant parties without exception.Egypt expresses its deep concern over the meagre progress on those fronts. We urge all parties to comply fully with their commitments under the Minsk agreements. We call on all parties to engage in the dialogue process and to work towards a peaceful solution that meets the aspirations of the people of the region.As the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate in Donbas, Egypt stresses the vital need of ensuring humanitarian access to all affected areas to improve the life of citizens. Egypt calls on all parties to exercise self-restraint and to implement fully the Minks agreements and the ceasefire for the benefit of the peoples of the region. Egypt will continue to support all efforts to reach a political settlement to this crisis. We commend the ongoing efforts at dialogue under the Normandy format and by other international partners to that end.",,"My delegation thanks you, Mr. President, for organizing today’s briefing. I would also like to welcome the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to the Council.The outbreak of the crisis in Ukraine two years ago testifies to the seriousness of the issue of conflict prevention, the Security Council’s responsibility for the maintenance of peace and how urgent it is that we step up its efforts in that regard. That was why my delegation welcomed the meeting the Council held in this Chamber in February (see S/PV.7635) with Mr. Franz-Walter Steinmeier, Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), one of whose priorities, rightly, is the crisis in Ukraine, with the triple goal of renewing dialogue, re-establishing confidence and restoring security.That is why my delegation, which continues to be deeply concerned about the reports of repeated violations of the ceasefire, would like to recall Senegal’s commitment to promoting dialogue and international cooperation as means to help resolve disputes. In that regard, I would like to reaffirm my country’s support for the Minsk agreements, signed in September 2014 and finalized in February 2015, which constitute a solid basis for reaching a sustainable and credible political solution to the situation in eastern Ukraine. It is therefore vital that the parties join their efforts, with the support of the negotiating frameworks already in place, with the aim of fostering a climate conducive to the diplomatic solution that we all want. In that regard, we should support the efforts that have already been made to reduce tensions and promote peace, stability and security, as well as to facilitate dialogue among the authorities, civil society and ethnic and religious groups.We hope that the various initiatives will contribute to stabilizing the ceasefire more effectively, ensuring the withdrawal of heavy weapons and solidifying a national dialogue, in accordance with the Minsk agreements and within the framework of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine. In that context, I would like to emphasize the importance of the extension by the Permanent Council of the OSCE of the mandate of the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine to 31 March 2017. Given the Monitoring Mission’s impact on the de-escalation and withdrawal of weapons, we believe that the OSCE monitors should continue to benefit from free access to the area in order to better fulfil their role and ensure the effective implementation of the Minsk agreements, particularly the ceasefire. Bearing in mind the importance of establishing credible and legitimate institutions in the current situation, it seems equally crucial to make appropriate arrangements for the holding of local elections in accordance with the provisions of the Minsk agreements.I would like to conclude by urging the parties to renew their commitment to dialogue and by assuring them of Senegal’s full support in their efforts to reach a negotiated and sustainable political solution.","At the outset, we would like to thank the delegation of Ukraine for bringing this item to the attention of the Security Council, and also for the presence of Mr. Vadym Prystaiko, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. We would also like to thank Mr. Zerihoun, Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs and Ambassadors Apakan and Sejdik for their briefings.Our country has been following with concern the recent events in eastern Ukraine, as well as the recent ceasefire violations. We regret that, two years after the conflict began, hostilities have again intensified in recent months, and we are concerned by the reports of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine with respect to the presence of heavy weapons, tanks and artillery systems on both sides of the contact line in the security zone in eastern Ukraine. In that regard, we believe it is crucial to increase efforts and step up dialogue in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Minsk agreements. We understand that is the appropriate way to find a political and peaceful solution to the conflict. In that spirit, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 2202 (2015). We urge the parties to comply with their obligations under the agreements and thereby achieve the objective of the ceasefire.Similarly, Uruguay calls upon the parties to ensure the effective protection of human rights of the residents of the entire region, in particular the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk. We believe that it is crucial for the parties to the conflict to respect international law and international humanitarian law in all circumstances. That is essentail in order to address the situation of internally displaced persons and persons who require humanitarian assistance, in particular in terms of protection, continuous supply of water and food, emergency supplies and other critical services. It is also crucial to guarantee access to humanitarian organizations to the affected areas, and also to guarantee the free and safe circulation of civilians through the contact line.Uruguay recognizes the important work done by the Special Monitoring Mission of the OSCE in Ukraine, and we believe that it is essential that the Mission be allowed access to all areas of the conflict zone in order to fulfil its mandate.Lastly, my country hopes that the challenges in implementing the Minsk agreements can be overcome and that existing differences can be settled exclusively through peaceful means, through dialogue among the parties and full respect for international law and democratic values.","I should like to begin by thank the three briefers — Assistant Secretary-General Zerihoun, Ambassador Apakan and my former colleague, Ambassador Martin Sajdik — for their insightful and sobering briefings.Japan is deeply concerned by the current situation in Ukraine. The briefings we have just heard confirm our concern. Ukraine may not make headlines these days, but the situation is far from calm and stable. The number of ceasefire violations in Donetsk and Luhansk has been on an upward trend since January. During the week of 11-17 April, nearly 1,000 rounds of mortar fire were recorded — the highest number this year. In March, 20 Ukrainian soldiers were killed. This was the highest number of casualties since August 2015.We must challenge this deadlock. The answer lies in the Minsk agreements. That document has been agreed to and signed by all the relevant parties. It was also endorsed by resolution 2202 (2015). Japan once again urges all parties to fully and promptly implement the Minsk agreements.It is a matter of concern that the freedom of movement of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission is increasingly restricted. The Special Monitoring Mission has been playing a pivotal role in helping to de-escalate the crisis. Without such restrictions, the Mission could do much more. Japan stresses that the Special Monitoring Mission must be given full and unfettered access throughout the conflict zone, including the entire border region.Japan strongly believes that the conflict in Ukraine can be solved only by diplomatic means and in full respect for international law, especially the legal obligation to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence.In closing, I wish to confirm that Japan, as Chair of the Group of Seven Ukraine Support Group and as one of the largest donors to Ukraine, remains committed to supporting Ukraine’s efforts for reform.","I thank you, Mr. President, for having convened this debate. I also thank, the briefers, my good friends Ambassadors Apakan and Sajdik. I have had the pleasure of working with both of them here at the United Nations, where they both did excellent work. I also wish to thank the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs and Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine for joining us in this debate.Spain believes that the situation in eastern Ukraine continues to be extremely concerning. The information we have just heard from Assistant Secretary-General Zerihoun and Ambassador Apakan only confirm that. Consequently, we want to see the Security Council continue following up accordingly on the development of the conflict in its different aspects and use all tools at its disposal to support the efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Normandy format countries, which Spain supports.Today’s information also serves to confirm that we are once again going through a troubling time. Not only is the ceasefire that was called for six months ago not being respected in a sustained and consistent manner, but in recent weeks violations have increased and the number of victims rises daily. Moreover, the other security aspects covered by the Minsk agreements that the Council endorsed in resolution 2202 (2015) are not being applied.I wish to point out in particular our concern about the lack of progress in connection with demining activities, given the disastrous effect that that has on the civilian population. We are also concerned by the humanitarian situation and what we have heard concerning the human rights situation. In that regard, we have also very carefully read and taken note of the most recent report of the human rights Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.With regard to the political provisions of the agreements, Spain also believes that the main obstacle to moving forward, with respect to them is the lack of stability and minimal security conditions in the Donbas region. The status quo is unsustainable, and maintaining it can lead only to a further worsening of the situation on the ground and, in particular, more suffering on the part of the of the civilian population, which should be a priority in our deliberations when we consider the conflict.We all know that freezing conflicts does not bring us closer but, on the contrary, moves us farther away from a solution, perpetuating over time their harmful effects. Consequently, we need to redouble our efforts in supporting the Minsk process and the work of the Trilateral Contact Group within the framework of the OSCE, so that we can soon see concrete progress. The Minsk agreements are still the only valid framework to seeking a political solution to the conflict, which has gone on for far too long. But it is not enough to simply repeat that time and time again, if they are not accompanied by a real and active commitment with regard to the obligations that they entail.Everyone, including members of the Council, must focus their efforts on their full, immediate and — above all — good-faith implemention of the agreements. By everyone I mean not only the parties who are directly involved, but also especially all of those who have an ability to influence those parties. In that regard, I call once again on Russia in particular, in its dual capacity as member of the Normandy format and as an actor with a great capacity to influence the separatist leaders of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. We condemn the lack of political resolve and commitment that these leaders continue to demonstrate, and in particular the difficulties they repeatedly raise for humanitarian actors, including those of the United Nations. We also condemn the constraints they continue to impose on the full mobility and privileges of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission, with occasional recourse to violence. These actions are unjustifiable and unacceptable and must end.I cannot conclude without recalling once again the content of General Assembly resolution 68/262, which is binding on us all. Spain is firmly convinced that any lasting and sustainable solution must necessarily involve respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine and for the human rights of all its inhabitants, including those of Crimea. We have read the draft press statement from the Russian Federation, and we agree with the representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom. We are ready to work on a text. However, it does not seem now as though there is enough consensus in the Chamber to adopt the draft press statement as it stands. It appears that there might be agreement on the first paragraph, but not on the entire draft press statement. For Spain, at this time, the Security Council should have a constructive attitude. In any circumstances, any statement that we issue should favour a de-escalation, promote goodwill, advance negotiations — while any action taken separately could be counter productive.","I should like to begin by thanking Ukraine for calling for this debate and to welcome the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs to our meeting. I also want to thank Assistant Secretary-General Zerihoun and Ambassadors Apakan and Sajdik for their briefings.In February 2015, the Council endorsed the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements, which laid out a number of agreed steps aimed at ending hostilities, alleviating humanitarian suffering and establishing a path towards resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Yet more than a year later, none of these measures has been implemented fully. Even the first and most basic of the agreed measures — an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire — is routinely violated. Worryingly, these violations have increased in intensity in recent weeks. The second agreed measure — the withdrawal of heavy weapons — has also not been fully implemented. Recent reports of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) highlight the use of artillery, mortars and tanks, all of which were supposed to have been pulled back from the contact line over year ago. The situation is deeply troubling. Given the abundance of arms in the separatist-controlled regions, there is a real risk of further violent escalation. The persistent violence has caused the deaths of thousands of people, with tens of thousands more injured. Essential civilian infrastructure has been damaged and cannot be repaired amidst flying bullets and falling shells. More than 1.5 million people are internally displaced.Beyond the terrible human costs, the failure to stabilize the security situation has also made progressing other aspects of the Minsk agreements much more difficult. We call on the parties to honour their commitments and implement all aspects of the Minsk agreements. This is the best path towards a stable and lasting peace. As a matter of priority, all parties must deliver on their commitment to a genuine ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons, monitored and verified by the OSCE. We reiterate our call on Russia to use its influence over the separatists to ensure that they implement commitments made in Minsk.The OSCE has a critical role to play in verifying implementation. It is therefore of real concern that OSCE monitors continue to face significant constraints on access and movement in areas under separatist control, including along most of the Ukrainian border that remains under separatist control. Again, we urge Russia to use its influence over the separatists to ensure that OSCE monitors can effectively and safely fulfil their responsibilities under the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements. We condemn recent aggressive acts against OSCE monitors in separatist-controlled areas, including being fired upon and threatened at gunpoint. Such actions must be repudiated by all sides.On the political aspects of the Minsk agreements, we need to see faster progress. Reaching agreement on modalities for elections — which are to be held in accordance with relevant OSCE standards, monitored by the OSCE and in a secure, stable environment — is a priority. Discussions in the Trilateral Contact Group and Normandy format need to be approached in good faith and with a determined focus on problem-solving. We hope that practical steps can be agreed in order to break the current impasse.We must not lose sight of the ongoing suffering of the civilians caught up in this conflict and its aftermath. The humanitarian challenges flowing from the crisis in Ukraine continue to affect the lives of millions. Huge numbers of Ukrainians face daily challenges accessing basic necessities, including food and water. All sides need to intensify their efforts to ensure that support reaches civilians in affected areas and those that have been displaced by the violence. Ultimately, however, the lives of civilians will be best protected through full implementation of the Minsk Agreements and the restoration of peace.Lastly, let me reiterate New Zealand’s rejection of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of the Organization.","I join my other colleagues in expressing our appreciation to the briefers for their comprehensive assessments of the latest situation in Ukraine. My delegation acknowledges the presence of the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine at today’s meeting.Over one year after the signing of the Minsk II agreement and its endorsement by the Council via resolution 2202 (2015), we need to examine how much progress had been made in its implementation. Listening to the briefers, it is obvious that much more need to be done.Malaysia is deeply concerned by the daily violations of the ceasefire. The recent escalation in violence in eastern Ukraine and the missing weapons from the storage sites detected by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission are alarming signs, and we hope do not indicate for the direction in which we are heading. While we welcome the progress made to date in implementing the Minsk agreements, such as the exchange of prisoners and on constitutional reform, we wish to see more efforts towards the holding of local elections in Donetsk and Luhansk, in accordance with the laws of Ukraine, the reinstatement of full border control by Ukraine and the withdrawal of all foreign military personnel, mercenaries and military equipment from Ukraine’s territory.We reiterate our call on the parties to cooperate fully with the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine to enable its personnel to carry out their mandate, including by providing full and unhindered access to the OSCE to rebels-held areas in the Donbas region and the requisite information to enable the OSCE to verify the withdrawal of heavy weapons. Any threats to the security and safety of the OSCE personnel and obstructions that prevent them from fulfilling their mandate are unacceptable. The recent capture of a United Nations staff member by the separatists is a cause of great concern, and we urge his immediate and safe release.On the humanitarian situation, we remind the parties to honour their obligations under international law and international humanitarian law, particularly on the protection of civilians. Malaysia urges all parties to allow safe and unrestricted humanitarian access to those in need. We reiterate our position that humanitarian assistance must be carried out, in accordance with international law, international humanitarian law and respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.Malaysia reaffirms its commitment to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We reiterate the need for a peaceful political solution to the conflict, based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. We commend the hard work of the OSCE and the Trilateral Contact Group in Ukraine, and we urge the relevant parties to intensify cooperation through those frameworks in good faith.In conclusion, we urgently need to break the current deadlock and to halt the downward spiral in implementing the Minsk agreements. Every effort must be made to uphold and stabilize the ceasefire and build trust through confidence-building measures. Malaysia therefore urges both sides to renew their commitment, engage in good faith and redouble their efforts to fully implement the provisions of the Minsk agreements.","We would like to welcome the presence of the Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Tayé-Brook Zerihoun, and Ambassadors Apakan and Sajdik.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has on many occasions expressed its strict adherence to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, wherein the peaceful settlement of disputes and direct dialogue between the parties are an essential component. That is why we reiterate our conviction that the full implementation of resolution 2202 (2015), in support of the decision by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany on 12 February 2015 in Minsk, is the fundamental basis for the consolidation of efforts to encourage the parties to work together towards a political and peaceful solution to the Ukrainian crisis. In that context, our country considers the ongoing work of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in support of the effective implementation of the Minsk agreements to be a positive step forward and has been following the recent violent events in the Donbas region with great attention.On 5 April 2016, the representatives of the countries of the Minsk Group of the OSCE condemned the resurgence of violence and further stated that “there is no military solution to the conflict”. Also, the joint statement after the ministerial meeting of the OSCE Troika on 12 April expressed“deep concern at reports of increasing numbers of violations of the ceasefire and the presence of heavy weapons in the area security in eastern Ukraine”. Furthermore, they rejected the incidents involving the monitors of the Special Monitoring Mission.Venezuela remains convinced that a military escalation and spread of the conflict should be avoided, for which the support of the international community and strict compliance with the Minsk agreements and resolutions of the Council are required. All parties should continue working to address the structural causes of the crisis, in order to achieve a firm and lasting peace. Any effort to manage the situation will succeed as long as there is dialogue and support for direct negotiations, and the parties show political will using the Minsk agreements as a guide.Venezuela is convinced and has argued in various forums of the Organization that the application of unilateral coercive sanctions are contrary to international law. In that context, we believe that the current sanctions are counterproductive to the desire for peace and stability in the region and are eroding the climate for dialogue necessary to restoring trust between the parties.In any conflict, civilians are the most affected by violence. We therefore call upon the parties to strictly abide by the obligations relating to their protection, including the need to ensure access for humanitarian assistance to residents, internally displaced persons and refugees in the affected areas. We reject violence, ethnic and political persecution and acts of terrorism, regardless of who commits them. Any incident should be independently investigated, with evidence being provided to support the conclusions of such investigations.Finally, we call on all parties to work with conviction in efforts to achieve a just and lasting political solution that is in their own interest and in that of the entire region.","We thank the Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Tayé-Brook Zerihoun, the Chief Monitor of the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Ambassador Ertuğrul Apakan, and the Special Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-office in Ukraine, Ambassador Martin Sajdik, for their briefings. We also welcome the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to this meeting.After a period of calm, with a ceasefire holding since the last quarter of 2015, violence has returned to the east of Ukraine, marking the end of a period of hope for better days in the country. Deaths of civilians, disappearances, violations of women’s rights, displacement of people, humanitarian crises and human misery will again become realities of life in eastern Ukraine unless a ceasefire and cessation of hostilities are not reinstated in earnest.We reiterate our support for the implementation of the Minsk agreements, which were endorsed by the Security Council through resolution 2202 (2015), and for a permanent ceasefire, as the prerequisites for the speedy implementation of the Minsk agreements’ package of measures and ultimately the establishment of a durable and sustainable peace in Ukraine. We are deeply concerned by the worsening conflict in eastern Ukraine. Reports of increasing ceasefire violations, mainly in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, are matters of concern. We regret the restrictions imposed on the freedom of movement of the Special Monitoring Mission and express our total disapproval that heavy weapons previously withdrawn from the front lines are missing from the permanent storage sites and are being used by the belligerents. Also of concern is the situation of internally displaced persons as a consequence of the reported incidents, while humanitarian access is increasingly restricted and serious security incidents are being reported. We regret constraints on humanitarian access and urge all parties to the conflict to facilitate the safe, rapid and unimpeded access by humanitarian organizations to the areas and people in need. Once again, we call for the immediate cessation of hostilities, the withdrawal of all heavy weapons and the full implementation of the Minsk agreement’s package of measures. We furthermore call for full access for the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission and for monitoring and verifying compliance with the Minsk agreements and urge strict respect for international commitments agreed under international guarantees so that the people of Ukraine are allowed to live in peace, freedom and security.Finally, we reiterate our support for the peaceful resolution of conflicts through dialogue and negotiations and strict respect for the principles of international law and the unity, sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
S/PV.7576,11/12/2015,Escalation of the conflict in Donbas in connection with the continuing presence of foreign fighters and the flow of weapons and ammunition into the separatist-controlled areas make the renewal of hostilities a constant possibility,"I thank the briefers for the information they have provided. For some time, the situation in eastern Ukraine has generally been stable, and the ceasefire has been maintained. The withdrawal of heavy weapons is under way. Last February, leaders from four countrie —, Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine — reached an important consensus in Minsk on a political settlement of the crisis in Ukraine. Subsequently, the Security Council adopted resolution 2202 (2015), thereby demonstrating the firm support of the international community for the diplomatic efforts of the leaders of the four countries for a political settlement of the Ukraine question. At present, all the parties should fully implement the consensus reached by the leaders of the four countries and the Council resolutions in an effort to further promote the political settlement of the crisis in Ukraine. The question of Ukraine involves a complicated history and reality. To find a fundamental and lasting solution to the problem in that country, we must address the legitimate rights, interests and concerns of all the ethnicities and regions within Ukraine, as well as the legitimate concerns of all the parties involved, in order to balance their interests. The international community should further strengthen diplomatic efforts to achieve a political settlement. China is open to a discussion of this question in the Council, and believes that the debate here should play a constructive role in alleviating the situation in Ukraine. China is opposed, as always, to the Council’s involvement in country-specific human rights issues and to the use of unilateral sanctions, or the threat of the use of sanctions freely in international relations. That is detrimental to finding a lasting solution. As always, China respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, Ukraine included, and has remained objective and impartial on the question there. China calls upon all of the parties to remain calm and exercise restraint, to fully implement the Minsk agreements and to consolidate the hard-won ceasefire, so as to achieve peace, tranquillity, stability and development in Ukraine. China will continue to play a constructive role in finding a political settlement to this question. ","I thank the Deputy Secretary-General and all the other speakers for their briefings. It was important that they had this opportunity to address us all today in order to provide the Council with a clear picture of the evolution of the situation on the ground, covering both the political and security aspects as well as the humanitarian and human rights aspects. We believe that the Council is more than ever playing the role it should by raising and addressing all of those issues together, because they are all very closely linked to the maintenance of peace and international security, and therefore all fall under the purview and responsibility of the Council. I wish to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine for his presence here today. I would like to assure him of France’s commitment to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine. The resolution of the crisis in eastern Ukraine constitutes a priority for France. The President of the Republic reiterated that point during his recent trip to Moscow by recalling how our determination to find a solution for a political settlement of the crisis remains unchanged. Within the Normandy format, France and Germany are fully committed to the complete and swift implementation of the Minsk agreements, particularly the package of measures adopted on 12 February. The political mobilization of the high-level Contact Group on Ukraine in recent months has led to significant progress on several aspects. First is the fact that there are no longer any large-scale hostilities, as there were at the beginning of the year, and a process of political settlement of the crisis is slowly taking shape. In terms of security, the ceasefire established in September is generally being respected, although it has yet to be consolidated. An agreement on the withdrawal of weapons under the 100 millimetre to 120 millimetre calibre has been implemented and is being monitored by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The number of civilian casualties has been significantly reduced. On the political front, it is now necessary to determine the terms of a draft bill for elections in the Donbas region aimed at granting special status to the territory, according to the sequence approved at the recent Normandy format summit held in Paris on 2 October. Turning to economic and humanitarian issues, the parties managed to reach agreements on concrete projects to rebuild infrastructure and on a number of prisoner exchanges. Progress has also been achieved in mine clearance. Furthermore, the European Union has done its utmost to mobilize support for the implementation of the Minsk agreements, in particular by enabling the conclusion of a gas agreement between Russia and Ukraine and by initiating trilateral consultations on the impact of the crisis on the implementation of the detailed and comprehensive free-trade agreement on the Russian economy. To a certain extent, things are therefore on the right track. Nevertheless, the situation on the ground remains extremely volatile, and we are fully aware of the difficulties that remain. The trend of increasing ceasefire violations recorded since the beginning of the month of November endangers the progress achieved so far. Those violations must cease. It is important that an agreement on the withdrawal of heavy weapons be approved and implemented immediately. The Special Monitoring Mission of the OSCE in Ukraine must also be permitted to fully exercise its mandate. In that regard, we reiterate our call for the monitors to have the benefit of unhindered access to areas controlled by the separatists, including along the entire international border with Russia, in accordance with the Minsk agreements. It is equally important that the Special Monitoring Mission be able to implement without delay the permanent outposts in accordance with its plans. The withdrawal of foreign terrorist fighters and equipment must also be carried out without delay. The lack of agreement among the parties within the political working group hinders progress towards a lasting settlement of the crisis in eastern Ukraine. We hope that the Ukrainian authorities and the separatists will constructively participate in the working group discussions aimed at reaching agreement on a draft of a special electoral bill for certain zones and regions of Donetsk and Luhansk that respects international law and OSCE standards. The economic and humanitarian situation also remains particularly troubling in Donbas. It continues to deteriorate as winter sets in, which is particularly worrying. It is vital that unhindered access be guaranteed to humanitarian organizations throughout the territory controlled by the separatists. Unfortunately, that is not the case today, and it could have devastating consequences on the population, as Mr. Ging pointed out in his briefing today with regard to the activities of Doctors Without Borders. Those hindrances cannot in any case justify the measures of unwarranted administrative control. It is also important to expand our mine-clearing operations to cover other priority areas identified by the OSCE. We urge the international community, especially the United Nations, to support those actions, both financially and technically. We also support and call for the further release of all prisoners held by the parties, which must take place as quickly as possible. We are also deeply concerned about the ongoing serious human rights violations observed in eastern Ukraine as well as the situation in Crimea, and I would like to recall that France does not recognize its illegal annexation. In those territories, the population sees their fundamental human rights and freedoms regularly violated by the de facto authorities. The repression of all dissenting voices as well as the discrimination against and constant harassment of Tatars in the Crimean region must cease. In that regard, it is essential that various human rights monitoring missions have access to the entire Ukrainian territory, including Crimea. Finally, our ultimate goal is the return of Ukraine’s control over all its territory within the internationally recognized borders, in accordance with international law. In that context, the priorities are to consolidate the security situation on the ground and to renew efforts to implement the political aspects of the Minsk agreements. Those two issues are indeed at the foundation of any long-term and lasting settlement and are inseparable. At the Paris summit of 2 October, the four Heads of State and Government of the Normandy format process agreed to postpone by several months the deadline initially set for 31 December. The Minsk agreements constitute the benchmark for a peaceful political solution to the conflict. We thereby have an appropriate framework for the solution adopted by the Council in resolution 2202 (2015). I wish to reiterate that the solution to the crisis requires the full and complete implementation, as quickly as possible, of the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements. Each party, but also every member of the Council, must meet its responsibilities in supporting the process. We will continue, together with our German partners, to mobilize in that direction, in the context of the Normandy format. A new follow-up meeting at the level of Foreign Ministers for that purpose will be held shortly. ","With all due respect to you, Madam President, I cannot fail to note that Security Council meetings should start on time. Unfortunately, the American presidency this month has introduced an element of nervousness into the work of the Council and has not always acted on the basis of consensus. The coup d’état that extremists carried out with the support of outside organizers during a wave of legal popular protest has led Ukraine into a serious economic and social crisis that has persisted for some time. Helping to find a way out of that situation is the challenge of the international community, including the Security Council. We are grateful to Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson, to the Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, Ertuğrul Apakanu, and to the Director of the Coordination and Response Division in the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, John Ging, for their briefings. With regard to the statement of Mr. Šimonović, I would note that the Mission he heads in Ukraine does not have a Security Council mandate and the subject of his statement goes beyond the remit of resolution 2202 (2015). The report of his Mission is being discussed in the Human Rights Council in Geneva. Returning to that subject now is nothing more than an attempt to divert attention from the most important task today, which is to implement the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements. It is only through the full implementation of the provisions of that document that the conflict in Donbas and the problems related to it can be resolved. The Security Council has met repeatedly on the subject of Ukraine. However, most of the meetings were of a polemical nature. An exception to that was provided by the unanimous adoption, on 17 February, of resolution 2202 (2015), which approved the package of measures of 12 February and urged all parties to fully implement it. That clear document, which presented a road map for settlement, inspired hope that the crisis could be resolved. Ten months later, we consider it logical, expedient and necessary to discuss how it is being implemented, and if it is not, why. We believe that the military provisions of the package have achieved some results. Basically, heavy weapons have been withdrawn, and even additional agreements have been concluded on weapons with a calibre of less than 100 millimetres: tanks, mortars and artillery shells. Not everything went smoothly, but the intensity of the fighting and the shelling on civilians in Donbas has been significantly reduced. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission played an important role in that regard. However, we are concerned — and this has been confirmed by the OSCE observers — that in the past month tensions have increased again. Seventy per cent of the ceasefire violations have occurred in the Donetsk region. In the area under the control of the Ukrainian armed forces, there was regular shelling in Horlivka, Zhabichevo, Zheleznaya Balka, Krasny Partizan, Spartak and Staromykhailivka. The provocative nature of those attacks can be seen from the fact that they took place at the same time as the Normandy format meetings. According to the statistics of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, the Ukrainian side bears the main responsibility for the shelling, for placing military equipment in the security zone and for using radio- jamming equipment against the unmanned aerial vehicles operated by the Special Monitoring Mission. The Ukrainian armed forces continue to deploy their forces in the region and do not hide fact that they have heavy weapons, which can be seen in the regions of Avdiivka, Volnovakha, Horlivka, Dzerzhynsk, Orlovka and Pisky. In Horlivka alone, according to Donetsk intelligence, there are 85 tanks, 12 armoured personnel carriers and 30 rocket launchers. In addition, on 4 December, the Ukrainian side arbitrarily and in violation to the existing agreements seized seven villages that were, at the time of the signing of the package, in the buffer zone and still not under the control of either party. We regard those actions as provocative. The Ukrainian troops must be withdrawn from those areas. Those questions are of course being raised in the Trilateral Contact Group and the Joint Centre for Control and Coordination. However, the Ukrainians are trying to argue that black is white, saying that the rebels are shelling themselves. They criticize the OSCE Mission and say that the problem is that it is not accountable to the Contact Group. Even the politically correct leadership of the Contact Group has had to urge them to refrain from inflammatory rhetoric. We hope that Mr. Apakan will continue to call upon the representatives of Kyiv to work constructively and avoid provocative language. It is clear that the military situation in Ukraine cannot be considered outside the context of the implementation of the political aspects of the package of measures. The problems with regard to the political area have unfortunately often led to an escalation of the situation. Currently, we do not see anything positive coming out of the implementation of such key provisions of the Minsk II package as organizing local elections, granting amnesty, providing Donbas with permanent legislation on its special status or carrying out real constitutional reform. Kyiv still refuses direct dialogue with the representatives of Donbas, contrary to what was stipulated in the Minsk agreement. The Normandy format summit that took place on 2 October in Paris should have provided some impetus towards improvements on that score. Following that meeting, the Luhansk and Donetsk authorities agreed to make concessions and postpone elections until the winter or spring of the following year, if Kyiv took specific steps as agreed upon within the Normandy quartet. However, soon after the Paris meeting of the Contact Group, the representatives of Kyiv tried to present the situation as if nothing needed to be done on their part. Therefore, by ignoring the agreements reached by the leaders of the Normandy format quartet, they returned to their previous position. For example, despite the agreement on the need to adopt a law on elections in Donbas, the Ukrainians asserted that the elections needed to be held under the existing law under which they had been held previously in the rest of Ukraine on 25 October and on 15 November. In the first place, the law is far from perfect, which became apparent during the voting. It does not provide sufficient time to monitor the elections, and the campaign preceding the elections is rendered more complicated, as is the work of the mass media. Consequently, those regions did not elect the candidates who enjoyed the support of the majority. But most important, that law was not agreed to by Donetsk and Luhansk, as stipulated by the Minsk agreements, and is in contradiction with the position that President Poroshenko made clear at the Normandy format summit in October. It is clear that Kyiv is not looking for a compromise leading to a way out of the current situation. Instead, it quickly endorsed the so-called framework on the use of the law on local elections in the Verkhovna Rada. As is well known, the package of measures also includes a number of socioeconomic steps aimed at improving the difficult humanitarian situation in Donbas. Logically, achieving progress in de-escalating the military situation should have led to resolving some of those glaring problems and building a climate of trust. However, Kyiv continues the economic blockade of Donbas, while ignoring the relevant recommendations of international organizations. The population of Donbas cannot count on having quality medical care. They have limited access to safe drinking water and basic services. Depriving the residents of Donbas of their pensions and social benefits and hindering the delivery of food and other essential goods demonstrate Kyiv’s true desire to harm the people of the region. There is an absence of services, such as the mobile banking stations along the line of contact, through which Ukraine is supposed to provide benefit payments to the population of Donbas. Moreover, the blockade is accompanied by a number of absurd actions on the part of the Kyiv authorities. The authorities continue to be brought to trial in their own Ukrainian courts just to avoid paying benefits to the residents of Donbas. On 16 October, the highest administrative court of Ukraine ruled that it was illegal to suspend the disbursement of social benefits to citizens of the Donbas and Luhansk regions and ordered their resumption. And that was not the first time a Ukrainian court had handed down such a decision. I am sorry to say this, but in this pre-winter season, with increasing cold weather, the Ukrainian leadership has quietly been encouraging those who are working to make the situation for the people in that area unbearable. The power supply to Donbas is unstable and there has been no effort to improve the damaged water supply, which is the result of shelling a 300-kilometer- long section of a water supply system that used to supply 400,000 people. In such an extremely difficult humanitarian situation in the south-east of Ukraine, Russia continues to offer humanitarian aid to the people of the Donbas region, which has been isolated by Kyiv, including medicine, warm clothing and food for hospitals, schools and community centres, among other forms of assistance. By 9 December, 46 convoys had delivered approximately 56 thousand tons of goods. As one can see, the implementation of the package of measures, is, to say the least, being hampered. It would seem that no one is interested in freezing the conflict in the south-east of Ukraine, but in order to ensure a viable outcome and its final settlement, there needs to be political will on the part of the direct participants, which is clearly lacking, especially on the Ukrainian side. We have already discussed how Kyiv behaved after the Normandy format summit in Paris, where the agreements reached were simply disregarded. A mere appearance of dialogue with the people of Donbas and Luhansk emerged in the subgroups of the Contact Group, but the bellicose rhetoric on the part of Kyiv abounds and the military preparations continue. What are we to say when we see diplomatic efforts under way yet, at the same time, a seventh mobilization campaign is being planned and enormous amounts of scanty State funds are being generously spent on weapons? The deplorable situation in Ukraine is well known. Along with a very difficult economic situation, there is an ongoing struggle for power — reminiscent of gang violence — endemic corruption and an inability to establish Government administration even in regions that strongly supported the Maidan protests. There are many problems in Ukraine with the administration of the legal system. There is much evidence of human rights violations by the Ukrainian security forces and mercenary battalions, including torture, general mistreatment, abductions, arbitrary detention and extrajudicial punishment. The crimes committed in the Maidan have not been investigated, and the snipers and provocateurs are still walking free. No one has been brought to justice for the terrible murders of the victims in Odessa. International observers note the absence of efficiency and objectivity in investigations, which are being intentionally drawn out, and the efforts by the authorities to conceal the results of the investigations. There is growing pressure on the courts. The Ukrainian authorities are still prosecuting civilian activists from the opposition. Human rights activists continue to condemn Kyiv’s actions with regard to its restrictions on the media and its exerting pressure on journalists. Kyiv is also surreptitiously selling weapons and military equipment to the Middle East through very dubious channels. Those could possibly wind up in the hands of terrorists. We are not ruling out the fact that, in order to conceal the problems in its domestic policy, the Kiev authorities continue not only to undermine the peace process in Donbas, but are also promoting military provocations. It is clear that one of the factors behind the political situation and the actions of the Kyiv authorities is the spread of the ideology of extremism in parts of Ukrainian society, including neo-Nazism and aggressive nationalism. That is the sort of ideology led to the coup d’état in Kyiv in 2014 and the later so- called counter-terrorist operation in the south-east of the country. We are convinced that, as long as the expression of such ideology is justified as part of the right to freedom of expression and as a potential factor in consolidating the country and society, we cannot legitimize the authorities in Kyiv. We were shocked to hear that a new Ukrainian military transport aircraft has been christened the Bandera, after the Nazi collaborator. Will they paint a swastika on it? A glaring example of the outrages committed by the armed nationalist radicals was the destruction of the transmission lines supplying electricity to Crimea, which has resulted in a crisis for schools, hospitals and other facilities on the peninsula. That threatened the lives of patients on life-support and constitutes a gross violation of the right to life. The Kyiv authorities have demonstrated their complete inability to react to or condemn such actions. The position of a number of States that claim to want the best for Ukraine is unhelpful in that regard. Recently, the Vice-President of the United States went to Kyiv. Addressing the Verkhovna Rada, he spoke about Minsk agreements. He said that Russia was presenting an obstacle to the implementation of the Minsk agreements. But everyone knows that Russia cannot modify the Ukrainian Constitution, adopt laws regulating elections in Ukraine or grant amnesty. It is puzzling that, in a similar vein, he did not take that opportunity to call on Ukrainian lawmakers and the President of Ukraine who hold such power. In conclusion, we confirm that there is no alternative to the implementation of the Minsk agreements of 12 February and of resolution 2202 (2015). We are pleased that, although the work of the Trilateral Contact Group is difficult, its participants are working in an orderly manner. Unfortunately, our discussion today did not reach the requisite level of objective analysis with respect to the implementation of the Minsk agreements and resolution 2202 (2015). The pervasive lies in the statement of the representative of the United States of America prove that throughout the crisis in Ukraine, from its inception right to today, Washington, D.C., by supporting its Kyiv partners, is playing a destructive role that departs from the context of the Normandy format. That is certainly one of the reasons that work on a political settlement is not so simple. Frankly speaking, there was no greater objectivity in the statement by the Ukrainian Minister for Foreign Affairs. Most important, he did not say that the Ukrainian leadership understood its responsibility for implementing the Minsk agreements of 12 February and resolution 2202 (2015), which made that into a legally binding document. The Kyiv authorities did the opposite — and not just once — they undermined the opportunity for a political settlement to the crisis in Ukraine. Under both the Normandy format and in the Tripartite Contact Group, Russia is carrying out its responsibilities. It will continue to do so. We hope that the political will necessary for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and resolution 2202 (2015) will prevail in the end among the Ukrainian authorities as well. Perhaps it really is time for a new approach. ","I welcome the briefings today from the Deputy Secretary-General and from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Given the interconnected nature of all the issues that the United Nations deals with, whether in Ukraine or elsewhere — peace, security, development, human rights, humanitarian affairs — it is imperative that the Council have a full picture. I am very glad that we have been able to do so today. I also welcome the presence in the Council of the Foreign Ministers of Ukraine and Lithuania. The situation in Ukraine is deeply worrying for three major reasons. First, the Minsk agreements remain unfulfilled, and peace remains elusive. Secondly, the humanitarian situation is worsening, and will only continue to do so during winter. Thirdly, Crimea remains illegally annexed, and its people’s human rights remain oppressed. Let me take up each of those in turn. First, as we have heard today, progress on the diplomatic track has slowed, and ceasefire violations are on the increase. Last month saw spikes in the fighting in eastern Ukraine, with fatalities fast approaching pre-September levels. At a conservative estimate, over 9,000 people have now been killed, and more than 20,000 wounded, since the fighting began. Many recent casualties are a direct result of the abhorrent use of landmines and booby traps. Others have been caused by heavy weapons, the same heavy weapons that were supposed to have been withdrawn under the Minsk agreements. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission makes clear where the blame lies. The majority of violations have been committed by the separatists. It is imperative that the ceasefire be respected by all parties. Not only is the ceasefire vital to the success of the Minsk agreements, it will also allow collective action to undertake meaningful demining in eastern Ukraine. Landmines and other explosive remnants of war continue to inflict casualties on an almost daily basis. The priority must be to map the areas of contamination and agree a coordinated approach for their removal. That cannot be achieved while hostilities are ongoing. There is one Council member here today whose influence can bring an end to the fighting and whose pressure can deliver a political solution to the crisis. We all look to Russia to make every effort in that regard, both by using its influence on the separatists and by withdrawing its troops and equipment that still remain in Ukraine. Russia can also have a meaningful impact on my second point: the worsening humanitarian situation. The separatists continue to deny access to both the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission and international humanitarian agencies. That cannot continue. Sadly, at the moment, Russia’s influence only seems to increase tensions. So-called humanitarian convoys enter Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian authorities, in clear violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. There have been 42 such convoys since August 2014, and they must cease. With over 1.4 million people internally displaced and an estimated 2 million people living in areas near the fighting, the humanitarian challenge in Ukraine is enormous. The recent opening of three humanitarian logistics centres by Ukraine is a welcome move to ease civilian suffering, but we regret the continued deaths of civilians from landmines owing to the lack of sanitation facilities at checkpoints. That needs to be addressed. Sadly, the situation will only get worse over winter. All aid agencies must be allowed to aid preparations for cold weather across Ukraine. If access continues to be restricted, aid agencies will be unable to transport, store or deliver critical supplies to thousands of affected people. A failure to do so will only lead to more suffering and more deaths. Turning to my final point, it has now been 21 months since the illegal annexation of Crimea. In that time, the human rights situation has deteriorated. We hear regular reports, including from Mr. Šimonović today, of repression and restrictions of the fundamental freedoms of assembly, association, expression and belief. The United Nations Human Rights Mission in Ukraine noted in its report this month that most human rights abuses in Crimea have been directed at Crimean Tartars and people supporting Crimea’s rightful place in the Ukrainian State. With temperatures falling and a road blockade denying access to food and provisions, the humanitarian situation on the peninsula is getting worse. The electricity crisis is exacerbating the problem, and we have raised the urgent need to restore the damaged electricity power lines with the Ukrainian Government. Let me conclude by thanking the briefers again for their contributions. I hope that the Council, working together and alongside the relevant agencies and regional associations, can help ensure that 2016 is a more peaceful year for all people in Ukraine. I look forward to working with all Council members, both old and new, in making that a reality. ","In accordance with rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite the representative of Ukraine to participate in this meeting. In accordance with rule 39 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite the following briefers to participate in this meeting: Mr. Ivan Šimonović, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights; Mr. John Ging, Director of the Coordination and Response Division of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs; and Ambassador Ertuğrul Apakan, Chief Monitor of the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. On behalf of the Council, I welcome Mr. Ging and Ambassador Apakan, who are joining today’s meeting via video-teleconference from Kiev. The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. I wish to warmly welcome the Deputy Secretary- General, His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, and I give him the floor. I would first like to join my colleagues in thanking our briefers — Deputy Secretary-General Eliasson, Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović, Director of Operations Ging and Ambassador Apakan. Teams from the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) are active on the ground, working in extremely difficult conditions, and we would like to express the gratitude of the United States and, I am sure, of the broader international community to them. We thank Foreign Minister Klimkin and Foreign Minister Linkevičius for joining us. I would like to start by apologizing for the late start to this meeting; the delay was unavoidable and very important to protecting the integrity of the Security Council. I also must stress the absolute criticality and centrality of the independent reporting of facts to the implementation of the Minsk agreements and of resolution 2202 (2015). In arguing, as the Russian Ambassador did earlier, that the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) should not brief, one does wonder what Russia seeks to hide. But we understand its very unfortunate desire to prevent the Council from hearing inconvenient facts, and it is absolutely essential that we not let that happen and that the facts be presented such as they are. As we have heard today, the present situation in Ukraine looks different than it did when we last met in June, just a few days, then, after a combined Russian separatist force offensive that coordinated attacks west of the ceasefire line in Donetsk. But the horrific situation back in June cannot become the baseline for our assessments or our actions. While major combat is down since the 1 September ceasefire, and that is extremely important for all of the lives affected, this crisis remains no less real, no less urgent and no less troubling. There are still, as we have heard, daily ceasefire violations, and, as has been described in great detail today, the citizens of Ukraine, all of Ukraine, continue to suffer enormously. Let us be clear about why we are gathered again and what continues to drive this crisis. We are here because Russia continues to occupy Ukraine’s autonomous region of Crimea, in defiance of international law, its treaty obligations, the Helsinki Final Act and resolution 68/262, adopted by 100 members of the General Assembly, which rejected the phony Crimea referendum and called for Ukraine’s territorial integrity to be respected. Its authorities there have opened criminal cases against critics of the occupation and specifically targeted the Tatar community, subjecting them to beatings, arbitrary detention and police raids. We are here because even today Moscow continues to arm, train, support and fight alongside separatists in eastern Ukraine. On Wednesday, OHCHR confirmed the continued “inflow of ammunition, weaponry and fighters from the Russian Federation into the territories controlled by the armed groups”. A robust combined Russian separatist military force, led by Russian officers, continues to operate in Ukrainian territory. We are here because Moscow and the separatists continue to obstruct international monitoring efforts, undermining the ceasefire and the prospects for peace. Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) monitors face obstruction on a daily basis. Just this past weekend, OSCE monitors on patrol were threatened by separatists with automatic rifles. We are here because, in blatant disregard for the commitments that have been made, the Russian-backed separatists continue to attack Ukrainian positions along the line of contact almost every day, at times with mortars banned under weapons-withdrawal agreements. Ukrainian soldiers and civilians continue to be killed or wounded in these attacks, and we cannot afford to get used to that. The cumulative impact of Moscow’s aggression remains the widespread and unnecessary suffering of Ukrainian civilians. Almost 1.5 million people are unable to return to their homes, their schools or their daily lives. Winter has arrived, and as many as 300,000 people residing along the contact line are in need of blankets, fuel and clothes to get them through the cold weather. Yet despite the urgent need, few relief organizations are able to work in the separatist-controlled areas, because, as we heard from John Ging, the separatists suspended and expelled United Nations and international humanitarian organizations in July. Only a fraction of the aid required by the 2 million people in need in these areas is getting through. We heard earlier a very moving account by the Ambassador of the Russian Federation on the plight of people living in Donbas, yet it is Russia’s separatists that expelled humanitarian organizations and, by and large, have not let them resume their functions. We urge Moscow to finally honour the commitments that it made when it signed the Minsk agreements and ensure that separatists lift restrictions and allow the immediate resumption of critically needed aid. We also encourage the Government of Ukraine to accelerate efforts to facilitate the movement of civilians and cargo across the contact line and continue the provision of social, educational and economic benefits to internally displaced persons and others in need. There has also been a deeply concerning deterioration of the human rights situation in Donbas, as described in depth by the United Nations human rights monitoring mission. Their report this week notes “new allegations of killings, torture and ill-treatment, illegal detention and forced labour” in separatist- controlled areas. The self-appointed authorities in the east have systematically failed to stop, investigate or hold to account those believed responsible for abuses and ill-treatment. The mission also reported incidents in areas controlled by the Ukrainian Government; we urge the Government to immediately investigate all serious and credible allegations. Just as we know who is driving this conflict, we know what must be done to end it. The September 2014 and February 2015 Minsk agreements are the best and only way to achieve peace in eastern Ukraine. Over the six months since we last met, we have seen how even incomplete steps towards the implementation of Minsk, like the 1 September cease-fire, can reduce casualties and provide space for progress on other fronts. What is needed now, what is long overdue is the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. All sides must seize the opportunity to bring this conflict to a peaceful end. This year has seen some progress in this direction, with fewer casualties and some limited weapons withdrawals. Now is the time to implement Minsk and settle this conflict. This would allow the people of Ukraine to resume a normal life and focus on building the democratic European society that Ukrainians have fought and, in many cases, died for. Let me be specific about the path to peace laid out by the Minsk agreements. Most immediately, the daily violations of the ceasefire line must come to an end. Heavy weapons must be withdrawn from the front line, and the OSCE must be allowed full access all the way to the border. Legitimate local elections must then be held in Donbas. Minsk is crystal-clear on the requirements for these elections: they must be held according to Ukrainian law and OSCE standards, and they must be held under OSCE observation. In October, President Putin recommitted to these Minsk-required standards and agreed on the urgent need for the sides to agree on election mechanics that conform to these standards. But since then, Russia and the separatists have rejected proposals by Ukraine and the OSCE because they included elements such as free media access and the right of Ukrainian political parties to participate. While the rest of Ukraine held local elections on 25 October and 15 November, residents of Donbas continue to be deprived of legitimately elected representatives, and Russia and its surrogates continue to stonewall the work of the Trilateral Contact Group. Holding legitimate elections is the key to unlocking the remaining steps of Minsk and enabling the separatist- held territories to be peacefully reintegrated back into the Ukrainian political and legal system. As agreed in Paris in October, the elections must be followed by the implementation of Ukraine’s special-status law and the entry into force of the amnesty legislation. Constitutional reform must also occur, and Ukraine has been working towards this for many months. Its draft amendments on decentralization were endorsed by the Venice Commission’s international legal experts and in August received the first of two required approvals by Parliament. Finally, Russia and the separatists must fulfil other outstanding Minsk obligations, which include withdrawing all foreign fighters and military equipment, releasing all hostages and unlawfully detained persons, including Nadia Savchenko and Oleg Sentsov, and turning over control of the international border back to the sovereign Government of Ukraine. When all sides faithfully uphold their commitments, we will see progress on this conflict. Until then, there will be casualties, and their number will inevitably rise. Let me conclude by trying to humanize the stakes. Marina Reznik is 13 years old. On a Saturday back in January, Marina was visiting her father in a residential neighbourhood of Mariupol. That day, separatists announced an offensive against the city. The rocket fire that followed killed at least 29 people and injured 97 others. Marina was one of those injured. When the shell hit the house, her father tried to use his body to shield her, but two shell fragments sliced into her. One hit her spinal cord. Nearly a year later, Marina, whose love of dance led her to dream of being a professional hip- hop dancer, still cannot feel her right leg. She cannot walk. Instead of dancing, she now hopes to help other children who have been affected by this conflict. We are here today because of Moscow’s aggression, because of how it continues to fuel this conflict and because of how this conflict hurts innocent people like Marina. We will continue meeting about this crisis. We will continue to insist that we hear the facts until the aggression ceases and until Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are restored. We urge Moscow to choose the path of peace and uphold its Minsk commitments. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. I give the floor to Mr. Pavlo Klimkin, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. ",,,,,,,,,,,"I thank you, Madam President, for convening today’s meeting. It has been a while since the Security Council discussed the situation in and around Ukraine (see S/PV.7498), a situation that is fluid and dangerous. The details have changed, but not the basics. The Russian aggression has reached new heights; it most certainly has not stopped. Crimea is under occupation. Donbas is under attack. Minsk looks like a jigsaw puzzle that has not been put together—hopefully it will be. It is high time that we took a closer look at things.I thank my friend Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevičius for helping to convene this meeting. I also thank the briefers — Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson, Assistant Secretary-General Ivan Šimonović, Chief Monitor of the Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Ertuğrul Apakan, and Director of the Coordination and Response Division of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs John Ging — for their informative contributions to this meeting.Almost 300 days have passed since the adoption of resolution 2202 (2015), by which the Council unanimously endorsed the Minsk agreements. Months have passed. Hundreds and thousands of people have died. Why are the Minsk agreements not yet implemented? Why has peace not been reached?Reaching peace is a matter of motivation. Peace is possible only if peace is wanted. Ukraine wants peace, because peace is our chance at survival. Is Russia motivated? That is an open question. Right after the Minsk accords were agreed, in February, we expected, at the very least, that the ceasefire would be implemented. We expected to see the withdrawal of weapons and troops within days or weeks. We expected a final political solution to be reached by the end of 2015. That was the expectation when the parties to the Minsk accords were signing them.However, the ink of the Russian signature was not yet dry when the Russian regular army, along with pro-Russian proxies, launched a full-scale military attack on Debaltseve. Ukraine kept suffering. It now seems that Russia is still wondering whether that was enough or whether it should go on. The actions in the small town of Debaltseve were a tour de force, just a preview of how Russia would “implement” the Minsk accords. It started a pattern that we continue to see up to now: sabotage, blockade and lies.What did Ukraine do while Russia was tormenting our minds and souls? It is very simple: Ukrainian forces ceased their fire, as was verified by the OSCE among others, and withdrew their weapons. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission got full access to all areas under the control of the Government of Ukraine. Despite endless provocations and shelling by Russia-supported terrorists, Ukraine, in cooperation with the OSCE and the international community, made every effort to implement its commitments to avert a humanitarian crisis. We have been paying social benefits to the residents of occupied Donbas and to everyone who is able to escape from the Russian-proxy-controlled area. And we have given without the expectation of reimbursement.Ukraine is establishing special humanitarian logistics centres and is carrying out projects on infrastructure reconstruction, with thousands of people coming to the centres every day. With the withdrawal of the security clearance, teams have been sent out to repair the damage to critical electricity and water supply infrastructure. After an inclusive national dialogue, including with representatives of the Donbas region, the Ukrainian Parliament adopted, at first reading, some constitutional amendments on decentralization, stipulating a special order on local self-government in certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Furthermore, as previously mentioned, Ukraine presented to the Trilateral Contact Group a concept paper on modalities for holding local elections in Donbas. Finally, we have been providing comprehensive support to the OSCE to enable it to implement its mandate throughout the entire territory of Ukraine.But let us look at the other side. What has the Russian Federation done as a party to the Minsk agreements? It has done essentially nothing. Instead, Russia and Russian-backed illegal armed formations have engaged in provocations and massive assaults, thus rendering the ceasefire exceedingly fragile. It has failed to withdraw its heavy and lighter weapons, manoeuvring and hiding them in the prohibited areas. It has blocked access by the Special Monitoring Mission to the areas under its control. It has refused to release hostages in Donbas and the political prisoners being held in Russian prisons, such as Nadiya Savchenko, Alexander Kolchenko and others. It has hindered the activities of the international humanitarian organizations in the region, including Doctors Without Borders. It has rejected the holding of local elections in Donbas in accordance with Ukrainian legislation and international standards. It has impeded any sort of involvement of the OSCE. And, naturally, Russia keeps rotating and reinforcing its military contingent in occupied Donbas.Previously, the Council heard from the Russian representative that Russia is not a party to the conflict. It is the same old narrative about the conflict being a domestic one. Once again, it has been said by the Russian side, not just today but many times, that the Russian military personnel there are simply on vacation. But the truth can be proved in many ways: just two weeks ago we exchanged a Russian major for one of our own who was being held hostage. Russia can claim that Elvis is alive, but no amount of lying can ever change the facts.We need to think about why the Russian narrative is so diametrically opposed to everything we have heard today from all four briefers. Is Russia living in a different reality? My answer would be, by no means. We are continuing to hear the same propaganda from Russia as we heard at the beginning, the reason being that the Russians want a Russian Donbas in a Russian Ukraine. Our simple goal is the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. Through peace, we can have a normal life and the return of law and order. What we want is a Ukrainian Donbas and peace for the Ukrainian people of Donbas in Ukraine. That is why Russia is telling all these lies.It is not Ukrainians fighting against Russia, but the other way around. It is not Ukraine sending weapons to Russia, but the other way around. And it is not Ukraine annexing Russian land, but the other way around.Since the Minsk agreements were signed, Ukrainian forces and civilian locations have been shelled or attacked more than 13,500 times. Russian forces and pro-Russian proxies carried out multiple massive offensives on Debaltseve on 15 February, Maryinka and Shchastya on 3 June, Starohnativka on 10 June and Shyrokyne on many occasions. There was a time recently when the death toll stopped rising. That is over now. Things are deteriorating again. The trend is very bad. The only chance to prevent things from backsliding into full-blown is via a full commitment to the Minsk agreements, not in words but in deeds. They may not be perfect, but they are the only way to end what is happening in Donbas. Ukraine is fully committed to the agreements as our bridge into the future. We will not burn them.But why should Russia be motivated to stop this? Things will not change until Russia changes its attitude. It must adhere to resolution 2202 (2015). It must implement all core elements of sustainable de-escalation. It must cease armed provocations against Ukrainian forces in Donbas, provide full access to the OSCE missions to the State border between Russia and Ukraine, verifiably stop supporting militants in Donbas, withdraw its troops and weaponry from the territory of Ukraine, start genuine, practical discussions on modalities for the reinstatement of full control of the border by Ukraine, and, of course, work clearly towards a real electoral regime in accordance with the criteria of the OSCE and Ukrainian law. If any of those indispensable elements of de-escalation is sabotaged, the outcome will be fragmented and unstable, as can be seen today. To secure sustainable de-escalation, coherent international action is necessary.Back in March, Ukraine formally requested the United Nations to deploy a peacekeeping mission in order to support implementation of the Minsk agreements. That mission, or its probable alternative — the expansion of the mandate of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission — would be essential for implementing such Minsk provisions as, inter alia, disarming the illegal armed formations, monitoring and verifying the withdrawal of Russian troops and weapons, delivering and distributing humanitarian assistance and securing an environment for local elections according to OSCE standards. I urge the Security Council once again to assume leadership in establishing such a mission.Against the backdrop of the recent awful terrorist attacks, we should not forget the innocent victims of the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. One year after that incident, a group of like-minded States, seeking justice for victims and their families, initiated the establishment of an international mechanism that would have the highest international legitimacy, effectiveness, accountability and transparency for bringing those responsible to account. Not surprisingly, only one State blocked the adoption of the draft resolution in that regard (see S/PV.7498). However, the Russian veto did not discourage us, quite the opposite. The vote on the draft resolution concerning the crash of Flight MH-17 was the moment of truth, and truth is what we want. Ukraine is working closely with Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and other grieving nations to identify another credible and effective mechanism for delivering justice. Ukraine believes that the Security Council should remain actively seized of th3 matter. When the time is right, the Council must send a clear message that it will not tolerate any infringements on the safety of civil aviation and the delivery of justice — first and foremost for those who lost their daughters, sons, grandfathers and grandmothers in that terrible disaster.In violation of General Assembly resolution 68/262, the Ukrainian Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol remain occupied by the Russian Federation, which continues to pursue its policy of oppression against the local population, espedially Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians. I would recall that, under international law, Russia bears responsibility as an occupying authority. We call on Russia to immediately put a halt to human rights violations and allow international human rights monitors free and unconditional access to Crimea.Every war is a perversion. War perverts nature, God and humanity. Still, history has not seen many wars more perverted than this one. This is a war between people who often speak the same language, read the same books and listen to the same music. They got along pretty well until propaganda convinced the Russians that Ukraine was ruled by Nazis. It is a war that officially does not exist, against an enemy that never existed. It is a war that makes Russia feel strong but that in reality makes it weak. It is a war of the past against the future. We have to stop it. Let us use the opportunity of Minsk before it slips away.It has been said that a mistake repeated is not a mistake, but a decision. More than 9,000 people have died between 2014 and 2015 because of Russia’s decisions. The time has come for new attitude. Ukraine does not want to impose anything on other nations. But we will not sacrifice our own freedom for anything in the world. All we want is peace and quiet and to decide our own destiny — and once the aggression is over, we definitely will. Those who came to make war must go. Those who killed those 9,000 must, and will, be punished. Those who were simply fooled by propaganda can be forgiven. And those who thought they would break Ukraine’s will must realize that they failed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We are very grateful for the information provided to the Council by Deputy Secretary-General Eliasson; Mr. Šimonović, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights; Ambassador Apakan, Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine; and by Mr. Ging, Director of the Coordination and Response Division of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. I also thank the Lithuanian delegation for the initiative of convening this meeting.The last time that the Council met for a comprehensive overview of the situation in Ukraine was several months ago, in June (S/PV.7457). Spain favours the Council maintaining a close and watchful eye on the situation in Ukraine, together with the ongoing process of the Minsk agreements.My delegation regrets the increase in hostilities seen since the beginning of November along the contact line. We also regret the fact, and as we have heard today, that compliance with the Minsk agreements is not moving ahead at the pace we all desire. Spain therefore calls for a rekindling of the spirit of understanding that the countries gathered under the Normandy format have always tried to foster, with a view to advancing full compliance with the Minsk agreements.That is why that process must play a decisive role in the resolution of the crisis. It is not a perfect process, nor does it cover all aspects of the crisis. Nonetheless, it continues to be the only solution available and the most appropriate one if we are to achieve a political solution to the conflict that should never have taken place in the first place and has already lasted far too long. That is why it is critical to maintain the ceasefire and implement the commitments on the withdrawal of heavy weapons, thus enabling the political efforts to lead to lasting results.Spain also acknowledges and highly values the important work being carried out by the Special Monitoring Mission of the OSCE. It is essential to provide access to all areas of the territory so as to enable the Mission to fulfil its mandate. Moreover, it is crucial that all parties to the conflict scrupulously and without exception respect the status of the Special Monitoring Mission, as well as its members.It is also essential and urgent that all of the stakeholders involved renew and strengthen their political will and efforts order to guarantee the full and effective implementation of the Minsk agreements. In that connection, I would like to reiterate Spain’s resolute support for President Poroshenko and his determination to pursue legal and constitutional reform that will provide stability and progress for his country and the people of Ukraine. Some additional reforms are still needed for the swift holding of local elections in the eastern part of the country, in accordance with the Minsk process.We are deeply troubled by the persistence of serious human rights violations, particularly in those areas controlled by the self-styled republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were condemned in the recent report of the Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. There are also reports of human rights violations in Crimea and clashes and acts of aggression suffered by the Tatar minority in the peninsula.Against that backdrop, I would like to refer to the recent report issued in November by the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities, Madam Thors. The report called for a tolerant and diverse society to be fostered and supported under a solid, robust institutional framework. The effective protection of the human rights of all residents of each and every region of Ukraine must remain an ongoing priority. We welcome the recent adoption, in August, by the President of Ukraine, of the first national human rights strategy. It is our hope that it can be swiftly and thoroughly rolled out and applied across the territory of Ukraine in accordance with the plan of action that has been announced. We also welcome the acceptance of the jurisdictional competence of the International Criminal Court to investigate future crimes under the Rome Statute.The role played by the Special Monitoring Mission in terms of information and awareness-raising in human rights is also equally important and enjoys our full support. Access must therefore be granted to the Mission throughout the entire territory of Ukraine, without any restrictions. On the humanitarian track, we are particularly concerned by the fate of the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons both within Ukraine and the refugees in neighbouring countries. It would be remiss of me not to mention the numerous civilian victims who continue to lose their lives or suffer injury each day as a result of the conflict. On the other hand, the onset of winter is at our door, which gives rise to further concern about the need to provide humanitarian aid to those in non-government controlled areas. We believe that hindering humanitarian access to the non-Government controlled areas cannot continue, because those efforts include actors such as Doctors Without Borders. Hundreds of thousands depend continuously on humanitarian aid to survive and there can be excuse to hamper that work.I conclude by recalling the fact that my delegation wishes to again draw attention to General Assembly resolution 68/262, and our firm conviction that any lasting solution needs to include respect for the political independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.","I would like to thank Deputy Secretary-General Eliasson, Mr. Šimonović, Mr. Ging and Ambassador Apakan for their briefings today. I also welcome the participation of the Foreign Ministers of Ukraine and Lithuania in this meeting.In resolution 2202 (2015), the Council unanimously called on all parties to implement the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements, which was to have been completed by the end of this year, less than 20 days from now. We are very concerned at the slow progress, and we urge renewed efforts to ensure full compliance with the commitments under the agreements, which, as others have noted, offer the best chance for a durable peace.As the briefers have outlined today, the continuing presence of foreign fighters and the flow of weapons and ammunition into the separatist-controlled areas make the renewal of hostilities a constant possibility. New Zealand calls on all the parties to the conflict to deliver on their commitments to a genuine and sustained ceasefire and to the verified withdrawal of proscribed weapons.On the political track, a number of key outstanding elements of the Minsk process still need to be resolved. We urge the parties to reach agreement on the modalities for free and fair elections in the conflict areas, in accordance with Ukrainian law and with Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) standards, and for elections to be monitored by the OSCE. The restoration of lasting peace to the region requires the restoration of Ukraine’s control over its border with Russia. In order for that to occur, the parties will need to reach agreement on, and implement, all of the political elements of the Minsk agreements.All parties to the conflict agreed that the OSCE would play a special role in monitoring and verifying compliance with the Minsk agreements. Yet the OSCE continues daily to report significant restrictions on its access throughout eastern Ukraine. The separatists must comply with all the obligations undertaken in Minsk, including by ensuring that OSCE monitors are able to carry out their work effectively and safely. We call on Russia to use its considerable influence over the separatists to ensure such compliance.The twelfth report on the human rights situation in Ukraine by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights records a troubling list of human rights abuses in eastern Ukraine and Crimea, including a lack of protection and justice for victims, impunity for perpetrators on both sides and a prevailing climate of fear in the separatist-controlled territories. We call for urgent independent oversight of places of detention and for investigation and accountability for all violations of human rights. It is clear that the humanitarian problems are large, with millions of affected people in the conflict area. As we have heard today, the situation is already dire in some areas. With the further onset of winter, the already difficult lives of civilians affected by conflict in Ukraine will become even more perilous.As we have also heard, critical infrastructure has been damaged in the conflict and is in need of repair. Many are without adequate shelter owing to the shelling of residential areas. Secure access to food has become increasingly challenging. Landmines and unexploded ordnance are posing a critical risk to civilians, thereby underscoring the need for mine clearance and mine awareness on both sides of the conflict line.The difficult situation facing civilians has been greatly exacerbated by the restrictions imposed on humanitarian actors in recent months, such as purported registration requirements enforced by the separatists. We call on all parties to do everything within their power to ensure that humanitarian assistance can freely reach those who need it in Ukraine.The Council has previously determined to remain seized of the situation in Ukraine. Until fundamental issues have been resolved, it is right that the Council continues to monitor the situation very closely.","I would like to join other Council members in expressing our appreciation to all of today’s briefers for their insightful assessments of the latest situation in Ukraine. I would also like to acknowledge the presence of the Foreign Ministers of Lithuania and Ukraine, who are with us here today. Almost half a year has gone by since the Council last met on this issue (see S/PV.7498), and we would like to believe that the situation in Ukraine is stabilizing. Listening to the briefers, however, we share the concerns that other Council members have expressed about the security, humanitarian and human rights situations in Ukraine.Malaysia takes note of the progress made so far in implementing the 13 points in the Minsk agreements, particularly on the maintenance of the ceasefire, the withdrawal of weapons, the release of hostages and work on constitutional reforms. However, that progress is far from being irreversible. We therefore call on all parties to comply fully with the provisions of the Minsk agreements. In particular, we urge them to cooperate fully with the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), in order to enable it to carry out its mandate, including by providing the OSCE with full and unhindered access to rebel-held areas in the Donbas region and with the information it needs to verify the withdrawal of heavy weapons.Malaysia looks forward to further progress being made by both sides on determining the modalities of local elections in certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, as laid down in the Minsk agreements and in accordance with the laws of Ukraine. We take note of the extension of the time frame for the implementation of the agreements from the end of this year to the end of 2016. Rather than pointing fingers about who might be causing the delays in implementing the agreements, the parties should engage in good-faith negotiations and use the breathing space created to redouble their efforts to deal with the issues of constitutional reform and decentralization of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.Malaysia is deeply concerned about the allegations of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in Ukraine. We urge all the parties to comply with international law and international humanitarian law, particularly where it concerns the protection of civilians. Reports of the summary execution and arbitrary detention of civilians and of torture and forced disappearance must be thoroughly investigated in order to ensure accountability. We also call on the parties to respect the people’s rights to freedom of opinion and expression and to peaceful assembly. In that regard, Malaysia welcomes the progress made by the Ukrainian Government in introducing a national human rights strategy in August and looks forward to its implementation via an action plan. We also urge all parties to allow safe and unrestricted humanitarian access to those in need. We would like to emphasize that humanitarian assistance must be carried out in accordance with international law, international humanitarian law and respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.We remain concerned about the insidious increase in violations of human rights in Crimea, especially of the right to life, liberty, security and physical integrity, to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, and to an education in one’s native language. We urge the de facto authorities in Crimea to provide access to the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in order to enable it to carry out its mandate effectively. Malaysia would like to recall General Assembly resolution 68/262, adopted last year by an overwhelming majority of Member States, on the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. We share the assessment of the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights that compliance with the resolution is crucial if we are to see an environment conducive to the promotion and protection of human rights in Ukraine.In conclusion, Malaysia reaffirms its commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, including respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We also reiterate that full compliance with the February Minsk agreements, as endorsed by the Council in resolution 2202 (2015), is crucial to rebuilding trust and confidence in order to achieve a political solution to the conflict. Any military solution is unsustainable in the long run and will only result in further humanitarian disaster. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the tireless efforts and dedication of the various humanitarian organizations, including the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, in providing assistance and basic services to those affected by the Ukrainian crisis. We also greatly appreciate the work of the OSCE and the Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. And we affirm the important role of the Normandy format and Trilateral Contact Group, and urge the relevant parties to intensify their cooperation in good faith via those frameworks.","We would like to welcome the presence here today of the Deputy Secretary-General, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, the Director of the Coordination and Response Division of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reiterates that the full implementation of resolution 2202 (2015), which supports the decision adopted in Minsk on 12 February by the representatives of Ukraine, the Russia Federation, France and Germany, is essential as part of the consolidation of efforts to be pursued by the parties in the quest for a political and peaceful solution to the crisis in Ukraine.During the meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) troika against the backdrop of the Ministerial Council meeting on 3 December, the Foreign Ministers of Serbia, Switzerland and Germany reaffirmed their full support for the political process within the framework of the Trilateral Contact Group and the work of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine. Furthermore, they expressed their concern in the light of the fact that, although the ceasefire was holding, periods of relative or absolute calm were nonetheless frequently interspersed with intense and targeted fighting. We are unequivocal in our demand that the parties to the conflict must be determined and unrelenting in working towards delivering a complete and sustainable peace. A definitive cessation of hostilities therefore constitutes a vital goal that cannot be postponed any longer.In that understanding, our country welcomes the work being carried out by the OSCE to support the effective implementation of the Minsk agreements. It is important to emphasize that only through dialogue, direct negotiation and the political will of the parties will we be able to arrive at a peaceful and durable solution to the crisis in the region. We also believe that the application of unilateral coercive sanctions is incompatible with international law. Such sanctions are also counterproductive to hopes for achieving peace and stability in the region, given that they sour the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue that is so essential for rebuilding trust between the parties.With the support of the international community and by strictly complying with the Minsk agreements and the resolutions of the Security Council, it should be possible to avoid military escalation and the spreading of the conflict. All possible efforts must also be made to address the structural and historical root causes of the crisis, with the aim of achieving lasting and sustainable peace.We call upon the parties to strictly adhere to their obligations relating to the protection of civilians in the regions affected by violence, including the need to guarantee access for humanitarian assistance to residents in those areas, as well as to internally displaced persons and refugees who find themselves in the areas affected by the conflict. We reject acts of violence and ethnic and politically based persecution, as well as acts of terrorism, irrespective of who is behind them. Any such incident must be duly investigated independently, and the investigation must produce the evidence found to support the conclusions drawn.Finally, we call upon all parties to redouble their efforts in the quest for a just and lasting political solution, which is to their benefit and to that of the entire region.","We thank the Deputy Secretary-General, Mr. Šimonović, Mr. Ging and Mr. Apakan for their briefings.Angola supports the peaceful resolution of conflicts through dialogue, negotiations and strict respect for the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law. On this occasion, we want to reiterate our attachment to Ukraine’s unity, sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, as well as our support for the implementation of the package of measures adopted in Minsk on 12 February and for a permanent ceasefire a the prerequisite to the expeditious implementation of the Minsk agreements and, ultimately, to the establishment of peace in Ukraine.We took note of the relative optimism expressed by the briefers regarding the prevailing peaceful situation in eastern Ukraine, which we hope will strengthen and allow for the recovery of the region, thus enabling the population in those areas to enjoy a better life in peace and security. In that regard, we hope that the separatists in eastern Ukraine will soon give up the territories they control in order to restore normalcy to the lives of the people under their yoke and permit the restoration of the unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine.We regret the constraints on humanitarian access and the freedom of movement faced by United Nations agencies across the line of contact between Government- and non-Government-controlled areas because of security reasons. We strongly condemn violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. We call upon the parties to the conflict to allow and facilitate safe, rapid and unhindered access by humanitarian organizations to all areas and people in need.The situation of internally displaced persons is a matter of concern. Owing to inconsistent solutions for housing internally displaced persons, delays in winter protection, the significant number of landmines and unexploded ordnance remain the main causes of high casualty rates.The conflict in Ukraine is a senseless one. It must stop as soon as possible, with the Ukrainian people able to live in peace with one another. The Deputy Secretary-General referred to the Minsk agreements as the only viable strategy for the achievement of peace. We join our voice to his appeal for political will and flexibility, and we call on the parties to the conflict to respect the ceasefire, fully implement the Minsk package of measures and allow the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission freedom of movement to verify the ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the designated areas. The Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 2202 (2015), endorsing the Minsk agreements and conveying the international community’s commitment to peace in Ukraine.","I thank Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Ivan Šimonović, John Ging of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and Ambassador Apakan, Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, for their briefings.It has been 22 months since the Russian Federation began to take aggressive action against Ukraine. For nearly two years now, Ukraine has been suffering from a conflict initiated under false pretexts and supported by an aggressive campaign of propaganda and hate. The redrawing of Ukraine’s borders by force early in 2014 and the continued violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity remain a major challenge to the rules-based international system.Russia’s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine has already left over 9,000 dead, more than 20,000 injured, over 1.5 million uprooted from their homes within Ukraine and another 1 million forced to flee abroad. Five million people need humanitarian assistance. The approaching winter makes the lives of those in need even more difficult, yet by now this conflict barely makes it into the headlines. After a short lull earlier this autumn, the situation worsened again in November. It is evident that peace agreements will not be fully implemented in 2015. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission continues to register daily breaches of the ceasefire. Impunity, lawlessness and abuse continue to reign in the areas held by the illegal militants. Again last week, OSCE monitors were threatened with automatic rifles. Crimea — an integral part of Ukraine — remains occupied, in breach of the fundamental principles of international law, the Charter of the United Nations, the Budapest Memorandum and bilateral treaties. All this despite the fact that General Assembly resolution 68/262, on the territorial integrity of Ukraine, is very clear on the illegality of Crimea’s annexation and the sovereignty, political independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.As the end of the year approaches, there is a dangerously high probability that this crisis will become yet another of Europe’s so-called frozen conflicts. There are already too many of those. Five of the European Union’s six Eastern Partnership countries bordering on Russia are suffering from protracted conflicts. Russia continues to instigate separatism in Moldova. Violations of Georgia’s territorial integrity also continue unabated. The pattern could not be more obvious.The Minsk agreements may not be perfect, but they are all we have. Today there is simply no alternative. We support the diplomatic efforts undertaken in the Normandy format and in the Trilateral Contact Group under the auspices of the OSCE. At the same time, we remain critical of the recent trend towards the resequencing of commitments under the Minsk agreements and towards increasing the pressure on the political commitments of Ukraine, rather than on the security commitments of Russia and its militant proxies.Tangible peace can be achieved only through the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. That means full implementation by Russia, which is a party to the conflict and bears direct responsibility for its de-escalation. Russia must, inter alia, withdraw its arms, weapons, soldiers and mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine, cease its support for the illegal armed groups and allow Ukraine to restore full control over its international border. All hostages and illegally detained persons, including Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko, Oleg Sentsov and others, must be released.With regard to local elections, we remain concerned that, even if they are postponed to 2016, elections in the territories occupied by Russia’s militant proxies, with foreign soldiers present on the ground, will be neither free nor fair. It is up to the OSCE observers to ascertain whether conditions are ripe for holding elections and to assess their legitimacy. We have seen the results of Crimea’s gunpoint referendum. We do not want to see more of the same. All foreign weapons and foreign fighters must be withdrawn, preferably before the elections, to ensure that the voting is free and fair.The lack of effective protection for human rights in the areas under the control of Russia’s proxies has left people vulnerable to serious human rights abuses and violations, including, as was said in the briefings, killings, torture, degrading treatment, illegal detentions and forced labour. We need to continue to shine a light on the lawlessness and impunity in those areas, and we must work to ensure that the perpetrators will one day be brought to account. Therefore, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine should continue their much appreciated work and reporting. In addition, monitors from the United Nations, the OSCE, the Council of Europe and other organizations should be allowed into Crimea to investigate the increasingly restrictive environment and the curtailment of the rights of its residents, especially those of the indigenous Tatar community.Sanctions against the Russian Federation in response to its illegal annexation of Crimea and its deliberate destabilization of Ukraine should remain in force pending the full implementation of the Minsk agreements.The Council, too, has its responsibilities. It has unanimously backed the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements adopted in February, and must deliver on its promise to demand their full implementation. Importantly, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine cannot be allowed to fester or be forgotten just because we are facing other pressing needs — the need to address other urgent conflicts. We cannot close our eyes to the ongoing breach of the ideals, principles and rules of behaviour that have governed the Organization and governed the whole process and the entire international system for decades. Our failure to stand firmly for those values and principles will only embolden those willing to challenge the international order, thereby bringing about even more conflict, more instability, more human suffering.The international community needs to continue to support Ukraine on its path towards reforms, where significant progress has already been made. Ukraine and the Ukrainians have the right to create the future they want, free from coercion and gun-point pressure by their big neighbour.Lithuania reaffirms its support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity, with Crimea as an integral part of that country. In supporting Ukraine, we support our own freedom, independence and the right to live free from fear and in peace.","I would like to thank the briefers — Deputy Secretary-General Eliasson, Mr. Šimonović, Mr. John Ging and Ambassador Apakan — for their informative remarks.We have been following the developments in Ukraine very closely and are concerned by the tenuous peace prevailing in the country. In our view, the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements of February 2015 provide a concise and clear road map for settling the situation in Ukraine. That is why we urge the parties to abide by their obligations under the agreements in order to achieve the objectives of the ceasefire.Reports of indiscriminate shelling of populated areas are a matter of concern to us. That endangers the lives of civilians and exacerbates the humanitarian situation. We therefore urge the parties to take care not to expose civilians to unacceptable risks. Nigeria is also concerned about the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine. According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, many civilians in Donetsk and Luhansk continue to endure limited or no access to humanitarian assistance. We urge the authorities to remove the bureaucratic impediments to the work of humanitarian actors in order to facilitate the delivery of much-needed assistance. On the same subject, we applaud the efforts of the United Nations and other humanitarian actors to address the challenges in eastern Ukraine. We urge them to remain engaged in the situation until it stabilizes, and call on the authorities to take steps to ensure the establishment of an effective system for the adequate coordination of relief efforts in the region.","I would like to thank the Deputy Secretary-General, Mr. Jan Eliasson, the Chief Monitor of the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Mr. Ertuğrul Apakan, the Director of the Coordination and Response Division of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Mr. John Ging, and the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Mr. Ivan Šimonović, for their informative briefings.Jordan reiterates the need for a permanent political solution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine so as to establish peace and security there, as well as to restore its territorial integrity and sovereignty. Prolonging the conflict will not serve the interests of any of the parties. Moreover, the continuation and expansion of military confrontations and acts of provocation can lead only to the exacerbation of the current situation, while rendering the agreements devoid of all meaning. That will aggravate outstanding issues among the parties involved, leading to the deterioration of economic and humanitarian conditions, which will have even greater adverse effects on civilians in particular and on the security and stability of the region as a whole.Jordan calls upon all parties to assume their responsibilities and focus on positive and constructive dialogue within the framework of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group, in order to achieve a peaceful settlement of the crisis. The Minsk agreements and resolution 2202 (2015) provide a basic, solid foundation for any political settlement. The parties concerned should demonstrate sincerity and commitment to the implementation of those agreements and build upon them in order to achieve a ceasefire and settle the conflict. In that connection, we emphasize the need for the comprehensive implementation of all the terms of the agreements.We are deeply concerned about the continued breaches of the ceasefire and the fragile security conditions that have led to the humanitarian crisis in which thousands have been displaced, a further 9,000 people have lost their lives and more than 20,000 people have been injured. We emphasize that the political de-escalation of the Ukrainian crisis would help to resolve the humanitarian crisis. In any event, efforts to mitigate the crisis must be redoubled. It is imperative to protect civilians and their rights, to investigate all crimes and violations of those rights and to ensure the prevention of impunity.We reiterate the need to support the OSCE and to facilitate its work and access to all areas so that it can discharge its mission and verify the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the areas adjacent to the contact line. We also call upon the Government of Ukraine to proceed with the positive measures and reforms it is undertaking, including the recent adoption of the national human rights strategy. We emphasize the need to provide basic humanitarian and social services to civilians and to internally displaced persons in particular, regardless of the political affiliations of the parties to the conflict.","As we have mentioned on other occasions, it is once again a pleasure to see a woman presiding over the work of the Security Council, even though her presidency is coming to an end.We highly welcome the briefings by Mr. Jan Eliasson, Mr. Ging, Mr. Šimonović and Ambassador Apakan. We also welcome the participation and presence in the Council today of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Lithuania and Ukraine.We wish to express our profound misgivings in the light of the resurgence of tensions in various localities of Donetsk. In particular, we are tremendously worried about the failure to observe the ban on using heavy weapons — a point already raised by previous speakers. Faced with that reality, it is imperative and urgent to preserve the ceasefire.As we have indicated previously, we believe that full compliance with the ceasefire, to be monitored and verified by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, in line with the provisions of the Minsk agreements and the dialogue between the parties, is the only way to achieve lasting peace. We call upon the parties to refrain from actions incompatible with the Charter of the United Nations, international law and international humanitarian law.We are particularly troubled by the multifaceted fallout from the crisis and its impact on the civilian population, particularly in those areas under the control of illegal armed groups. We urge the parties to unconditionally respect human rights, including the rights of minorities, and to ensure that those responsible for such violations and abuses are brought to justice. Moreover, accountability is another way to support the implementation of the Minsk agreements.The humanitarian situation is an unavoidable issue. The situation of internally displaced persons and civilians in need of protection is of further concern. In that connection, we note in particular the elderly, as Mr. Ging mentioned today. Access for humanitarian assistance remains a core issue that must be guaranteed. The worsening weather conditions as winter sets in will seriously affect the population in need of assistance, especially children and other vulnerable groups. The international community must be ready to respond to relevant humanitarian appeals and to strengthen efforts to implement public health measures.This is a moment when it is crucial that the Council send a new message to the parties on the importance of creating the conditions that can enable the Minsk agreements to be effectively implemented. The facts show that apprehensions about the precariousness of the compliance may be justified in a context of structural tension. Only by ensuring a political dialogue within the Minsk framework can such cycles of violence be overcome.","I would like to thank the briefers — Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson, Mr. Ivan Šimonović, Mr. John Ging and Mr. Ertuğrul Apakan — for their presentations, and to welcome the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Lithuania and Ukraine to the Security Council.Chad is concerned about the continuing serious situation in eastern Ukraine despite the signing of the Minsk agreements on 12 February. The chief victims of the fighting and bombings are civilians. The humanitarian agencies’ statistics attest to the high human cost of the crisis in Ukraine, with more than 9,000 people dead and more than 2.5 million refugees and internally displaced persons, with thousands of the vulnerable having no access to humanitarian aid. Added to all that is the massive destruction of public and private infrastructure, never mind the enormous suffering that the affected civilians have endured.In the face of this worrying humanitarian situation, it is vital that we ensure free and unhindered access to the conflict zones in order to deliver essential humanitarian assistance to the internally displaced and improve their living conditions. Chad believes firmly that the solution to the Ukrainian crisis must be a political one, and as such is greatly dependent on the willingness of the parties concerned to commit to a genuine negotiation process aimed at achieving a lasting peace. In that regard, we call for implementation of the Minsk agreements, as laid down in resolution 2202 (2015), of 17 February, including a durable ceasefire, whose constant violation by the parties to the conflict we deplore. The withdrawal of heavy weapons and the observance of the agreements’ other relevant measures represent, among other things, ways to ease the violence. In that regard, the observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe should not be hindered in fulfilling their mission. Similarly, the implementation of the measures outlined must be carried out with respect for international norms, the recommendations in the reports of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and international law concerning the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.",,,,,,,,
S/PV.7498,29/07/2015,"Vote on draft resolution S/2015/562, which would establish an ad hoc criminal tribunal for the downing of MH-17 in 2014.","A year ago, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 crashed in eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people aboard. China is deeply saddened by that tragedy and wishes once again to express its sympathy to the bereaved families of the victims and to the countries concerned. We support, in accordance with resolution 2166 (2014), the holding of an objective, impartial and independent international investigation into the incident and the bringing of the perpetrators to justice. The current focus should be on establishing the truth behind the incident and seeking justice for the victims. China understands the feelings of the sponsors of the draft resolution and in particular those of the bereaved families of the victims of the crash of Flight MH-17, as well as their urgent desire that the perpetrators be punished. China participated in the consultations on the draft resolution and has all along called on the members of the Council to remain united and meet one another halfway, accommodate one another’s concerns and avoid political confrontation. If the Security Council could have achieved consensus on the next step to be taken concerning that incident, it would have sent out a positive signal to the effect that the international community was maintaining a common position on this issue. It would also have helped to establish the truth of the incident as soon as possible. Under circumstances in which some members of the Council still have major concerns about the draft resolution, to forcibly push forward a vote could only result in division among the States members of the Council. It will not help to ease the grief of the bereaved families of the victims of the crash of Flight MH-17, nor will it help to establish the facts or bring the perpetrators to justice. For these reasons, China abstained in the voting on the draft resolution. ","I wish to thank Malaysia and the co-authors of the draft resolution and to welcome the Ministers who are honouring us with their presence today. We deeply deplore the defeat of the draft resolution on the establishment of an international tribunal to prosecute persons responsible for the downing of Flight MH-17. France supported this major initiative from the beginning. The creation of the ad hoc tribunal formed a part of the fight against impunity, one of the Security Council’s priorities. Today we are once again witnessing the calling into question of one of the Council’s major areas of action, one that had until now found consensus among its members. The initiative was also part of the implementation of resolution 2166 (2014), adopted on 21 July 2014 by the Security Council, demanding that those responsible for the tragedy be held accountable for their actions. Resolution 2166 (2014) marked the unity of the Council in condemning that heinous act. It was also a milestone in clarifying the tragedy, finding those responsible and the demands of justice. The provisions of the draft resolution are by no means revoked by the fact that the draft was rejected today. Make no mistake, the call will continue for the whole truth behind this tragedy to be known, for those responsible to be prosecuted and for justice to be done. The Joint Investigation Team, with which the United Nations is associated through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and whose impartiality the United Nations recognizes, must continue its work. We owe it to the victims, who are vividly remembered. It is deeply shocking that one year after the disaster, in which, let us recall, 298 innocent civilians perished, the Council is unable to respond to the terrible anguish and concerns of entire nations, as evidenced by the presence here today of several Government representatives of the countries concerned. We therefore deeply regret Russia’s veto. Today’s vote represents a serious failure for the Council. We must take note of this, but we do not have the right to stop working. We owe it to each of the victims of this tragedy. We owe it to the quest for truth. And we owe it to the values of the United Nations, which must unite us. It is in that spirit that we will soon be called on to continue our work on the follow-up to the international inquiry, which will shortly submit its findings. ","We would like to begin by again extending our condolences to the families of the deceased, as well as to the Governments of the countries whose citizens were on board the flight that crashed in Ukraine on 17 July 2014. Russia has consistently advocated for a swift determination of the reasons for the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 and the bringing to justice of those responsible for the tragedy. Moreover, we have repeatedly contributed to the achievement of those objectives through concrete actions. The Russian delegation did everything in its power to ensure that the Security Council adopted resolution 2166 (2014) as soon as possible. In the course of its drafting, we insisted on including provisions with regard to the need for a comprehensive, thorough, independent international investigation under international civil aviation guidelines and with the International Civil Aviation Organization playing a leading role. Moreover, we were fully open to the immediate adoption of another draft resolution that would provide early access to the crash site to the joint investigation team. However, the States concerned chose to act outside the Council and on the basis of bilateral agreements with Ukraine, whose elaboration took additional time. In resolution 2166 (2014), we insisted on the inclusion in the text of provisions concerning the immediate cessation of all military activities in the area directly adjacent to the crash site. It was the Russian Federation that raised in the Security Council the issue of Kyiv’s violation of that provision in August, when the Ukrainian authorities unilaterally declared they would no longer adhere to the ceasefire agreement, as a result of which the joint investigation team was forced to suspend its work for a lengthy period. Within the framework of the technical investigation, pursuant to annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Russian experts transferred to the Dutch side all the information requested of us, including data from the Rostov radar station of the air traffic control system. A few days after the crash, the Russian Ministry of Defence held a briefing during which it released all Russian satellite data, which were also sent to the Dutch side. Analysis and calculations regarding one version of the catastrophe — that the flight was shot down by a surface-to-air Buk-type missile — were also sent to the Netherlands by experts of the Russian manufacturer Almaz-Antey. To that end, data concerning the technical characteristics of such missiles was declassified. Russia was the only country to make public such data. Unfortunately, a year after the adoption of resolution 2166 (2014), serious issues remain as to how the investigation has been conducted. Russian experts were not provided equal access to the various aspects of the technical investigation. They unilaterally provide their data and calculations, but remain unaware of what then happens to the information. We have repeatedly offered to provide qualified experts and equipment to carry out complicated work, for example, metallurgical analysis, which would have enabled us, by testing pieces of the wreckage, to determine the type of missile that brought down the plane. All that remains unanswered. Turning to criminal investigations, they are being carried out by members of the joint investigation team in a closed fashion. It was reported that an agreement had been reached by the five countries not to disclose information. Given this case, what grounds are there to be assured of the impartiality of this investigation? Can the investigation stand up to the backdrop of aggressive propaganda from the media? Can it withstand the pressure of an obvious political put-up job when the causes of the disaster and those responsible are announced in advance? Moreover, such statements are being made by a number of the leaders of States that make up the joint investigation team. The Russian Federation was the only country to point out that resolution 2166 (2014) provides for comprehensive United Nations assistance for the investigation. We offered to consider the creation of the post of a Special Representative of the Secretary- General, which would have helped to ensure a truly international and transparent investigation. However, our proposal was not accepted. Also not fulfilled was the instruction to the Secretary-General in that resolution to submit to the Security Council a comprehensive set of options for facilitating United Nations assistance for the investigation. What did we get instead? We got something that was summarily prepared outside the Security Council, without thoughtful consideration of the available options for a criminal investigation: a draft resolution under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. Our position that this was a premature, ill-defined and legally untenable step was not heeded. We have come up with an alternative draft resolution aimed at ensuring that we fully harnessed the potential of resolution 2166 (2014) and to ensure a genuine international, independent and comprehensive investigation. After reaching that goal, we could have revisited the issue legal mechanisms to bring perpetrators to justice. We would like to stress that our draft document remains on table. We believe that its proposals and ideas are still relevant. We have repeatedly stated that we do not support the idea of setting up a tribunal under Chapter VII of the Charter. There are no grounds for it, given that in resolution 2166 (2014) the Security Council did not classify the Boeing tragedy as a threat to international peace and security. It is difficult to explain how this event, which a year ago was not considered to be a threat to international peace and security, now suddenly becomes one. In principle, issues pertaining to organizing a criminal investigation do not fall under the remit of the Security Council. Well-known exceptions have been made owing to the need to determine those guilty for mass crimes deemed by the international community to be of the most serious nature. However, the experience with the Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the Tribunal for Rwanda can hardly be considered positive, given that they were very expensive, that they took a long time to carry out their work, that they were subject to political pressure, et cetera. No precedent in principle exists for the establishment by the Council of international tribunals to bring to justice those responsible for transportation disasters. This is something that has also happened in Russia, of course. In 2001, a Siberia Airlines flight was shot down over the Black Sea by Ukrainian anti-aircraft missiles. There was also the incident involving the Iran Air flight shot down over the Strait of Hormuz in 1988 by a missile fired from an American destroyer. National investigations were carried out at the time in Ukraine and in the United States, but no determination was made that a crime had been carried out. However, resolution 616 (1998), adopted following the deadly downing of the Iranian airliner, did not qualify the incident as a threat to international peace and security. Here is another example. In 2010, Russia proposed an initiative to set up a special international tribunal to prosecute pirates. We were prompted to do so by the unprecedented increase in the number of pirate attacks off the coast of Somalia. Effective mechanisms for the prosecution of pirates did not exist at the time; those apprehended at sea were often just released. The idea of an international tribunal for pirates did not enjoy support in the Security Council, despite the fact that the qualification of the situation as threatening international peace and security was quite clear. Arguments regarding the lack of efficiency, slowness and the unwieldiness of such mechanisms then emerged as the main arguments, especially from those who now support the draft resolution on the Boeing incident. We must therefore note that the draft resolution (S/2015/562) that was put to the vote today lacked any legal basis or precedent. We have repeatedly explained this to our colleagues and urged them to consider alternatives. However, the authors of the draft resolution have refused to act in a spirit of cooperation and put it to a vote, knowing that it would not lead to a positive outcome. In our view, this points to the fact that political aims were more important to them than practical objectives. This is regrettable. In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that Russia is ready to cooperate in the conduct of a full, independent and impartial investigation into the causes and circumstances of the crash of the Malaysian airliner, based on the provisions of resolution 2166 (2014) in order to identify and punish the perpetrators. The position that we have adopted today has nothing in common with promoting impunity. I shall be very brief. Today’s meeting was a very emotional one, which is understandable. At times it gave rise to the question: are there any limits to the political exploitation of the feelings of the families of those who perished and who are experiencing a living horror? A number of accusations were levelled at the Russian Federation that I consider insulting and not worthy of diplomats. Turning now to the substance of the issues, we made our arguments in our statement. I will touch on only one issue, on the outcome of the discussions. It is simply incomprehensible that a lack of understanding of one form of judicial proceedings is being equated with impunity. We made, and reaffirm, a proposal to consider various formats for judicial proceedings. Among them are simpler ones that are more effective, more appropriate and certainly less politicized; these are the ones on which we should focus. In his statement, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Mr. Klimkin, attempted to speak from a moral and religious position of superiority. He referred to the unacceptability of impunity and the need to cooperate. I have only two questions for him: why were civilian airliners sent to areas where military activities were under way, areas where the Ukrainian forces were fighting using military aircraft? Why were civilian flights sent through that airspace? The passengers on that airliner simply could not have known that a military conflict was under way there. Even Malaysian aviation authorities could not have known that a military conflict was under way there. But Kyiv knew it. Why did it do this? Why has it thus far not provided the recordings of its military air dispatchers? That is impunity. Did they punish anyone in Ukraine for that? Finally, the tragedy concerning Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 is a terrible event — not only for the citizens who died in that castrophe and the countries that they represented, but also for the diplomats who now are forced to deal with it. It is also a trial for the concerned politicians, experts and specialists who continue to work on this issue together. We need to walk hand-in-hand down on this road. Unfortunately, today’s meeting is most unlikely to promote joint movement towards the final objective, that is, to shed light on all of the circumstances surrounding this tragedy and to bring those responsible for it to justice. Russia is ready to resume this work at expert, diplomatic and any other levels. Let us therefore move forward from tomorrow- on in this effort. ","I would like to thank the Ministers of Malaysia, the Netherlands, Australia and Ukraine for marking this occasion with their presence. The United Kingdom is deeply saddened, frustrated and disappointed that Russia has vetoed draft resolution S/2015/562 today. The draft resolution was about securing justice for the 298 people — including 80 children and 10 British nationals — who lost their lives on board Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. Russia’s veto disrespects the victims and insults their families. Through resolution 2166 (2014), the Security Council unanimously agreed that those responsible for that incident be held to account and demanded that all States cooperate fully with efforts to establish accountability. With its veto, Russia is not meeting that demand. The Security Council had an opportunity today to start a process that would have brought justice and accountability for the families of all those who lost their lives. There are clear precedents for the Council taking this kind of action: securing international support for the Lockerby trial, and establishing the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and another Special Tribune for Lebanon, among others. A year after the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, this was precisely the moment to establish a tribunal — to send a clear and unambiguous message that the Council will not tolerate impunity and that the Council has a clear responsibility to address violent acts that constitute a threat to international peace and security. We therefore reject the Russian allegation that this draft resolution was an unnecessary and premature move, and that the Security Council should have waited for the investigations to conclude. An operational and fully staffed tribunal takes time to set up. Had we started that process today, the tribunal would have been ideally placed to act on the outcome of the investigations. Despite Russia’s veto, the investigations will continue. The investigators have been exemplary in their professionalism and integrity, working in the most challenging circumstances. We reject any allegations to the contrary. Russia has been involved in both investigations. The Russian Federal Transport Agency has actively participated in the technical investigation and contributed material to the criminal investigation. It is damaging that Russia has chosen to block the best route to establishing a tribunal for that criminal investigation to reach a conclusion. It is through those investigations that we will bring those responsible to account — as resolution 2166 (2014) demands. The veto today will not prevent that. The perpetrators of that terrible crime should find no comfort in Russia’s actions today. There must be accountability, and the international community now needs to unite to make that happen. Allow me to conclude by returning to the victims. To them, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 was meant to be a routine flight to Kuala Lumpur: a business trip, a holiday or a stop-over before a conference. Instead, all 298 people on board lost their lives in a remote part of eastern Ukraine — far from home, far from those they loved and far from those who loved them. They and those whom they left behind deserve justice. Despite Russia’s actions today, we will not give up in our pursuit of that goal. ","I thank all the Ministers who have travelled to New York for this important meeting. Shuba Jaya and her husband Paul Goes were flying back home from the Netherlands, where they had brought their one-year-old daughter, Kaela, to meet Paul’s parents for the first time. Nick Norris was bringing his three grandkids, Mo, age 12, Evie, age 10, and Otis, age 8, back to Perth from a family vacation, so that the children’s parents could have a few days of holiday to themselves. Tambi Jiee and Ariza Gazalee were moving back to Malaysia after more than two years of living abroad. With them were their sons, Muhammad Afif, age 19, Muhammad Afzal, age 17, and Mohammed Afruz, age 13, and their daughter, Marsha Azmeena, age 15. All of these families were on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. All of them are gone. Among the 298 people on board were students and teachers, florists and flight attendants, entrepreneurs and restaurateurs, an aerospace engineer and a supermarket cashier. Some 80 of the passengers were children. Their loss is immeasurable. The loss is felt by generations of students of 72-year-old Sister Philomene Tiernan, a member of the Society of the Sacred Heart, a religious order devoted primarily to advancing girls’ education. Sister Phil, as her students knew her, was returning home after visiting the church in France where the remains of the religious order’s founder are buried. The loss is felt among people who may never have met the victims but whose lives were touched and at times permanently altered by their work. I am speaking of victims like Joep Lange and his partner, Jacqueline van Tongeren, who were among the passengers headed to the twentieth International AIDS Conference. Joep was a renowned researcher who helped make antiretroviral treatments cheaper for people who otherwise could not afford them. Jacqueline worked for an non-governmental organization that promotes health solutions for poor communities. I am speaking of victims like Willem Witteveen who was not only a deeply respected scholar of the law and political theory but also a dedicated public servant, having served for nearly a decade as a Dutch senator. But the loss of the 298 individuals is of course felt most profoundly by their families. Dora Shahila Kassim was the lead flight attendant and a single mother. She had worked hard to ensure that her 16-year-old daughter, Diyana, had every opportunity. “She was not just my mother but my father, my best friend,” Diyana said. “I do not know how I am going to live without her.” Silene and Rob Fredriksz’s son, Bryce Fredriksz, age 23, was on the flight with his girlfriend, Daisy Oehlers, age 20. The young couple lived with Bryce’s parents. Since 17 July 2014, Bryce’s parents have left the room just as Bryce and Daisy left it, with the bed unmade and clothes strewn around the floor. Silene cannot bring herself to touch it. The space, she said, still breathes Bryce and Daisy. This could have happened to any of our families. Our sons or daughters, our mothers or fathers, our grandparents or aunts and uncles — any of the them could have been on that flight. So could our teachers, our colleagues, our neighbours, our best friends. The passengers on that flight came from 18 nations, including my own, but they could have come from any of our countries. In that way, the families of the 298 passengers and the communities and nations they belonged to are all of our families. The United States believes firmly that those who carried out this unspeakable crime cannot remain unnamed and unpunished. When the Netherlands, Malaysia, Australia, Belgium and Ukraine put forward draft resolution S/2015/562, we supported their efforts. Of course, justice by itself will not fill the profound void left behind with the loss of those on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. But efforts to deny justice only intensify the pain of the victims’ families who have already endured more than any of us can fathom. That was the effect when Russian-backed separatists prevented investigators from gaining full and timely access to the crash site. It was the effect of Russia’s refusal even to negotiate today’s draft resolution and statute, essentially preventing any meaningful negotiation of those texts from taking place. It is the effect of Russia’s veto today. By vetoing today’s draft resolution, Russia has tried to deny justice to the 298 victims on that plane and deny their families a chance to hold accountable those responsible. Russia has callously disregarded the public outcry in the grieving nations and the appeals of the families affected. It is tragic that Russia has used the privilege entrusted to it to advance international peace and security for the purposes of frustrating international peace and security. But let us be clear — today’s veto cannot and will not deny the victims and their families justice. There cannot and will not be impunity for those who downed a civil airliner with 298 people aboard. When justice is denied for those 298 individuals and their families and their communities, it is denied for all of our families, communities and nations. While we are outraged and gravely disappointed by the outcome of this vote, today we say to those families that no veto will stand in the way of this heinous crime being investigated and prosecuted and that no veto will weaken our unshakeable commitment to them to ensure that they and their loved ones have the justice they deserve. ",,,,,,,,,,,"I take this opportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your effective presidency of the Council for this month. I would like to thank the delegation of Malaysia for requesting the convening of this meeting, and all members of the Security Council and the grieving nations for their strong support for the idea of establishing an international criminal tribunal to hold to account those responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17.It is obvious that these historic times will always be remembered, not only because of the number of vetoes exercised by the Russian Federation, but mainly because of the spirit of unity among the countries participating in the joint investigation team and all who support us in our efforts to deliver justice. A year ago, the Ukrainian people took the downing of Flight MH-17 as a national tragedy, and it will always remain so in our hearts. I still remember the sea of flowers in front of the Dutch and Malaysian embassies, and the hundreds of Ukrainians who gathered around those buildings during the night. I will never forget it.When we heard about this incident, at the very beginning we had some hope that lives might be saved and immediately provided all available resources to the rescue teams. Then we did everything possible to prevent looting and to secure access for the investigators to the areas controlled by the terrorists. Now, our duty to those who died and the families of the victims is to bring to justice those who committed this barbaric act. We, more than anyone, feel the pain of the victims; that is why we want the truth about this crime to emerge. More than anyone, we want the perpetrators to be arraigned and tried by a public international court. There can be no reason to oppose that, unless you are a perpetrator yourself.I could not agree more with my friends and colleagues, including several Government ministers who have spoken today, but I would like to make several points crystal clear. Resolution 2166 (2014) established an obligation for States to cooperate fully in the course of the investigation of this tragedy and to bring those responsible to justice. The use of a sophisticated and powerful weapon against a civilian aircraft constitutes a threat to international civil aviation and to international peace and security in general. The only effective way to prevent such acts in the future is to punish those responsible without delay. It is indeed an issue for the Security Council to deal with under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.The level of support enjoyed by our draft resolution has clearly risen, showing that we are on right track. Our aim here is to create an effective, transparent, unbiased and independent vehicle to bring to justice those responsible for the crime. It is about the individual criminal responsibility of the murderers, and it is not about politics. That is why it is particularly disappointing that one country — Russia, to be precise — still mixes two completely separate issues: its responsibility for aggression against Ukraine and its continuous support for terrorism, on the one hand, and the individual responsibility of the perpetrators of the tragedy, on the other. There is no other explanation for today’s veto by Russia.The role of Russia in the conflict is absolutely clear and well known. Thousands of Russian soldiers and mercenaries and tanks and every type of heavy weaponry have been delivered across the border; that is simply impossible to hide. Just recently, another Russian truck full of weapons and ammunition was captured in Ukraine. The driver is once again a Special Forces officer. But this story is a matter for international mechanisms.When I look at the Russian delegation today, I feel pity. It dared to dampen the aspirations of the entire world, especially those of the families of the victims. It has aligned itself with the thugs who committed this atrocious crime. But our hope for justice is not lost. The Russian Federation just killed draft resolution S/2015/562, but that abuse of the veto power will not kill the hope of those who suffered or their love for loved ones and their relatives. It will only make all of us stronger and more determined and more committed to elaborating and implementing an effective and credible prosecution model to deliver justice.I am reminded of a line from Shakespeare about captive good attending captain ill; let us stop attending captain ill — it is just not worth it. In the face of truth, humanity and God, if one still believes in God, the tribunal in question is about 298 innocent lives. It is about the truth. He who is afraid of truth is definitely on the wrong side of the issue. He who is afraid of truth is alone here in the Security Council. “If you know the truth, the truth will set you free.” These are not my words. They are from the Holy Gospel. They come from a higher authority.","I too would like to express Germany’s gratitude to Malaysia and the members of the Joint Investigation Team for introducing the draft resolution before us today (S/2015/562), as well as to the Kingdom of the Netherlands for leading the investigation into the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 tragedy.We deeply regret that the Council’s unequivocal commitment to accountability and justice was vetoed today. A year ago, with the adoption of resolution 2166 (2014), the Council called for a thorough investigation of the downing of Flight MH-17 and demanded that those responsible be held accountable. With that resolution, the Council took on the responsibility of bringing the perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice. Today, it failed in that responsibility. As one of the grieving nations, Germany will do everything in its power to ensure that justice takes its course and accountability is achieved. Establishing an international tribunal on the basis of a Security Council resolution would have represented a significant step to that end, which was why Germany sponsored today’s draft resolution, which unfortunately failed to find the Council’s approval.As we speak, the unbearable situation that led to the tragic downing of Flight MH-17 and the loss of so many innocent lives continues. Every day, people in eastern Ukraine are killed or wounded or lose their homes as a direct consequence of the conflict. That has to stop. We call for an immediate and lasting de-escalation of the conflict in order to prevent more tragedies from happening, and we urge all sides to fully implement the Minsk agreements. All of us, but particularly Ukraine and its neighbour Russia, have a profound interest in stabilizing the situation in eastern Ukraine. Germany, together with France, Ukraine and Russia — in the Normandy format and with other partners — has been working hard to end the conflict and find a solution. As we have all seen in the long negotiations on nuclear issues with Iran, in which we also cooperated closely with the Russian Federation and the other permanent members of the Security Council, solutions are possible when all sides approach the issues at hand in a constructive manner.Today the Council has utterly failed the victims, families and friends of the passengers and crew members killed, among them four German citizens. That does not mean that the perpetrators can triumph and hope for impunity. We, the grieving nations, supported by many others, will not rest until they are held accountable. We sincerely hope, and to that end we call on all members of the Council and all parties concerned, that we can ensure that the Council will find another way to live up to its responsibilities and bring the perpetrators to justice. We owe it to the victims and to all who were close to them.",,,"I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting on the subject of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, which is of great importance to us. My delegation also thanks Malaysia for initiating the proposal on that issue. It has been one year since the deeply troubling downing of Flight MH-17. But the pain and sorrow at the deaths of all those who perished in this most inhumane event, who included Indonesians, has not diminished.It is deeply regrettable that the Council has failed to unite in taking measures to address the issues related to the downing of Flight MH-17. Indonesia, and, I believe, all other grieving nations owe it to the victims of this tragedy and their families to take effective measures. There must be appropriate measures to hold those responsible accountable, and there should also be clear measures to prevent similar incidents from ever happening again. This includes ensuring the observance of international law, particularly relevant international humanitarian law, greater international cooperation; and an unequivocal combined stand that such incidents will not be tolerated.Indonesia reiterates its support for resolution 2166 (2014) and urges the Council to fulfil its commitment and responsibility to take all follow-up measures to fully implement the resolution, including to bring those responsible for the downing of MH-17 to justice. Several countries have worked together in the past year to provide clarity to those affected by the tragedy. In this regard, Indonesia welcomes the investigation process, including the efforts undertaken by the Joint Investigation Team. My delegation underscores the importance of a comprehensive, thorough and independent investigation, with an emphasis on transparency and impartiality, which should serve as the basis for establishing accountability.Finally, my delegation calls upon the Council to continue its work to forge consensus on all appropriate measures to that end.",,"After the vote on draft resolution S/2015/562 introduced by Malaysia and sponsored by many other countries affected, including mine, by the grief of their citizens, as well as by several members of the Security Council, I wish first of all to express our solidarity with Australia, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine, our partners in the Joint Investigation Team. Our judicial authorities are making every effort to shed light on the circumstances of the destruction of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 and ensure that justice is rendered to the families and next of kin of the victims of this tragedy.What we were proposing today to the Council, the establishment of an international tribunal, would have made it possible to reach this objective. Despite the solid legal grounds on which the proposal was based and the broad support it enjoyed, it was not possible to reach an agreement on it within the Security Council, which we can only regret. We must remain committed so that justice can be done, for this is our responsibility towards the victims and their next of kin. This responsibility is shared by our five countries and by the other grieving nations as well as by all countries which, like us, consider that impunity not only is unacceptable, but could also have disastrous consequences for international peace and security.We are ready to move forward and intensify our contacts and démarches in order to make a reality of what resolution 2166 (2014) asking of us — that all States associate fully with the efforts undertaken to assign responsibility. This has to be done in full respect of the law, which is essential for the victims and their families and friends, and without falling into the trap of any kind of politicization.We commend the progress achieved by the international air safety investigation carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the International Civil Aviation Organization. The Joint Investigation Team, in which the Belgian judicial authorities participate, is pursuing its inquiry in a totally independent and objective way, in cooperation with all interested parties. We must ensure that this essential work has a judicial follow-up that will meet the expectations of the families and next of kin of the victims, in a timely manner, so that impunity will not prevail over the rule of law and human dignity.",,,,"At the outset, I would like like to thank the Ministers, who came from far away to attend this important meeting.One year has passed since the tragedy of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, which caused the loss of the lives of 298 passengers and crew members, among whom were a Vietnamese family of three. Viet Nam is grateful for the effective cooperation in the recovery and repatriation of the victims as well as the support for their families. We appreciate all of the efforts made by the relevant parties to investigate this incident, including the efforts by the Joint Investigation Team, and we take note of the preliminary report.Viet Nam once again reiterates our request for a continued independent, objective and transparent investigation, in line with resolution 2166 (2014). We call upon all relevant parties to fully cooperate in the investigation. We are of the view that the perpetrators must be brought to justice through appropriate mechanisms, in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations.Viet Nam stands ready to work closely with all of the parties concerned in our efforts to adequately address this incident.",,,,,,,,,"I appreciate the opportunity to speak here today on behalf of the Netherlands and the Dutch people. Today we recall the tragedy of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, which occurred a little over a year ago. We mourn all 298 men, women and children on board on that flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Today is also the day that the pursuit of justice is called for.On the 17 July, at the memorial service organized by the families of the victims, I saw once again how deeply this tragedy has wounded so many people in the Netherlands and in many other grieving nations. One hundred and ninety-six Dutch citizens were killed. Innocent men, women and many children. Many more families and friends were left behind in despair and are wondering why. Why them? Their wish, their desire, is for justice to be done: a cry for accountability, a cry for this important organ to act.In response to the incident, the Security Council adopted the crucial resolution 2166 (2014), which condemns the downing of Flight MH-17 — which resulted in the terrible loss of so many lives — calls upon all the parties involved to facilitate recovery and repatriation and demands that those responsible be held to account. The resolution created hope for those who lost loved ones. My country has abided by the resolution. We set out a three-step approach in close cooperation with other affected countries. That approach includes, first, repatriation and identification of the victims; secondly, a thorough and independent investigation into the cause of the crash; and, thirdly, justice for the victims and for those responsible.The Netherlands has regularly and thoroughly informed the Security Council of the progress made on those three steps. First, all but two victims — both Dutch citizens — have been identified and repatriated. Secondly, the technical investigations into the cause of the crash are nearly complete, and the completely independent Dutch Safety Board is expected to release its final report in October. And, thirdly, the criminal investigation being carried out by the joint investigation team set up by Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine is at a very advanced stage.That brings us to our ultimate task, namely, holding to account those directly or indirectly responsible for the downing of Flight MH-17. Bringing them to justice is not only our duty to the victims of this tragedy; the Council’s important resolution 2166 (2014) demands it. In that resolution, the Council acknowledged its authority and responsibility to see this matter through to its logical conclusion in the following ways: by reaffirming the international legal prohibition of acts of violence that pose a threat to international civil aviation; by calling on all States to cooperate fully with the international investigation of the incident; by demanding that, as called for in the resolution 2166 (2014), those responsible for this incident be held to account and that all States cooperate fully with efforts to establish accountability. That imposes an international obligation to prosecute the perpetrators.Let me ask the following question. When the Council called upon all States to act in that way, did the Council not assume that it too had a responsibility? After all, this is the highest political institution representing the international community. When the Council decided to remain actively seized of the matter, did it not foresee a role for itself in guaranteeing compliance with the resolution by all States Members of the United Nations in the interests of all those who lost their lives that afternoon above the skies of the Ukraine?On behalf of the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium and Ukraine, Malaysia presented to the Council a thorough and carefully drafted proposal for an international criminal tribunal, to be established under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. Our purpose is to create a timely, depoliticized and credible mechanism to ensure that the perpetrators face justice and are held to account.We came to the Council with a desire to see justice done in the most effective, impartial and legitimate way, with the greatest possible chance of success. I would like to thank those Council members who have supported the Malaysian draft resolution and believe that this terrible crime deserves the attention of the Security Council and the best possible prosecution mechanism at our disposal. I express my deep disappointment that Russia has used its veto to stop the Council from actively ensuring that justice is served. My thoughts go out to the families of the victims who had placed their hope on the resolve of the Council to set up this tribunal.We listened carefully to the arguments and concerns Russia voiced. We engaged and answered all — and I underline — all its questions. We made very clear that this is the best way forward, giving the demand for accountability by the Security Council itself. The accountability process is duly under way and in line with international standards. It makes no sense at all for the Council to stop it here. As said, the Dutch Safety Board has finished the investigation into the cause, and will publish its report in October. The criminal investigation is well under way, now we should have acted in order to be ready for the follow-up.We have made the case for a prosecution mechanism that transcends politics. The idea to establish a tribunal now was born to ensure an independent and depoliticized procedure, before the results of the investigations would point at certain possible perpetrators. I find it incomprehensible that a member of the Security Council obstructs justice in a tragedy that has affected so many. Impunity will send a very dangerous signal and will threaten the safety of civil aviation — the safety of all of us, the safety of Council members.We, the countries working together on the criminal investigation, will not stop in our endeavour to ensure that those responsible for this violent act are held accountable. We have the support of many in this Chamber and many more outside. My country will not rest until all the facts are known and justice has been been served. We expect the world community to continue to cooperate with us in our efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice, in accordance with resolution 2166 (2014). The Netherlands, Malaysia, Australia, Belgium and Ukraine will continue to work together to find the best way of prosecuting those responsible. We will continue working together to ensure justice is served, and we will lose no time in pursuing this.",,,,,,,"Spain voted today in favour of draft resolution S/2015/562, presented by Malaysia, and we regret that it could not be adopted. My delegation believes that the draft resolution was an appropriate follow-up to resolution 2166 (2014), which the Council adopted unanimously a year ago. It is important to highlight the fact that resolution 2166 (2014) remains in force today. It is also important to preserve the unity that the Council demonstrated at that time.In that context, I wish to reiterate Spain’s condemnation of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 last July as well as our sorrow at the fate of its 298 civilian passengers and crew, to whose memory I wish to pay tribute once again today.My country has repeatedly called for accountability of those responsible for this indescribable act. It is unacceptable that the parties to a conflict could resort to indiscriminate violent attacks against civil aviation. The Security Council cannot remain unmoved in the face of this kind of action. On the contrary, it must ensure that those responsible are brought to account, as set out in its resolution 2166 (2014).I wish to reiterate Spain’s firm support both for the technical investigation of the events directed by the Dutch Safety Board in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) principles, as well as for the criminal investigation being carried out by the Joint Investigation Team. I wish also to acknowledge and give thanks for the role that the United Nations system, in particular ICAO, has been playing, in a rigorous and independent manner, in support of the technical investigation.As we have previously stated, Spain believes that the creation of an ad hoc international criminal tribunal, as detailed in the Malaysian draft resolution, would be a step forward in the fight against impunity and the quest for justice for the victims. It is important to continue to work to attain this objective and to convey the message that such execrable acts are unacceptable. We have a responsibility to contribute through our actions to the prevention of further such acts, especially because more and more non-State actors are able to do so today. In this way we will contribute to strengthening the safety of international aviation and, ultimately, international peace and security.","I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the Minister for Foreign Affairs for New Zealand.Today, the Council has been asked to remember the tragic events of 17 July 2014 in which 298 people were killed, including one New Zealand citizen and one resident. One year ago, the Council adopted unanimously resolution 2166 (2014), which condems the attack and calls for those responsible to be held to account. Today’s draft resolution S/2015/562 sought to establish a mechanism by which that accountability could be sought. The fact that we have not preserved the unanimity that characterized resolution 2166 (2014) is deeply disappointing.In failing to find a way forward, the Council has let down the families and friends of those killed on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, and has let itself down as well. This is a matter on which the Council should have been able to agree. For the Security Council, charged with upholding international peace and security, not to be able to agree on an accountability process when a commercial airliner was brought down and 298 people were killed is indeed a serious indictment. This does not appear to me to be a matter that can be seen in shades of grey: either we follow a path of accountability or there is impunity. I very much regret that the latter was the result of the Council vote today.As President of the Council, we worked hard to promote a consensus outcome. However, the positions on the establishment of a tribunal at this time were not reconcilable. That this outcome has been achieved by the use of the veto is a matter of special regret to my country. New Zealand has opposed the veto consistently since 1945, and we oppose its use today. We as a Council simply have to find better ways of working together.The countries that suffered heavy losses, including in particular Australia, Malaysia and the Netherlands, are our close friends. New Zealand supported and co-sponsored the draft resolution for an international tribunal as a serious effort to establish accountability for the downing of Flight MH-l7. That is the least we can do to honour the victims and alleviate the grieving of their families.I conclude by conveying the condolences of my Government and country to the families and friends of the victims of Flight MH-17 and our strong regret that the Council was unable to meet its obligations to them today.I resume my functions as President of the Council.I give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Albert Koenders, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.","Draft resolution
S/2015/562 before the Council today is being introduced
by Malaysia on behalf of the countries participating in
the joint investigation team on the downing of Malaysia
Airlines Flight MH-17: Australia, Belgium, Malaysia,
the Netherlands and Ukraine. It is on their behalf, as
well as on behalf of my own delegation, that I take the
floor to explain our position.
A year ago, on 17 July 2014, the international
community was shocked by the tragic downing of the
civilian Flight MH-17 in eastern Ukraine. The Council
was united in its immediate reaction by adopting
resolution 2166 (2014) by consensus a few days later.
That resolution condemned the incident; called
for a full, thorough and independent international
investigation, in accordance with international civil
aviation guidelines; called on all States and actors to
cooperate fully with the international investigation; and
demanded that those responsible be held to account and
that all States cooperate fully with efforts to establish
accountability.
Since then, an independent air safety investigation
has been conducted in full compliance with annex
13 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation
and the guidelines of the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO). The Dutch Safety Board has led
the air safety investigation ever since the investigation
was transferred by the State of occurrence, that is
Ukraine, to the Netherlands. The investigation has been
assisted by experts from various countries, including
Australia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, the
Russian Federation, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and
the United States of America.
Alongside but separate from the air safety
investigation, the law enforcement agencies of Australia,
Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine
have been cooperating in a joint investigation team to
undertake a criminal investigation into the downing of
Flight MH-17. The investigation has been undertaken to
implement the Council’s call in resolution 2166 (2014)
for a full, thorough and independent investigation
into the incident. The United Nations has expressed
confidence that the investigation is being carried out in
line with international standards.
On the first anniversary of the downing of Flight
MH-17, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon welcomed
the progress made by the independent international
investigation, in accordance with resolution 2166
(2014). ICAO has also expressed its support for the
ongoing independent international investigation.
A year ago, the Council demanded accountability
in resolution 2166 (2014). It is now timely for the
Council to take clear and decisive action to demonstrate
its political will and determination to pursue the cause
of accountability for the senseless killing of those on
board Flight MH-17. That is why today, on behalf of the countries participating in the joint investigation team — Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine — Malaysia is requesting the Council to take action on the draft resolution to establish an ad hoc international criminal tribunal.It is important for the Security Council to take clear and decisive action under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations against those responsible for the downing of flight MH-17, and to send a very clear message to the growing number of non-State actors with the ability to target civilian aircraft that such attacks are unacceptable. Thus, the establishment of an international tribunal by the Council would send a clear message that the international community is committed to taking action against those who threaten international peace and security by endangering civil aviation. All those who travel by air will be more at risk if perpetrators are not held to account.An international tribunal would also be best placed to deliver justice to the families of all victims. The creation of an obligation to cooperate with the proposed tribunal would also maximize the prospects for securing international cooperation with the tribunal. The establishment of a tribunal prior to the completion of the criminal investigation would also ensure that this establishment is as depoliticized as possible and consistent with the Security Council’s own practice in relation to other ad hoc criminal courts and tribunals. Regardless of who the perpetrators are, we want to ensure that the arm of justice will reach them and that there will be no impunity. Moreover, the draft statute of the tribunal, which is annexed to the draft resolution, would ensure the independence of the judges and the prosecutor and provide full power to the prosecutor to carry out his or her own investigation.Malaysia, which is one of the countries participating in the joint investigation team, has been engaging with all Council members to seek support for the draft resolution. We have held consultations on the draft resolution and the statute within the Council and engaged in extensive outreach efforts, both in New York and in capitals, to explain our initiative, address possible concerns and seek the support of Council members and the grieving nations. We would like to thank all those who have supported our efforts and sponsored the draft resolution today.As we submit the draft resolution to the vote, I wish to appeal to all Council members to bear in mind the calls for justice and accountability issued by the victims’ families and loved ones, as well as the Council’s promise to ensure accountability in resolution 2166 (2014). We must send a clear signal against impunity. The families and loved ones of the victims of the downing of Flight MH-17 will expect no less from us. We ask the Council to support our initiative. Words cannot express how deeply the families of the passengers and crew involved have been affected by these events. Our hope is that they will find some comfort not only in the united support we will have demonstrated here in the Security Council, but more importantly in the action taken by the Council on the draft resolution.For these reasons, Malaysia will vote in favour of draft resolution S/2015/562. We urge all Council members to do the same. Malaysia deeply regrets the failure of the Security Council to maintain unity on the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. We are deeply disappointed at the failure to adopt draft resolution S/2015/562, which would have established an ad hoc criminal tribunal for MH-17, despite our persistent efforts to address Council members’ concerns and to bridge our differences. Malaysia, together with the countries participating in the joint investigation team, had wanted to pursue this option because it would have generated broad international support for the prosecution process. It was also the best way to ensure the cooperation of all nations with an effective prosecution mechanism to ensure justice and accountability.Unfortunately, one year since the unanimous adoption of resolution 2166 (2014), the Council is now taking a step backwards by sending the wrong signal to the victims’ families and loved ones. The Council has also failed to implement resolution 2166 (2014), which demands that those responsible be held to account and that all States cooperate fully with efforts to establish accountability. Instead of conveying a message in support of justice and accountability, we are sending a dangerous message of impunity for the perpetrators of this heinous crime, as well as jeopardizing the safety of civil aviation over conflict zones in the future.I wish to stress that Malaysia will not be deterred by today’s unfortunate event. We will remain steadfast in our determination to pursue accountability for the perpetrators and to ensure justice for all the innocent victims on board the ill-fated plane. I wish to sincerely thank all the countries that have supported Malaysia and those participating in the joint investigation team in our endeavour to establish an international criminal tribunal for Flight MH-17.Moving forward, we will continue with our outreach efforts and consultations with the relevant countries to address any concerns that they may have in the pursuit of justice and accountability for Flight MH-17. Malaysia will also consider and explore other viable options and prosecuting mechanisms in view of today’s setback. Council members may rest assured that we will not stop here and that we will never give up. We have to do something; doing nothing is not an option, and we must now move forward with a renewed sense of purpose in order to ensure that we are able to demand justice. We owe it to the families and loved ones of the victims to soldier on in our quest for justice and accountability.","Venezuela rejects the reprehensible act that led to the downing of civilian Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in the region of Donetsk, Ukraine, where 298 crew members and passengers perished. We reiterate our solidarity with the families and countries of the victims affected by that regrettable incident, which took place a year ago. We are convinced that, in the framework of combating impunity, justice must prevail in order that those responsible for this tragedy be punished in accordance with the law.Nevertheless, Venezuela abstained in the voting on draft resolution S/2015/562 because it introduced fractious political elements that could impact the necessary cooperation and trust between the parties in the ongoing investigation, which needs to determine what happened in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. That needs to be done in order to determine the necessary criminal responsibility to bring to justice those responsible for that reprehensible act. We believe that the reference in the draft resolution to Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations goes beyond the political and legal framework set out in resolution 2166 (2014) — which established the objective of determining the path to take in adopting the relevant measures on this issue within the Security Council.The description of this incident as a threat to international peace and security is untimely and politicizes the handling of this case, which is in the technical phase of investigation — making it a criminal matter. On that basis, we believe that the Security Council does not have the competence to establish an ad hoc international criminal tribunal.In no circumstances would we like to see to see this deplorable incident and the suffering of the victims be politically used as part of the conflict affecting this region of Ukraine. Our country condemns this attack against civil aviation. Such acts are inadmissible and must not go unpunished. On this ocassion, we would like to recall the highjacking of the Cubana de Aviación flight in 1966, which resulted in deaths of 73 innocent civilians. The perpetrators of that heinous act still enjoy impunity.We must bear in mind that, through resolution 2166 (2014), it was agreed to conduct a technical investigation of the incident. The investigation was to be independent, transparent and impartial — following the procedures and standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization. The resolution also called for the full cooperation of all the parties concerned. The investigation into the causes and the search for the perpetrators continues. We believe that such efforts to obtain facts and the truth must continue. We therefore believe we should encourage efforts to that end in order to arrive at the facts. Let us not prejudge or reach conclusions that are unfounded. We must avoid the politicization of this affair within the Security Council and continue with the investigations, which we hope will produce results enabling us to determine the causes of this deplorable incident and the responsibility for it — with the cooperation of this organ. Venezuela is fully prepared to contribute in any way to clarifying this painful event.","Angola abstained in the voting on today’s draft resolution S/2015/562, introduced by Malaysia, on the establishment of an international tribunal for prosecution of those responsible for crimes connected with the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17.At the outset, let me be clear. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH- 17 over Donetsk, Ukrain, on 17 July 2014 — a tragic event that resulted in the loss of all 298 passengers and crew members on board. We emphasize the need and importance of holding accountable those responsible for those acts in order to establish justice for the victims and their families, to set an example that acts like those can be punished, and to protect civil aviation from such intolerable deeds.Nevertheless, we are convinced that resolution 2166 (2014) continues to be the applicable legal framework for international cooperation in the interests of a full, true, definitive and transparent investigation into the incident in accordance with international civil aviation guidelines. As the criminal international investigation is yet not complete, we are of the view that, at this stage, Member States should be engaged in a comprehensive process of consultations. The Security Council resolution 2166 (2014) stipulates that the Secretary-General should identify possible options for United Nations support to the investigation and report to the Council on the relevant developments.We are therefore convinced that the establishment of a criminal tribunal is a premature solution and that the most appropriate mode of action would be to wait for the results of the investigation. We regret that once again the Council was not able to reach the required level of compromise for the consensus needed in a text acceptable to all members.","I welcome you, Mr. President, Minister Liow Tiong Lai of Malaysia, Minister Bishop of Australia, Minister Klimkin of Ukraine, and Minister Koenders of the Netherlands to the Security Council. Their presence here is a testament to the commitment of their Governments to seek accountability and justice for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 near Torez, Donetsk oblast, on 17 July 2014.Our deepest sympathies go to the families of the victims in the Netherlands, Malaysia, Australia, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, the Philippines, New Zealand and Canada. Words may soothe the grieving families, but the heinous crime that was committed calls for an answer from the Security Council. It needs all States to cooperate fully in establishing accountability, which is what was precisely demanded by resolution 2166 (2014) unanimously adopted by the Council.Today’s veto by Russia has denied for now an avenue for the families of the victims to bring perpetrators to justice. Russia’s actions are deeply troubling, but they are hardly surprising. Since 17 July 2014, Russia has been acting with regard to the independent Flight MH-17 investigations as if it had something to hide, as if there was somebody to mislead, someone to throw off course by disinformation. Today is no exception. The grim reality on the ground, however, belies the Russian narrative.Russian-backed illegal armed groups in control of the crash site tampered with evidence for days and weeks and precluded and restricted access for international experts and monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Only after immense international pressure under resolution 2166 (2014) were independent investigators able to conduct identification of the remains of the victims and collect evidence. Their work is vital, and we call on all States concerned to cooperate.The Dutch-led independent international investigation team includes experts from Australia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Russia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as from the European Aviation Safety Agency and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and enjoys the full trust and confidence of the concerned countries and the international community, including the ICAO and the United Nations. We have every confidence in the investigation. It has been conducted in a manner consistent with ICAO procedures and standards and the Chicago Convention. We thank the Joint Investigation Team countries for their consistent outreach and for their keeping the Council updated.Lithuania was a sponsor of the draft resolution put forward today by Malaysia (S/2015/562). Today, along with a majority of Council members, we are sending the clear message that acts of violence against civilians will not go unpunished. The shooting down of Flight MH-17 amounted to a threat to international peace and security and was a deliberate act. Accountability is not a concept on paper. An international tribunal backed by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations would have been the best way to ensure the judicial process’s impartiality and independence. We will support further efforts to pursue accountability, with or without Russia’s cooperation.The unhindered flow of arms, mercenaries and Russian troops into the sovereign territory of Ukraine created the conditions that enabled this tragedy to happen. Weeks before the downing of MH-17, the separatists claimed that they had acquired an SA-11 Buk missile system and used it to shoot down an Antonov AN-26 cargo plane at high altitude. Such weapons cannot be bought in a downtown Luhansk market. Nor can they be operated by a Donetsk miner.The foreign-orchestrated conflict in eastern Ukraine continues unabated, despite Russia’s denials of non-involvement, as was also the case with the occupation of Crimea. The ceasefires of September 2014 and February 2015 were intended to enable the combined Russian-separatist forces in Donbas to regroup. Recently, 52,000 Russian troops have been massing on the Ukrainian border. Since last fall, at two Russian-Ukrainian border crossings alone, the OSCE has counted 20,000 men in military uniforms crossing to and fro. That is two divisions without a single visa request. What would the OSCE be able to record if Russia were to comply with the Minsk agreements and allow it to monitor vast areas in Donbas, including the 400-kilometre-long Ukrainian-Russian border?The ominous signs do not end there. The OSCE has registered large concentrations of heavy weapons in the militant-held areas, including at a railway hub in Komsomolske. Only a few weeks ago, Alexei Markov of the Ghost Brigade in the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic said that his fighters were eager to launch a summer offensive, but that they wanted weapons from Moscow because they had very few, were running short of supplies and needed more troops, artillery and combat vehicles. All hostages and illegally detained persons were supposed to have been released. Russia has evidently found other excuses for ignoring the provisions of resolution 2202 (2015). Nadia Savchenko and other illegally held Ukrainians remain in Russian prisons, facing sham trials.This human tragedy and suffering in Ukraine must stop. The Minsk agreements must be implemented in good faith. The trilateral contact group, the OSCE and the United Nations should play critical roles. Russia and its militants must stop paying mere lip service to the agreements. Under extremely difficult circumstances, Ukraine is implementing the Minsk agreements. It has begun constitutional reform. It has made genuine efforts to implement painful reforms, fight corruption and liberate itself from the past. Ukraine must be free to pursue the path of reforms its people have chosen. Ukrainians want peace.Our solemn duty today was not to take sides but to ensure that justice was served. The Council has failed in that task. Today’s veto was a desperate attempt to delay accountability, but the efforts of the international community will not end here and those responsible will be held to account.","One year ago, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 2166 (2014). The resolution calls for an investigation into the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in accordance with international civil aviation guidelines. Most significantly, the resolution calls for accountability, transparency and justice for the victims. It is for those reasons that Nigeria voted in favour of draft resolution S/2015/562, which the Council has just considered. Had it been adopted, the draft resolution would have authorized the establishment of an international criminal tribunal to ascertain culpability for the crash as a precursor to prosecution and trial.The establishment of the tribunal would not only have brought justice to the victims and closure to their families, it would also have sent a strong message that the international community will not tolerate any act that threatens the safety of international civil aviation. We regret that the draft resolution was not adopted. Indeed, that brings to the fore once again the need for the Council to cultivate the practice of adopting a unified stance on matters requiring leadership in pursuit of international peace and security.","At the outset, allow me to welcome the Ministers who have come to this meeting from Malaysia, New Zealand, Australia, the Netherlands and Ukraine. We certainly appreciate all the efforts being made by those countries in the independent investigation on the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17.One full year later, Jordan voted in favour of draft resolution S/2015/562. We support the establishment of an international tribunal to prosecute the perpetrators of the downing of Flight MH-17. We believe that the perpetrators must be held accountable. Their actions led to the killing of 298 innocent persons. They must be brought to justice under an independent judicial mechanism that ensures effective, clear measures to hold them accountable.The importance of the draft resolution does not just lie in holding accountable the perpetrators of such acts, but also serves to deter any attempt to threaten the safety and security of international civil aviation in general. The targeting of civil aviation could stand as a precedent unless it is uprooted and deterred. We must prevent more such crimes and must not allow the targeting of civilians. We must not fail to hold perpetrators accountable.Although the draft resolution before the Security Council was not adopted today, efforts must continue to reach a common understanding on the measures to be taken and their implementation according to the options presented by the Secretary-General. We stress the importance of cooperation among all States in order to achieve justice for the victims of that tragedy.","Allow me to welcome your presence, Sir, and that of all of the other Ministers who are here today. One year after the tragedy, we reiterate our condolences to all of the families affected.My delegation would have liked the Council to have sent a unified message to all of the families of the victims of the tragic downing of Flight MH-17. Resolution 2166 (2014) was a major step forward in clarifying the facts by establishing a Joint Investigation Team, in parallel with the investigation conducted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). But there is no doubt that accountability is part and parcel of fundamental values that seek to see justice done and prevent any form of impunity.Chile is concerned About the effective application of these principles. We have always been ready to support any effort leading to a basic level of agreement that would make it possible to continue to investigate the facts and establish a jurisdictional mechanism that would develop and complement resolution 2166 (2014). Beyond the legitimate legal interpretations, it is essential for us that the exercise of jurisdiction be as expeditious as possible in response to the gravity of the events and because of the undoubted need to provide remedies to the families of the victims. To that end, Chile supported draft resolution S/2015/562 because justice and reparations constitute our world view and sense of collective action.In conclusion, we would like to end on a hopeful note that the Council will be able to send the message that the international community expects and hopes for — because that reinforces our legitimacy regardless of our reasonable differences.","I would first like to welcome all the ministers in the Chamber today.Exactly one year and 12 days ago we witnessed the horror of the downing in Donetsk province in Ukraine of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, which resulted in the deaths of 298 innocent people, 85 of them children. Chad would like to reiterate its firm condemnation of that abominable attack on a civilian aircraft and offer its deep sympathy and heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families and the Governments of the countries from which the victims came. We share in the immeasurable sorrow of the victims’ relatives and loved ones and we understand their justifiable impatience to know the truth and demand accountability from those who were responsible for the disaster.We should recall that resolution 2166 (2014), adopted immediately after the crash on 17 July 2014, states that those responsible for it should be held to account and that every State should cooperate fully with efforts to establish that responsibility. According to the preliminary report on the crash published on 10 September 2014 by the Dutch Safety Board, the plane disintegrated in mid-air as a result of “structural damage caused by a large number of high-energy objects that penetrated the aircraft from outside”. However, the origin of those objects was not specified.Chad continues to support every effort by the international community aimed at demanding accountability and assigning responsibility for the destruction of the aircraft. In that regard, we would like to thank the Malaysian delegation for presenting today’s draft resolution S/2015/562, on the creation of an international criminal tribunal. For several reasons, we were in favour from the start of the idea of creating such a tribunal, aimed at bringing to justice the perpetrators of these hateful crimes.The first is in order to respond to resolution 2166 (2014), which the Security Council adopted unanimously following the incident and which demanded that the destroyers of the Malaysian aircraft be brought to justice. The second is in order to honour the memory of the victims of the tragedy and emphasize our total solidarity with their loved ones, whose legitimate impatience — and that of the many delegations who have come to represent them here today — in the quest for truth and justice we share. The third is in order to ensure a credible, independent and impartial investigation aimed at achieving justice unshadowed by any pressure or manipulation, and to encourage cooperation between all States to that end. Fourth and last, to send a strong message of deterrence to all those in other areas of conflict who might make attempts to attack the security and safety of international civil aviation.For all those reasons, Chad voted in favour of the draft resolution presented by the Malaysian delegation, but unfortunately it was not adopted, owing to the opposition of some permanent members of the Council, a fact that we deeply regret. Despite the rejection of the draft resolution, we remain committed to supporting every effort designed to meet the demands of justice and we encourage the countries concerned and the members of the Council to do everything possible to respond to the legitimate expectations of the victims’ loved ones.",,"I thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to speak this afternoon.Canada continues to mourn the terrible loss of life aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, which was shot down on 17 July 2014 while flying over an area controlled by the pro-Russian forces in the east of the Ukraine. It is important for the Security Council to take decisive action to ensure that those responsible for the attack against Flight MH-17 answer for their actions and to send a clear message that attacks against civilian aircraft will not be tolerated. Canada has joined other States in mourning to co-sponsor draft resolution S/2015/562. Canada urges all States to cooperate in making sure that those who committed this heinous crime are held accountable for their actions. The international community owes it to the families and friends of the 283 passengers and 15 crew members who lost their lives that a full and impartial investigation into the crime is conducted and the perpetrators brought to justice.(spoke in English)Canada reiterates its support for resolution 2166 (2014) of 21 July 2014, in which the Security Council urged concerned States and organizations to undertake an independent international investigation. We are grateful to those who have supported the identification of victims, their recovery and repatriation, as well as the independent technical investigation. Canada has greatly appreciated the work done by the joint investigation team, comprising prosecution authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine, in conducting the criminal investigation. We have been cognizant of the importance of ensuring that the independent criminal investigation be followed without delay by an equally independent and impartial prosecution of the perpetrators. As such, we believed it wholly appropriate that steps be taken now to establish an international tribunal for this purpose because efforts to further obstruct the investigation or prosecution of this crime or to protect or support the perpetrators simply cannot be tolerated.Canada is profoundly disappointed by the outcome of today’s Security Council vote on the creation of an international criminal tribunal to prosecute those responsible for downing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 on 17 July 2014 over territory controlled by pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine. Canada very much regrets that due to Russia’s obstruction, the families and friends of the 283 passengers and 15 crew members who lost their lives will not see those responsible for this heinous crime brought to justice by an international tribunal immediately.","A year ago, the Philippines joined many other delegations in issuing a strong call in the Chamber for a full, thorough and independent investigation of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, which took the lives of 298 people, including three Filipinos, a mother and her two children. In July 2014, united with us in our grief, the Council adopted resolution 2166 (2014), aimed at securing justice for those innocent and irreplaceable lives and honouring their memory.Twelve months after the incident and the adoption of that resolution, the world is still groping for answers. The perpetrators remain free of all accountability. The families of the victims continue to seek answers, justice and closure. If adopted, today’s draft resolution (S/2015/562) would have been a crucial step in fulfilling the commitment we made — both to the families of the victims and to the larger international community — to holding the perpetrators of this tragic incident and heinous crime fully accountable.As one of the grieving nations, the Philippines sponsored today’s draft resolution in order to lend our strong support to the initiative taken by the Governments of Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine in seeking an international investigation of the incident and the establishment of an international tribunal for prosecuting those responsible for the downing of Flight MH-17. The Philippines and the Filipino people are indeed indebted to those nations for their sustained efforts and to those who believed in the merits of the draft resolution and gave it their full support.We deeply regret, however, that the Council was unable to adopt the draft resolution today, representing a huge disservice to those who perished and to their families, their nations and the world. But the search for answers and justice will continue. The Philippines stands ready to support and collaborate with other countries to ensure that those responsible are finally brought to justice and that such tragic incidents will never happen again.","One year ago, last July, we witnessed the horrific scene of a civilian aircraft blown out of the skies over Ukraine. The lives of 283 passengers and 15 crew members were shattered in an instant, but the pain of their families continues to this day. Among those killed were 80 children, 80 precious girls and boys who lost their lives in one tragic moment.As a representative of one of the grieving nations, I join with my colleagues to remember those we lost on Flight MH-17, to declare our support for the investigation and to insist that those responsible be held to account. The downing of this civilian aircraft was not simply a tragedy, it was a deliberate attack. The attack was an attempt to disrupt the law and order of the skies and to instil fear in those who use air travel.Tragically, we in Israel are all too familiar with attempts to use violence to paralyse our lives and our routines. We have learned from this painful experience that if we do not take steps to deter future attacks, the consequences can be dreadful.On that difficult day one year ago, 298 people were killed as they made their way through the skies. The passengers on the fated flight spoke different languages, had different destinations and different plans, but they all shared one thing in common: they were all innocent people going about their daily lives.One of the passengers on board was Itamar Avnon, a 27-year-old Israeli citizen. Itamar was on his way back to Australia, where he was a second-year business student at Swinburne University in Melbourne. Itamar had returned to Israel for the wedding of a friend and to visit his 96-year-old grandfather in Haifa. He then flew to visit his family in the Netherlands, tragically, for the last time. Although his life was short, he filled those years with life. Whether it was his love of travel, of football, or, most importantly, his friends, Itamar lived life to the fullest and brought love and laughter to all who knew him. May his memory, and the memory of all those who perished, be a blessing.We thank and support those carrying out the investigation into this horrible incident, and we welcome the progress made so far. We look forward to the final report.",,,,

S/PV.7457,05/06/2015,Resurgence of military activity in the Donbas region,"I wish to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman and Mr. Hug for their briefings. In February, the leaders of Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine reached an important consensus in Minsk on the political settlement of the Ukrainian crisis. The Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 2202 (2015), endorsing the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements by the parties concerned, which reflected support for a political settlement of the Ukrainian crisis. After the Council’s adoption of the resolution, progress was made in such areas as the ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons and the establishment of working groups, as outlined in the Minsk package of measures. For some time, the overall situation in eastern Ukraine remained stable and a ceasefire was generally observed. Recently, the situation in eastern Ukraine has again deteriorated. China calls on the parties concerned to keep calm, exercise restraint, consolidate the hard-won ceasefire and press ahead with a political settlement of the Ukrainian crisis in order to achieve peace and tranquillity in Ukraine at an early date. The international community should make joint efforts in that direction. The Council’s discussion should also play a constructive role in that regard. China has always respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, including Ukraine, and it believes that dialogue and consultations are the only solution to the Ukrainian issue. China calls on the parties concerned to make joint efforts to find a comprehensive, balanced and lasting political solution as soon as possible so as to achieve peace, tranquillity, stability and development in Ukraine and the region as a whole. China will continue to play a constructive role in promoting a political settlement of the Ukrainian issue. ","I thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman and Mr. Alexander Hug, Deputy Chief Monitor of the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), for their briefings. The latest developments on the ground are worrying. I refer of course to the resumption of fighting on Wednesday in Marinka, west of Donetsk, and of the increase in incidents at numerous points on the front line. According to the information we have, the attack was launched by separatist troops in violation of the commitments made in Minsk on 12 February. We firmly condemn all violations of the ceasefire declared in February and urge the parties to respect their commitments under the Minsk agreement’s implementation package. It is clear, however, that the fighting, which is at a level of intensity not seen since February and the attack on Debaltseve, comes primarily from limited forces in a sector that has already been the scene of several violations of the ceasefire, to our regret. As far as we know, the separatist forces amount to a half-battalion supported by armoured elements and they have been halted. The situation, however, presents a number of features that call for extreme vigilance, particularly the concentration of heavy weapons that violate the Minsk agreement, which must be stopped immediately. Similarly, the presence among the separatists of many foreign fighters who are radicalized, bellicose and undisciplined shows that Moscow must do more, and do better, to control the actions of the separatists and mercenaries. The deterioration of the situation on the ground should not detract from the overall situation in Ukraine. Despite the attack, the Minsk process is ongoing and there are true signs of hope. From the security perspective, the Minsk process has launched a positive momentum, even if it has been only unevenly applied to date. The average number of victims per day has dropped significantly since the adoption of the Minsk package on 12 February. More than 2,500 Ukrainian soldiers have been released. Furthermore, at the second level of the process, there have recently been tenuous but encouraging developments in the political process. In particular, the working groups proposed by Ms. Tagliavini in her statement before the Council three months ago (see S/PV.7400) have been established and have already met. Discussions are still getting off the ground. They have been delayed by numerous signs of distrust and sensitivity on both sides. We note that in the groups, substantial and productive debates have achieved tangible progress on organizing elections in the separatist zone. In particular, a voting method for the separatist zone has been accepted by all, and that is a positive sign that touches on one of the key aspects of the crisis. Similarly, the Trilateral Contact Group, the cornerstone of the implementation of the Minsk agreements, within which the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and plays a crucial role pursuant to resolution 2202 (2015), has met on several occasions. In that regard, we regret the change of heart of the Russian party which, in leaving the discussion table with great fanfare on Tuesday, is attempting to impose the separatists as the sole Ukrainian interlocutors in that forum. We remind Russia, a member of the Trilateral Contact Group and, more than any other party, subject to the provisions of resolution 2202 (2015), that it cannot shirk its obligations. The conflict in Ukraine is not a domestic crisis in which Russia can simply play the role of well-meaning mediator between two camps. Everyone knows the role that it has played in the crisis from the start, and Russia has been paying the consequences since then. We are at a moment of truth in the Ukrainian crisis. The future of the Trilateral Contact Group is at stake and we cannot allow that crucial part of the diplomatic framework, which was put together so painstakingly, to be simply withdrawn and disqualified, particularly as it was endorsed by the Council in resolution 2202 (2015). More broadly, we must do all we can to maintain the momentum and methodology that we have used up til now. Our priority must be the full implementation of both the security and political aspects of the Minsk package, which must enter into force simultaneously before the end of the year. Respect for the timeframe established in Minsk is crucial and in our opinion it is unacceptable that it be allowed to slide. The timeframe is ambitious, but the Minsk process is the only possible means to avoid a resumption of violence from which no one would benefit. A Normandy format follow-up meeting of political experts will take place in Paris on 10 June. We call on Russia to stop trying to extricate itself from the negotiating process and to exercise its responsibility over the separatists. It is, moreover, important to stress to the Kyiv authorities that they must begin a real dialogue with the separatists in order to organize local elections in full respect for the Minsk timeframe, and to implement the decentralization of Ukraine. When proposals made by the separatists are unacceptable to Ukraine, it must respond with its own so that the negotiations can move forward. At this crucial moment in the implementation of the Minsk process, our commitment is more important than ever. The commitment of France is unwavering. In the context of the Normandy format, France and Germany will continue to bring pressure to bear on the parties to ensure that the OSCE enjoys the freedom of movement it requires to perform the tasks entrusted to it under the Minsk agreements, particularly in terms of monitoring the ceasefire and the withdrawal of weapons. Finally, we recall our commitment to the sovereignty, independence and territorial independence of Ukraine within its international recognized borders. ","We have been discussing the situation in Ukraine since February 2014. At that time, there was an agreement between the President and the opposition. If that agreement had been implemented, Kyiv would have implemented constitutional reform by the end of last year and we would have observed a gradual normalization of and democratic development in Ukraine. Instead, a different logic has been in place, supported by people who want to see their political preferences for the future of Ukraine and its entire population prevail. This is the root of a tragic situation that has gone on for too long. We need to put an end to it. That is why the Minsk agreements exist. We wish to express our gratitude to Under- Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman, and the Deputy Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, Mr. Alexander Hug, for their briefings. We share the great concern at the resurgence of military activity in Donbas. We need to take measures to stabilize the situation. In this regard, we welcome the efforts of the OSCE and the Joint Centre for Control and Coordination. The package of measures for implementing the Minsk agreements adopted on 12 February gives a concise and clear road map for settling the Ukrainian crisis. The Security Council unanimously supported the document in resolution 2202 (2015), assuming its part of political responsibility for settling the situation in Ukraine. Therefore, here in the Security Council, we need to deal with the causes of the ongoing escalation. Almost four months have gone by since 12 February, yet what has been done to implement the package of measures? Pursuant to paragraph 4, on the first day after the withdrawal of heavy weapons, a dialogue should have begun on the modalities for conducting local elections in line with Ukrainian legislation and laws on the special status of Donbas, which were adopted back in the autumn of 2014. The Supreme Council of Ukraine — the Verkhovna Rada — was required only to adopt a law on this territory with respect to its special status. Instead, however, the Ukrainian parliament has introduced amendments that were not agreed to by Donetsk and Luhansk and which were not acceptable to them, and the territory itself was declared to be occupied, which completely subverted the agreements reached in Minsk. The amendments simply overlooked the adoption of the special status and did not provide for local elections. Kyiv has begun to toughen its rhetoric, saying that elections could only take place once the south-east of Ukraine was under its full control. Over all this time, Kyiv has refused to have direct dialogue with the representatives of Dombas, despite provisions for such dialogue in paragraphs 4, 9, 11 and 12 of the package of measures. This is one of the obvious reasons why it has been so difficult to start negotiations in the Trilateral Contact Group and its subgroups. In violation of paragraph 5 of the package of measures, Kyiv has also not adopted the amnesty law which would prohibit any punishment for persons involved in the activities taking place in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Moreover, the Ukrainian leadership has repeatedly stated publicly that it does not intend to comply with that provision. One of the central elements in the implementation package is instituting constitutional reforms by the end of the year. The parameters of those reforms were outlined in Minsk with the active participation of the leaders of the Normandy quartet. Paragraph 11 states in black and white that decentralization must be implemented while taking into account the particularities of specific districts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as agreed on with the representatives of those districts. The package includes provisions on the right to linguistic self-determination, the creation of people’s militias by decision of local councils, the expansion of local Governments’ powers to appoint chief prosecutors and judges, and the conclusion of agreements with Kyiv in various areas, as well as the implementation of cross- border cooperation with Russia. Kyiv finally established a constitutional commission on 3 March that included foreign experts but not a single representative of Donetsk and Luhansk, whose proposals for constitutional reform were simply ignored. Kyiv’s refusal to comply with the humanitarian and socioeconomic provisions of the package of measures presents the population of Donbas with serious challenges. The noose of the economic blockade around Donetsk and Luhansk is being drawn tighter and tighter. The Kyiv officials do not hide the fact that those restrictive measures are purely punitive, saying that the people of the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics are being punished for their support of the volunteers. People have been cut off from social benefits and access to food and medicines is difficult, since commercial transport is not being allowed through. Kyiv has not reacted to the remonstrations of international humanitarian and human-rights workers regarding the fact that it is children and the elderly, the most vulnerable, who suffer. Thanks to humanitarian assistance from Russia, the people of Donbas are surviving in a literal sense. We have already sent 28 convoys with more than 36,000 tons of humanitarian deliveries in food, daily necessities and medicines. The Ukrainian border guards and customs officers finally began recently to participate in monitoring them, something we have invited them to do from the start. It is encouraging that Switzerland recently contributed by sending a significant delivery of reagents for purifying drinking water. But the basic problem of difficult access for humanitarian assistance remains, thanks to Kyiv’s bureaucratic obstacles. In addition to all this, the response to appeals for financing is at only 21 per cent. The Ukrainian Government has also been unable or unwilling to bring all the punitive battalions under its control, in accordance with paragraph 10 of the Minsk agreement. They continue to wreak havoc. For example, during the truce the Aydar troops in the Luhansk region switched to extorting and abusing civilians, including the elderly, trying to cross the line of contact on foot in order to get cash or buy food. After the Minsk agreement was reached on 12 February, a fair amount was done to implement important provisions on removing heavy weaponry, yet attacks on civilian towns and villages east of the boundary line nonetheless continued almost daily, terrorizing the local population. I will cite just a few examples. On 28 May, three people, including an 11-year-old girl and her father, died in shelling in Horlivka, and many of the town’s residents were injured. On 3 June, a massive bombardment of Donetsk killed at least six civilians died and wounded more than 90, besides which there was firing from the town of Marinka, as has been mentioned today, which appears to have provoked the latest escalation of military action. On 4 June, when Telmanovo was attacked by Ukrainian forces, shells hit a playground, killing a year-old infant. Accusations have been levelled at the militias, but we can only ask ourselves why all we hear in statements from Kyiv is about military casualties, while there are reports from Donetsk and Luhansk of the death of civilians and the destruction of civilian infrastructure — hospitals, schools, kindergartens and houses. In that regard, we ask that the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission not simply focus on the violations of the ceasefire agreement and on determining who violated it, but also describe clearly what the targets of those attacks were and whether their victims were civilians or military units firing on residential areas. We must have a clear picture of what is happening in Donbas and who is committing violations not just of the Minsk agreement but also of the norms of international humanitarian law. Against that background, it is surprising to see the indifference of our Western partners, who are usually so fond of pontificating about humanitarian issues. Furthermore, there is no end to the shipments of military supplies, including armoured vehicles, along with the hundreds of instructors sent to train the Ukrainian forces. There have been numerous reports of sightings near Donbas of foreign mercenaries and private military companies. Is that not a direct encouragement to a resumption of hostilities, not to mention a clear violation of paragraph 10, which provides for the withdrawal of foreign armed forces, military equipment and mercenaries from Ukrainian territory? For all practical purposes, it is no secret that Kyiv has used the Minsk truce to rebuild and regroup its forces, which is why the latest outbreak of hostilities, while seriously worrying, is hardly surprising. However, we should not ignore the fact that it occurred after a series of very positive meetings between the Trilateral Contact Group and its working groups, most recently in Minsk on 2 June. And although they have yet to reach a final agreement, there has been progress on every issue under discussion, including on such complex subjects as the demilitarization of Shirokino and including mortars with a calibre under 100 millimetres on the list of excluded weapons. Definite progress has been made on the question of starting direct consultations between Kyiv and Luhansk and Donetsk on preparing for the holding of local elections. That raises the suspicion that it is precisely this positive news that is linked to the armed provocations being conducted against cities in Donbas. Perhaps Kyiv, particularly the so-called war party, has understood that it cannot continue to sabotage the implementation package forever. Even the capitals that are most loyal to Kyiv have begun to betray signs of irritation, saying that the Kyiv authorities have overstepped the bounds of decency in violating or simply ignoring the Minsk agreement. And military action is the most reliable diversionary manoeuvre, since one can blame anything on the war. This is a critical moment. If we continue to allow Kyiv to drag its feet in taking what are absolutely essential political steps regarding Donbas, the situation may again spiral out of control, with unpredictable consequences. We urge the members of the Council with influence over the Kyiv authorities to make every effort to ensure that this does not occur. I will not go into a discussion with my Ukrainian colleague of the Charter of the United Nations, international law or international humanitarian law, for that matter, since too many of those instruments’ provisions are being violated by the Kyiv authorities in their so-called anti-terrorist but in fact punitive operations in eastern Ukraine. I would like to make a few comments with regard to the statement made by the representative of the United States of America. In her statement, she raised a very surprising issue — that of the Kyiv authorities’ provocation of hostilities by their systematic, months- long attacks on cities. Is this not a provocation? Unfortunately, the Council does not see that or Kyiv’s many other actions that violate the Minsk agreements and impede the implementation of the political provisions of the package of measures. After the Sochi meeting with President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov, Mr. Kerry called upon Kyiv not to use force. Unfortunately, the request made by the representative of the United States was not heard. We would like United States diplomacy to be more consistent and to follow up on the pronouncements of its Secretary of State. We do not want to believe that there is a war party in Washington, D.C., like that in Kyiv. We cannot agree with the statement by our British colleague that the crisis in Ukraine did not begin with the unification of Crimea and Russia. The crisis began with the externally supported campaign to overthrow a democratically elected President of Ukraine. It was exacerbated when efforts to implement the 21 February 2014 agreement failed. Political influences were also at work, followed by the terror in Odessa in May 2014 and the campaign we are seeing now in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Finally, in our discussion today we have heard a number of unfounded and extraordinarily polemical statements, but I would still like to suggest that this meeting has been helpful. We affirmed our commitment to the Minsk agreement and to resolution 2202 (2015). We think it important that various delegations called for direct dialogue between Kyiv, Donetsk and Luhansk. That theme was touched on even by the United States, although too timidly. That kind of dialogue is absolutely crucial to full compliance with the Minsk agreement, which Russia continues to strive for. I will be very brief. Fortunately, the Secretariat has established detailed protocols for the Security Council that cover all the questions that the representative of the United States touched on just now and that save me the trouble of a more extensive reaction to her remarks. ","I thank you, Mr. President, for convening this urgent meeting. I thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman and Mr. Hug, Deputy Chief Monitor for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). It is disturbing that the Council must again return to this issue, since fighting has flared up and Russian-backed separatists have broken the ceasefire provided for in the Minsk agreements. The fighting on Wednesday around Marinka and Kyivsky was an alarming escalation of violence in eastern Ukraine. It is clear from the OSCE spot report that this was a separatist assault on Ukrainian military units. The OSCE observed heavy weapons mobilizing in the territory controlled by the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic. Those weapons moved westward, in complete disregard of the terms of the Minsk agreements. Action of that kind and on that scale was clearly premeditated. We have previously seen Russian-backed separatists seek to provoke a Ukrainian response and then twist that — as the Russian media are again seeking to do — into claims that it was the Ukrainians who launched an assault. These feints are transparent, and Russian claims and those of their separatist proxies carry no credibility. The world is watching. We know who is supporting the separatists. We have seen Russian soldiers captured in the Donbas. We have heard Russia’s attempts to come up with innocent explanations for their presence there. We have noted the amendments to the Russian State secrecy law, which now prohibits the release of information about the deaths of soldiers in peacetime. This legislative action suggests that the Russian authorities want to silence the justified questions they are facing from families, journalists and civil society. We have seen Russian-supplied T-72 tanks and Uragan rocket launchers operating on Ukrainian soil, and we have seen countless conveys of supplies flooding across the border from Russia. Russia claims these are humanitarian supplies but will not cooperate with the legitimate Government in Kyiv in a way that allow for verification of these claims. The tragedy and the hypocrisy of the separatists is that the ordinary people of Ukraine are the ones who suffer. More than 6,000 have been killed, and more than 1.3 million have fled their homes. We hope that Mr. Šimonović, of the High Commissioner’s Office, will be able to brief the Council on his recent report on the distressing human rights situation in eastern Ukraine later this month. There are three things that now need to happen to prevent further escalation. First, Russia must immediately withdraw its military forces from Ukraine, stop its flow of weapons to the separatists and make every effort to secure a political solution to this crisis. This includes the immediate release of Nadiya Savchenko, who has been illegally detained for nearly a year. Secondly, we urge Russia to use its considerable influence on the separatists so that they cease their provocative behaviour and live up to their commitment to implement fully the Minsk agreements. The separatists forces are Russia’s creation; they are Russia’s tool. Russia has the capacity and the influence to control the separatist forces. It must exercise that influence to ensure compliance with the Minsk agreements. If it is not ready to do so, the Council must be clear in its condemnation. Thirdly, it is vital that all parties engage seriously in the process and implement the Minsk agreements. The Trilateral Contact Group and Trilateral working groups are essential mechanisms for making this happen, and their roles are clearly spelled out in paragraph 13 of the February Minsk agreement. We need all parties, both Russians and Ukrainians, to engage in these groups in a genuine and constructive way. We were disturbed to hear that the economic working group was not able to meet earlier this week because a Russian participant did not attend and that Russian and separatists participants walked out of a session of the Trilateral Contact Group. The European Union has made clear that the duration of sanctions against Russia is directly linked to the complete implementation of the Minsk agreements, and through resolution 2202 (2015) this Council has made clear that we too expect complete compliance with the Minsk agreements. So there is no military solution. The Minsk agreements are the only way that stability can be restored in eastern Ukraine. We must all recommit to their implementation and to upholding the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Let us not forget that the crisis started with the illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia. More than a year since that illegal annexation, we cannot lose sight of what is at stake in eastern Ukraine. A return to violence and conflict would come at a terrible human cost for all sides, and it would represent a further attack on the rules-based international system that we have shared and valued for the past 70 years. We all depend on that system enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Any escalation in Ukraine calls into question Russia’s commitment to those principles. Our relationship to Russia extends far beyond the borders of Ukraine, but in order to foster the cooperation and trust we want, those relationships must be based on honesty, mutual respect and dialogue. Until Russia is able to demonstrate that commitment in Ukraine, the Council needs to remain actively engaged in overseeing the full and timely implementation of resolution 2202 (2015). ","I thank you, Sir, for organizing today’s meeting to speak to the recent developments in eastern Ukraine. join others in thanking our briefers, Under Secretary-General Feltman and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Deputy Chief Monitor Hug, for providing the Council and the international community with the facts underlining the escalation in violence, which are critical in a conflict where some continue to try to obscure the truth. On 3 June, combined Russian-separatist forces launched multiple, coordinated attacks west of the Minsk line of contact in Donetsk. The attacks were concentrated on the towns of Marinka and Krasnohorivka. The Russian Federation and its separatist allies have offered multiple, often conflicting explanations for those attacks. In some instances, Russia and the separatists have blamed Ukraine for inciting the attacks. For example, a Russian presidential spokesman attributed the violations of the ceasefire to the “provocative actions of the Ukrainian armed forces”, claiming that “the Ukrainian side has repeatedly made similar efforts to escalate tensions against the backdrop of international operations”. Similarly, the so-called Defence Minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic blamed Ukraine for provocations and what he called a breach of the Minsk agreements that led to the fighting. Exactly what the so-called provocations are was never explained. This set of arguments has been undermined by some of the separatists themselves, who seem to have forgotten to run their tweets and their blog posts by Moscow. During the attacks, one tweeted: “Marinka is ours”, posting a photograph of armed soldiers atop a tank flying the separatist flag. A post on a separatist website said: “As a result of a massive attack by armed forces of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Marinka has been liberated”. In other instances, Russia has argued that the attacks were justified because the areas that are actually part of the separatist-controlled territory under the Minsk agreements are these areas. They are not. That was the case that Russia made about Marinka and Krasnohorivka yesterday at a meeting of the OSCE. We have seen this tactic before when combined Russian- separatist forces encircled and attacked Debaltseve immediately after signing the package of measures at Minsk on 12 February. As separatist commander Eduard Basurin told Reuters on 15 February: “Of course we can open fire on Debaltseve. The territory is internal — ours. And internal is internal. But along the line of confrontation there is no shooting”. The problem with this line of argument is quite simply that it is false. At no point did the Minsk agreements recognize Marinka and Krasnohorivka as separatist-controlled territory, nor did they grant the separatists control over Debaltseve or other areas that combined Russian-separatist forces have seized or tried to seize. Yet, for Russia and the separatists, it seems the contact line can shift to include the territories that they feel they deserve. The Kyiv-born surrealist master Mikhail Bulgakov put this problem a different way: “The tongue can conceal the truth, but the eyes never.” In this case, the objective eyes in eastern Ukraine belong to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, and what it tells us is that on the evening of 2 June and in the early morning of 3 June, the Mission “observed the movement of a large amount of heavy weapons in areas controlled by the Donetsk People’s Republic, generally in a westerly direction towards the contact line, close to Marinka, preceding and during the fighting”. To repeat, according to the Special Monitoring Mission, heavy weapons from the Russian-backed separatist side moved westward preceding as well as during the fighting. The Mission tried to contact high- ranking Donetsk People’s Republic personnel over an hour-and-a-half period on the morning of 3 June but reported: “Either they were unavailable or did not wish to speak to the SMM”. The eyes do not conceal the truth, and the truth here is that the recent violence was rooted in a combined Russian-separatist assault. Those and other joint attacks by Russian-separatist forces have deadly consequences. At least five Ukrainian soldiers were killed and 38 wounded in the assault on the towns. The number of casualties is surely higher, but we do not, unfortunately, have reliable reports from the separatist side. That is because, as the United Nations human rights monitoring unit noted in its report of 15 May, independent media have been prosecuted, threatened and otherwise muzzled in separatist-controlled territory. We also do not know how many Russian soldiers were killed in recent attacks, or in any of their operations in eastern Ukraine for that matter. Russia continues, despite incidents such as the recent capture of two special operations Russian soldiers in Shchastya last month, to deny any military involvement in eastern Ukraine. And just last week President Putin signed a decree classifying any death of Russian soldiers in “special operations“ in peacetime a State secret — a policy which previously was limited to wartime only. Not content with denying their military service in life, Russia now denies their loved ones respect and closure, not to mention social services, for their service in death. It denies the Russian people knowledge to which they are entitled of a conflict their Government has been fuelling with weapons, training and soldiers. No matter what is one’s opinion of the open secret that is Russia’s military involvement in eastern Ukraine and occupied Crimea, the dignified recognition of one’s dead should have primacy. Of course, suffering is hardly limited to those involved in the fighting. Civilians living near and along the front lines continue to endure profound hardship. Approximately 1.3 million Ukrainians have been displaced by the fighting. Small children on the front lines have become used to going to school and sleeping in basements. Families live underground for months at a time. The elderly and disabled are trapped, with little access to vital medicines and other forms of assistance. A health professional working in Debaltseve said, “I have met elderly people who say that they would just like to die. They do not have depression; they just do not want to be 80 years old and living in a basement.” By now, the international community is quite familiar with Russia’s playbook when it comes to efforts to occupy the territory of its sovereign neighbours, as it did it Crimea and before that in Transnistria, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The consensus here and in the international community remains that Minsk’s implementation is the only viable way out of this deadly conf lict. The Ukrainian Government has made good-faith efforts to honour that consensus, notwithstanding the seemingly endless violations by Russia and the separatists, and to deliver on the commitments made at Minsk. Ukraine is holding direct dialogue with the separatists — a bitter pill to swallow, but one that they have swallowed for the sake of peace and for the sake of the implementation of the Minsk agreements. At the same time, Ukraine has undertaken critical efforts, with the participation of Ukrainian civil society, to address pervasive problems that it inherited from its predecessors, like widespread corruption, as well as to pursue crucial reforms such as decentralization. Ukraine cooperates with the international monitors and bodies and has committed to addressing identified areas of concern. The United States will continue to raise tough issues and those areas of concern, including some raised here today by the briefers, with the Government of Ukraine, and we will support the Government and the Ukrainian people as they continue their efforts towards meaningful reform. Yet Russia — and the separatists that it trains, arms and fights alongside and with whom it shares command- and-control systems in eastern Ukraine — continues to ignore the consensus. Flouting the commitments it made at Minsk, it goes right on applying its playbook in new territories, as though the Council and the world are too blind or too easily deceived to notice. We must not let ourselves be deceived. The consequences of Russia’s contempt for Minsk and the rules undergirding our international peace and security are too great both for the integrity of the international system and for the rights and welfare of the Ukrainian people. We cannot fail to see and fail to act. We must not stop applying pressure until Ukrainians get the stable democracy, territorial integrity and sovereignty they yearn for and deserve. In closing, I would just like to note the absurdity of two things. The first is the representative of the Russian Federation’s citing of the Charter of the United Nations in the context of a discussion about Ukraine when, despite the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is an open secret, there is nothing secret about Russia’s declared annexation of Crimea; and that what was once denied in this Chamber — namely, that Russian regular soldiers were in Crimea — is now an openly admitted part of the facts on the ground that Russia has created in Crimea, and is what we have seen consistently, as the story has shifted. I think the representative of Ukraine asked a very important question. what is the legal authority for Russia’s presence in eastern Ukraine? Where in the United Nations Charter is that stipulated? The second irony is the great emphasis on a political process — an emphasis that everyone in the Council is deeply invested in. And yet Russia’s response from start to finish in this crisis has been coercive and militarized. That emphasis on the political implementation — the core reality that there can only be a political solution — is something that we urge the Russian Federation to embrace not only in words but in actions on the ground. ",,,,,,,,,,,"I take this opportunity to
congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of
the presidency of the Council for the month of June.
It is of high importance that the Security Council is
holding a meeting on the current situation in and around
Ukraine. I would like to express my gratitude to our
briefers, Mr. Jeffrey Feltman and Mr. Alexander Hug,
for their important messages on the current situation on
the ground and the measures taken by the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to
monitor the implementation of the Minsk agreements.
I would like to express my gratitude to all
members of the Council for their dedication to the
implementation of the Minsk agreements. I thank them
for their solidarity.
Two days ago, we listened carefully to a lecture
from the Russian delegation on what Ukraine is doing
wrong. I would like to start by reminding the Russian
authorities that Ukraine has a full right to defend its
territorial integrity and sovereignty, which are being
challenged by Russia’s occupation of Crimea and the
aggression against our eastern regions. This right
to defend ourselves is provided by our Constitution
and the Charter of the United Nations — namely,
Article 51 — and includes the right to invite other
countries to help us with self-defence.
What are the legal sources to justify the Russian
decision to send weapons, troops, mercenaries? There
are none. No justification can be found in the Charter
of the United Nations. That is why I would like to
start by drawing the Security Council’s attention
to the Russian Federation’s and the Russian-backed terrorists’ grave violations of the ceasefire and Minsk agreements in general, which were explicitly endorsed by resolution 2202 (2015).On 3 June, the militants, with the direct backing of Russian regular armed forces, carried out a massive targeted assault on Ukrainian forces around Marinka as well as an attack near Shchastya. Some 1,000 persons, including Russian regular military cadre, and 30 tanks were engaged in the assault near Marinka. Ukrainian forces were shelled 82 times, including 11 times with the Grad system. Artillery fire was professionally coordinated, which also attests to the presence of Russian regular artillery crews.These attacks were intended to test the defence and response capabilities of the Ukrainian forces and to seize control of territory and vital socioeconomic infrastructure — the Karlovske water reservoir, the Kurakhove and Shchastya power stations, and the Volnovakha railway hub. If the attackers had captured Marinka, they would have been able to seize positions from which they could impose an economic blockade on Mariupol, surround Ukrainian forces in Avdiivka and near Donetsk airport, thereby enabling a larger offensive along the front line. The Ukrainian anti-terrorist operation forces fought off these assaults. However, five servicemen were killed in action, four of them in Marinka, and 38 were wounded. Moreover, three civilians were reported dead.Meanwhile, after the failure of the 3 June assault, Russian-backed terrorists continued attacks overnight. In the direction of Mariupol, the terrorists shelled Shyrokyne with artillery, mortars, grenade launchers and small arms. In the direction of Luhansk, the militants attacked Donetske, Novotoshkivske, Stanytsya Luhanska and Krymske. In the direction of Artemivsk, the terrorists shelled Zolote with grenade launchers and Leninske with small arms. In the direction of Donetsk, the terrorists attacked Pisky with mortars and Novotroitske with grenade launchers.Russia and its proxies in Donbas have repeatedly violated the Minsk agreements of 5 and 19 September 2014 as well as of 12 February 2015. The assault near Mariynka became the second large-scale assault after the flagrant assault on Debaltseve in February. It occurred immediately after Russia’s attempt to disrupt the meeting of the Trilateral Contact Group and its thematic subgroups in Minsk on 2 June. We are sure that the massive targeted assault around Marinka was planned in advance by the Russian Federation, and the conclusions of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission prove it. In particular,“Between 2230 hours on 2 June and 0530 hours on 3 June the [Mission] observed the movement of a large amount of heavy weapons in the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic ... in a westerly direction towards the contact line — close to Marinka, preceding and during the fighting”.The Mission observed and tracked, inter alia, movements of armoured vehicles, including battle tanks, heavy artillery, military trucks and more. It is noteworthy that the Mission made several attempts to contact the high-ranking leaders of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic in order to facilitate a cessation of the fighting around Marinka, but without success. The so-called leaders did not respond to the Mission.Ukraine has consistently and in good faith lived up to the Minsk agreements in full and tried to use all possible diplomatic leverage to deter escalation. Thanks to the Ukrainian Army’s effective defence, Ukraine has avoided new wave of conflict escalation in Donbas and discouraged the Kremlin’s attempts to subvert the provisions of both the resolution 2202 (2015) and the Minsk agreements by making accusations against the Ukrainian side. I would like to underscore that we promptly informed the OSCE Mission that Ukrainian armed forces’ heavy weapons would be returned to the contact line in order to deal with the real threat posed by the fighting in Marinka and to defend civilians living in the local areas.The recent provocative steps taken by the Russian side clearly indicate Russia’s intentions to escalate the conflict and disrupt the Minsk process. The recent assaults are an attempt by the Russian side to exert military pressure on international players on the eve of important international events. The task of the Security Council is to prevent the aggressor from taking further destructive actions in this direction. We have to use all possible political and diplomatic leverage in this regard.It is not only the OSCE Mission that continuously witnesses the deterioration of the situation on the ground. A few days ago, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights published its tenth report on the human rights situation in Ukraine. It is important that the report clearly highlights the responsibility of the Russian Federation for the deterioration of the situation in certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine. In particular, it takes note of the Russian
Federation’s supplying modern types of heavy weaponry
and mercenaries and widely confirms that crimes
and human rights violations have been committed by
militants with Russia’s support. The difficult human
rights situation in the temporarily occupied Crimea is
also reflected in the document. The Office notes that the
so-called Crimean authorities continue to restrict the
rights of ethnic Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar people.
Let me go back to where I began. Taking into
account Russia’s serious violations of resolution 2202
(2015), I would kindly request that Security Council
members promptly react to those provocations and
violations and make every effort to promote a peaceful
resolution of the conflict. The international community
previously stated that an assault on Mariupol would be
a red line which, if crossed by Russia, would trigger
an immediate and resolute response. In the light of the
events of 3 June, the same approach should be applied
to the Marinka case.
At the same time, we urge the Russian Federation
and its proxies to immediately start fulfilling their
obligations under the provisions of the Minsk
agreements and resolution 2202 (2015). We demand that
Russia withdraw its armed forces from Ukraine, stop
fortifying the terrorist organizations with personnel
and weapons, cease its destabilizing and provocative
actions in Ukraine, and release all hostages. Russia
must also end its occupation of Crimea, which remains
an integral part of Ukraine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I would like to thank Jeffrey Feltman and Alexander
Hug for their briefings. I would also like to thank
Malaysia for having convened this meeting of the
Security Council involving the application of resolution
2202 (2015), in which we made a commitment to closely
follow up the situation in that area.
Unfortunately, in the past few days we have
seen events that have made this meeting necessary.
We have listened to the briefers talk about a serious
worsening of the situation. I believe that everyone here
agrees that the Minsk agreements are the only tool we
have. Promoted by France and Germany, they were
accepted by the parties and endorsed by the Security
Council. Consequently, we must give them our full
and unconditional support. However, during the past
weeks, there have been major violations, and we have
listened to very detailed explanations of the situation in
Marinka. In the end, what is happening?
What is happening is that those who must face
the consequences are always the civilian population.
The figures speak for themselves. We have heard the
figures of 1.3 million displaced persons, of 600,000
newly displaced in a relatively short period of time.
This occurred in a country, Ukraine, that previously
was not on the list of the internally displaced persons
but now unfortunately figures on the list of the top ten.
It is a tragic situation in Donbas, and there are major
difficulties in humanitarian access for both personnel
and supplies. The humanitarian response of the
international community has been insufficient.
Accordingly, Spain calls anew for an immediate
ceasefire and for the subsequent and also immediate
withdrawal of heavy weapons. We call upon Russia
to exercise all of its influence and to require from the
rebel groups the immediate and strict implementation
of what has been agreed, thus complying also with
its obligation as a signatory to the Minsk agreements.
We also call on Ukraine to continue to move forward
in complying with the commitments undertaken in
Minsk, including the non-military components of the
agreement. I trust that at the next meeting, on 10 June,
in the Normandy format, we will have seen progress
and be able to say that the Security Council meeting
today was useful in reaching that goal.
Like the Ambassador of New Zealand, I would also
like to refer to the disturbing situation regarding respect
for human rights and the serious violations that we have
seen. I trust that there will be no situation of impunity,
as has been the case in other parts of the globe.
With respect to the OSCE, I will make two brief
comments. Spain is concerned by the difficulties that
the OSCE Mission is encountering in complying with
its obligations, and we would like it to share, without
delay, the information that has been requested. Spain
also supports the extension of the OSCE mandate.
Hopefully, it will enjoy access to an area somewhat
larger than the 1 per cent to which the Ambassador of
Lithuania referred.
Lastly, any lasting and sustainable solution
necessarily involves respect for the sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine.","I thank Under-
Secretary-General Feltman and Mr. Hug for their
briefings today. It is important to note the positive
elements in those briefings, in particular that the
ceasefire had generally been holding — if imperfectly
and with frequent violations.
But as they have also told the Council, there are
serious problems on the ground. Every day Ukrainian
citizens are being killed and Ukrainian towns besieged,
and the Ukrainian economy continues to suffer, all as
a consequence of continued aggression by separatist
forces supported by Russia and in violation of the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.
As Mr. Feltman and Mr. Hug have also reminded
us, the conflict is taking a huge toll on the Ukrainian
people. Ukraine now has the dubious honour of being
among the top 10 countries for the number of internally
displaced persons and, worse, humanitarian relief
supplies are not getting through. We strongly support
Mr. Feltman’s call on both the Government of Ukraine
and the separatist forces to lift the restraints on access
to humanitarian relief.
In February, the Council adopted resolution 2202
(2015), endorsing the Minsk package of measures and
calling on the parties to implement them fully, including
an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire and the
withdrawal of heavy weapons. As we have been told,
the fulfilment of these commitments remains imperfect
at best, but, at worst, those commitments have been
disregarded. We deem the Council’s ongoing scrutiny
to be crucial.
The package of measures mandated that the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) would support the process of restoring peace,
including by monitoring and verifying compliance. Yet
the OSCE faces a major obstacle in carrying out this
role due to its inability to access conflict areas. The
monitors are obstructed from doing their job due to the
security risks associated with ceasefire violations, or
because of restrictions imposed on them.
It is imperative that all sides ensure that the OSCE
be granted the access necessary for it to fulfil its role as
envisaged in the Minsk measures. We call on Russia to
use its influence over the separatists to ensure that what
was agreed in Minsk is implemented and that the OSCE
monitors are able to perform their jobs in areas under
separatist control. The important work that OSCE
monitors are doing on the ground is often difficult and
dangerous. We commend them, but their security and
safety must continue to be protected.
New Zealand remains very concerned about the
situation in eastern Ukraine. We condemn the violence
seen this week in Marinka, and reiterate the call for
restraint made by the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office. Heavy weapons must be withdrawn from the contact line and a true ceasefire must be respected. The costs of the conflict continue to mount. A lasting solution is needed. Genuine engagement in the political process laid out in the Minsk agreements, in particular the Trilateral Contact Group and its working groups, will be critical to restoring peace and ending suffering.As detailed in the latest report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Ukrainian people continue to be subject to serious human rights abuses. Until the package of measures is implemented, including a comprehensive ceasefire, the biggest losers, as always, will be the people of Ukraine. But the other loss will be the long history of close friendship between Russia and Ukraine. That cannot be good for either country.","I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Malaysia.I join my colleagues in expressing our appreciation to Mr. Jeffrey Feltman and Mr. Alexander Hug for their comprehensive briefings.Malaysia is greatly alarmed by the recent escalation in fighting in eastern Ukraine. We have heard from the briefers on the gravity of the recent situation, which is the worst since the signing of the Minsk agreement in February 2015. We join other Council members in strongly urging all parties to fully comply with the provisions of the Minsk agreement, as stipulated in resolution 2202 (2015). We also call for the parties to cooperate fully with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission in order to enable them to carry out their
mandate as laid out in the Minsk agreement.
Malaysia welcomes the progress made thus far in
the implementation of the Minsk agreement. Until very
recently, the ceasefire has generally been respected,
despite incidents of low-intensity and sporadic fighting.
We note that both sides withdrew heavy weapons in the
early months after the signing of the Minsk agreement.
We welcome and commend the establishment of four
working groups in the context of the Trilateral Contact
Group, focusing on political, security, economic and
humanitarian issues.
On a related note, I would like to highlight that the
overall improvement in the security situation between
March and April 2015 due to the ceasefire has allowed
for the return of an international team, including
Malaysian personnel, to complete the recovery mission
for Malaysia Airlines flight MH-17. We regret the fact
that it took the Malaysian recovery team almost a year
following the downing of the aircraft to be able to enter
the crash site due to the ongoing fighting in eastern
Ukraine. As our team recently managed to collect more
remains and belongings of the victims of flight MH-17,
we were provided with a grim reminder of the tragic
humanitarian costs of the conflict in Ukraine.
As we have heard from the briefers, whatever
progress made in implementing the Minsk agreement is
still far from irreversible. Despite claims by both sides
that heavy weapons have been withdrawn, we remain
concerned that movements or presence of weapons in
violation of the Minsk agreement have been observed by
the Monitoring Mission. Inspections by the Mission of
heavy-weapon holding areas also found some weapons
missing or unaccounted for.
With the most recent clashes in Marinka, the Minsk
agreement is in real danger of unravelling. The civilian
population, in particular children, would undoubtedly
bear the brunt of an escalation in the situation. It is
heart-wrenching that as of 15 May 2015, over 160,000
children have been internally displaced in eastern
Ukraine, 68 killed and almost 200 injured. Children
continue to live with their families in bomb shelters
and to be internally displaced and deprived of basic
necessities such as water and health care.
We would remind all parties of their obligations
under international law and international humanitarian
law, particularly with regard to the protection of
civilians. We also urge all parties to allow for safe and
unrestricted humanitarian access to those in need.
The parties to the conflict must take a step
back from the spiralling violence in Ukraine and
recommit themselves to the full implementation of the
Minsk agreement. We reiterate our commitment to a
peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine based
on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations,
including respect for the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Ukraine. We appeal to the conflicting
parties not to lose the opportunity for peace once again.
I now resume my functions as President of the
Council.
I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine.","The delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela thanks you, Mr. President, for convening this briefing on Ukraine. We also welcome Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman and Mr. Alexander Hug, Deputy Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, for the information they have given us.Our country expresses its concern at the recent escalation in the armed conflict as a result of the fighting in Marinka and other cities west of Donetsk, which have led to the loss of human life and injuries. Venezuela reiterates its call on the parties to promote a peaceful political negotiated solution to this crisis. We also urge them to respect international humanitarian law, in particular the obligation to ensure the protection of civilians.We insist on the full implementation of resolution 2202 (2015), in support of the decision reached by the negotiators of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany on 12 February in Minsk. We must pursue efforts to achieve a political and diplomatic solution to the Ukrainian crisis, in which the parties would commit to working towards a firm and lasting peace. A definitive end to the hostilities therefore remains an objective that cannot be postponed. Any incident should be investigated independently on the basis of reliable evidence that should lead to the adoption of measures that meet the aspirations for peace and stability of the populations affected by the conflict.To that end, the parties must continue to demonstrate good will to achieve a joint agreement. In that regard, the mediation and efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe deserve the support of the Council, and all parties should facilitate its work. We must fulfil the agreements reached in Minsk to address the underlying causes of this conflict and respect the political and human rights of all those living in that territory, irrespective of their ethnic origin. We encourage the implementation of the provisions of the Minsk agreement that are being implemented by the
Trilateral Contact Group. In that regard, on 6 May we
were informed of the establishment of four working
groups assigned to the areas of security, political
affairs, internally displaced persons and refugees, and
humanitarian assistance, as well as economic issues
and rehabilitation.
The parties must move to restore conditions
conducive to the maintenance of dialogue, with the
support of the international community. That is the
only way to channel the concerns of all parties in order
to find a solution to this conflict. We cannot allow
to prevail a propagandistic environment that incites
confrontation and ethnic hatred, or the thousands
of accusations that contribute only to fanning the
conflict and exacerbating the situation, all of which are
preventing the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Venezuela insists on restraint in order to prevent
the dialogue from being affected by unilateral actions
that would jeopardize the peace process. In that regard,
my country rejects the application of unilateral coercive
sanctions, which violate international law and erode the
necessary trust between the parties.
Finally, we reiterate our call on all parties to
redouble their efforts in the search for a just and lasting
political solution to the benefit of their peoples.","We thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman and the Deputy Chief Monitor of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Mr. Alexander Hug, for their briefings on recent developments in the situation in Ukraine.We are deeply disturbed by the evolving turn of events in eastern Ukraine. The ceasefire brokered in Minsk is holding in general, despite difficulties with localized violations of the ceasefire and the persistent dire humanitarian situation, the increasing number of displaced people and persistent killings, as detailed in the latest report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. However, the large-scale military operations of the past few days represent a real setback to the expectations we nourished for a real consolidation of the ceasefire as a step towards tangible progress towards sustainable peace in Ukraine.As we have stated on previous occasions when this issue has been brought to the attention of the Security Council, we reiterate our recognition of the inalienable right of Ukraine to its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations. We also reaffirm our principal opposition to threats or use of force as a means of solving disputes among States.Therefore and in conclusion, we call for the immediate cessation of hostilities and urge the parties to return to the negotiating table in the framework of the Trilateral Contact Group. We call for the withdrawal of heavy weapons and the full return to the provisions of the Minsk package of measures. We further request that the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission be given access to monitor and verify the parties’ full compliance with the Minsk agreements. Too much blood has been shed and too much senseless suffering has already been endured by the Ukrainian people. We urge strict respect for the international commitments agreed to in Minsk and international guarantees that the people of Ukraine may be allowed to live in peace, freedom and security.","Let me thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting at short notice. I also thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman and Alexander Hug, Deputy Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, for their assessments of and briefings on the reality on the ground in Donbas, eastern Ukraine.When in February Russian-backed forces occupied Debaltseve in violation of existing ceasefire agreements, many worried that that violation would not be the last and that, just like the September 2014 Minsk agreements, the February 2015 agreement was also signed only to be broken. The only question was when.For some time now, the OSCE Mission has been reporting violations of the Minsk agreements and an increased movement of heavy weaponry in the territories held by the illegal militants. For example, the 3 June OSCE Mission report states that the Mission observed the movement of a large amount of heavy weapons in areas controlled by the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic — generally in a westerly direction towards the contact line — close to Marinka, preceding and during the fighting. Between 10.30 p.m. on 2 June and 5.30 a.m. on 3 June, the Mission — positioned in the Tekstilshchik area of Donetsk city, controlled by the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic — made a number of observations. It observed, inter alia, eight tracked armoured vehicles moving west, four of which were main battle tanks, at 10.30 p.m.; four main battle tanks at 11.03 p.m.; a military-type truck moving west, towing a 122-millimetre artillery piece, at 11.45 p.m.; two T-64 battle tanks moving west at 4.30 a.m.; and a column of one infantry fighting vehicle, three military trucks — one carrying an ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft gun — and two T-72 main battle tanks moving west at 4.50 a.m. Such reports have been increasingly frequent in the last few days.The military attack against the Ukrainian positions in Marinka and Krasnogorivka and the use of multiple rocket launcher systems against Pisky, Nevelske and Vodiane in the pre-dawn hours of 3 June are a most serious blow to the increasingly fragile status quo of the implementation of the Minsk agreements. Under attack, the Ukrainian military has had no choice but to inform the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission that in order to defend themselves they would need to move weapons toward the line of contact to respond to these attacks by Russian-separatist forces.Notably, the Special Monitoring Mission made several attempts to contact the leaders of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, including the self-proclaimed Prime Minister, Parliamentary Speaker, Minister of Defence and Chief of the General Staff, in order to facilitate a cessation to the fighting around Marinka. None of the calls were taken. According to the Mission staff, all were either unavailable or did not wish to speak. This is not how anyone caring for a fragile ceasefire would behave. On the contrary, such behaviour indicates a clear intent to go on the offensive in breach of all existing agreements. Notably, according to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, last week, outgoing automatic grenade launcher fire from within the city was heard, indicating that the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic is using residential areas to launch their attacks, posing deliberate and grave risks to the local population.Furthermore, the self-proclaimed leaders of the illegal armed groups do not hide their intention to seek more territory. Just recently the self-proclaimed militant boss Zakharchenko told journalists: “Slaviansk, Konstantynivka, Krasnoarmiysk are towns of the Donetsk People’s Republic”, indicating intent to take them by force. Little does it matter to him and his peers that they have no legitimate claim whatsoever on the sovereign territory of the State of Ukraine and its people, to which and to whom he and his peers, supported and armed by Russia, have done and continue to do incalculable damage.The Council has put its weight behind the Minsk agreements, unequivocally demanding their implementation in resolution 2202 (2015). Among other things, these agreements demanded full withdrawal of heavy weapons, foreign armed formations, military equipment and mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine, called for safe, free and unrestricted access for the monitors of the Special Monitoring Mission in all parts of eastern Ukraine, and stressed the release of all hostages. However, all points of the Minsk agreements have been ignored or wilfully breached by the proxy militants.Persistent flows of foreign fighters and weapons from the Russian Federation, as noted in the latest report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, continue to fuel the conflict. Ukraine’s eastern borders remain open to the supply of arms and heavy weapons. Russian soldiers have been captured on Ukrainian soil. Russian soldiers continue to die anonymously on the Ukrainian soil. Thanks to arms supplies, the illegal militants have a larger and better equipped military force than quite a few European States and NATO members; it is probably the largest illegal army ever. The comings and goings across the border of individuals in military uniforms without insignia, and most recently with the insignia of the armed forces of the Russian Federation, as reported by the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission.OSCE monitors can observe less than 1 per cent of the conflict border. If this is happening before their eyes, it is quite easy to guess what is happening in places that they cannot observe, where there are no international monitors. OSCE observers continue to be intimidated and, as noted earlier, threatened and systematically denied access by the illegal Russian militant proxies; OSCE unmanned aerial vehicles are jammed. The training, arming and financing of militants continues unimpeded. Heavy weapons have not been completely withdrawn, have been moved around a great deal and are being returned to the frontline. Ukrainian coal is being smuggled out of the country and into Russia in broad daylight while Ukraine itself suffers from a coal shortage. The so-called humanitarian convoys continue their comings and goings as if eastern Ukraine were Russia’s own backyard. Prisoner exchanges are stalling. The former United Nations peacekeeper, Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko, remains illegally imprisoned. Oleg Sentsov and other Ukrainian citizens are being illegally detained in Russia.We support the efforts of the United Nations, the OSCE and other international actors aimed at finding solutions to this conflict, including through the strengthened good offices of the Secretary-General. We call on the Secretary-General to redouble his efforts and act fast, before the conflict claims more lives and flares up once again. We also support the idea of strengthening the United Nations presence on the ground, including through the setting up of a United Nations peace support office.And yet today we reiterate our strong support for the independence, unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, with Crimea as an integral part. And yet today, because of a Russian-supported asymmetrical war accompanied by an aggressive propaganda campaign, Crimea remains occupied and Ukraine finds itself among the top 10 countries in terms of the number of internally displaced persons. The conflict has claimed some 6,500 lives, while many more — including the children of eastern Ukraine — are wounded or displaced, living in subhuman conditions and constant fear.Today, as tensions risk to explode once again into open military conflict, sadly, Russia chooses once again to blame the victim, Ukraine, for defending itself, while protecting and arming the illegal militants. We have said time and again that it is up to Russia to rein in the illegal militants and put an end to this bloody conflict which it started with the occupation of Crimea over a year ago. For its part, Ukraine has done and continues to do everything within its power to uphold the fragile ceasefire agreement. But like any country under attack, Ukraine has the right and the duty before its citizens to defend itself in the face of aggression. No one can take that right away.As the illegal militants and Russian proxies continue their blatant attempts to change facts on the ground, we must stand firm with the people of Ukraine and the United Nations Charter in condemning such criminal efforts. We call on all the parties to respect all existing agreements and the ceasefire and redouble their efforts to move forward in the Trilateral Contact Group."," I would like to thank Mr. Feltman,Under-Secretary-General, and Mr. Hug, Deputy Chief Monitor for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), for their very lucid briefings.The recent escalation of fighting in eastern Ukraine is very disturbing, as we have all heard from members of the Council this morning. Reports of the large-scale offensive by separatists in Marinka on 4 June, which resulted in the deaths of over 20 persons, underscores the fragility of the situation. There is a risk that the ceasefire of February 2015 may totally collapse if the unrelenting violations persist. We urge both sides to take deliberate and concrete steps to de-escalate the situation. We all agree that the fulcrum of such a de-escalation is the Minsk agreement. Indeed, it was designed to stabilize the situation. It is therefore vital that the parties act in accordance with their obligations under the Minsk agreement.Need we reiterate at this point, in the Council, that a military solution to this crisis is unattainable? We would like to encourage both sides to work diligently and move purposefully towards achieving a political settlement that is negotiated, with justice and peace as the guiding principles. We would like to see the conflict resolved in a manner that takes into account the concerns of the separatists while unreservedly respecting the territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty of Ukraine.We would like to pay tribute this morning to the leadership and staff of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission for their unrelenting efforts in monitoring the ceasefire. The regular media updates by the Mission have enabled us to follow closely not only its achievements but also the challenges it encounters. We encourage the parties and all stakeholders to continue to give their full cooperation to the Mission to facilitate its very essential role.","At the outset I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman and Alexander Hug, Deputy Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, for their exhaustive briefings this morning.The relative improvement of the security situation in eastern Ukraine over the past two months has had a positive effect between the parties at the political level, despite the fact that the progress achieved has been slow and limited. Nevertheless, it is our conviction that halting stabilization efforts would be inappropriate. We therefore will continue to promote stability throughout Ukrainian territory through strengthening respect for the ceasefire agreement, limiting the conflict and preventing its spread to other regions. The Security Council and the international community must therefore provide every type of support to the parties and help them overcome all obstacles and difficulties in order to implement the peace agreements reached between them.Jordan expresses its concern over the continuing violations of the ceasefire between the Ukrainian Government and the separatists, as well as the increased number of violations in recent days, together with the increase in the degree of violence in some parts of eastern Ukraine, particularly in the region of Donetsk and neighbouring towns. The continuing military confrontations and provocative acts and their expansion will only further complicate the situation and nullify the peace agreements reached between the parties. That will have an impact on all of the outstanding issues between the parties and worsen the economic, social and humanitarian situation even further. Such a situation will threaten the security and stability of the entire region. Jordan invites all parties to assume their
responsibilities and to emphasize constructive and
direct dialogue, as well as positive discussions among
them under the Normandy format, in order to reach a
peaceful settlement of the crisis. We reiterate the fact
that the only solution to the crisis depends on full
respect by all parties — particularly the separatists — of
the Minsk agreements on the ceasefire, as well as of
resolution 2202 (2015). Those agreements and all of
their provisions must be implemented globally without
exception, particularly with regard to halting the illicit
transfer of heavy weaponry and to its full withdrawal,
together with the withdrawal of foreign fighters from
eastern Ukraine.
Jordan welcomes the recent meeting held by the
Trilateral Contact Group working group. It is a positive
step forward, and it requires that all parties continue to
hold such meetings regularly, on the basis of the Minsk
agreements. Achieving a diplomatic solution and
promoting common language and points of agreement
among the parties on certain areas of some agreements
are essential and vital to reach a lasting peace that
meets the ambitions and requirements of the parties
and the stability, sovereignty and territorial integrity
of Ukraine.
Jordan appreciates all of the efforts carried out by
the OSCE in eastern Ukraine and reiterates that it has
a crucial role in monitoring borders and the ceasefire,
in addition to facilitating humanitarian access. We
call upon all parties to facilitate the work of that
organization and allow it to have access to all affected
regions in order to ensure the provision of basic services
to citizens. It is important that citizens, and refugees
in particular, avoid involvement in political diversions
or confrontations. They must be provided with the
social and humanitarian services necessary for daily
subsistence.
We pay tribute to the important role of the OSCE
in preparing local elections, and we hope that these
elections will soon be organized in eastern Ukraine,
pursuant to the Minsk agreements.","We
thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman and Mr. Alexander Hug for
their briefings on the situation in Ukraine.
We reiterate our support for the ongoing steps
taken by the Secretary-General and the United Nations
to bring an end to the situation in Ukraine, and we
support the vital work of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in mediating the
conflict and implementing the Minsk agreements. We
express our deep concern over the recent escalation
of violence in Ukraine. As we have stated on many
occasions, we believe that full compliance with the
ceasefire, monitored and verified by the Special
Monitoring Mission of the OSCE under the provisions
of the Minsk agreements, and dialogue between the
parties is the only way to achieve lasting peace.
We underscore the importance of strengthening the
rule of law and the obligation to respect the sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in
accordance with the Charter of the United Nations,
General Assembly resolution 68/262 and international
law. We have also reaffirmed on many occasions the
importance of upholding those principles, which we
consider indispensable. We regret the deterioration
of the security situation and its serious consequences
for the civilian population, which continues to suffer
human rights violations and abuses. We urge the parties
to respect human rights, including full respect for the
rights of minorities, and we call for the perpetrators of
such violations to be brought to justice. We recall that
accountability is also a way of implementing the Minsk
agreements.
The complexity of the crisis in eastern Ukraine is
not limited to the security sphere. More than 5 million
people require humanitarian assistance, and the number
of internally displaced persons and those seeking refuge
continues to increase, making it is urgent to address the
problem. It is also crucial to ensure rapid and unhindered
humanitarian access to the affected population, and all
parties must respect international humanitarian law.
The international community should help alleviate the
crisis. We appeal to donors to contribute to the 2015
Ukraine humanitarian response plan, which so far has
been funded at only 29 per cent.
We are at a critical juncture when it is imperative
that the Council reiterates a message to the parties on
the importance of creating conditions for the effective
implementation of the Minsk agreements. The facts
reveal that apprehensions about the precariousness of
effective enforcement have some merit in the context
of structural tensions. Only political dialogue within
the framework of the Minsk agreements could help to
overcome those critical cycles of violence.","I thank
Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-Secretary-General for
Political Affairs, and Mr. Alexander Hug, Deputy Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, for their briefings.Chad is deeply concerned over the resumption on 3 June of violent encounters between the Ukrainian army and separatist groups in the area of Marinka, approximately 30 kilometres from Donetsk. The fighting with heavy artillery, including Grad rocket launcers and cannons, has claimed a high number of victims on both sides. Chad strongly condemns the resurgence of violence, in violation of the Minsk agreements, which established a ceasefire and should have opened the way towards a comprehensive settlement of the conflict through dialogue. Since 12 February, incursions have been reported every day, demonstrating that the ceasefire has merely mitigated the intensity of the fighting and limited it to certain areas around Donetsk and Luhansk. Nevertheless, the increased tensions of recent days in the conflict zone raise fears of a serious threat of escalation that could thrust Ukraine into civil war on a larger scale and thereby seriously undermine the implementation of the Minsk agreements.Chad is convinced that the solution to the Ukrainian situation is a political one that largely depends on the resolve of the parties concerned to commit themselves to a genuine negotiation process in order to reach sustainable peace. To that end, we reiterate our appeal to the parties to return to calm and restraint in order to avoid a new spiral of violence and to resume the full implementation of the Minsk agreements.The human cost of the Ukrainian crisis is very heavy. More than 6,500 people have been killed, 11,000 wounded and more than 1 million displaced internally. Chad therefore urges all parties to take the path of a direct and inclusive dialogue aimed at achieving a political settlement of the crisis.In conclusion, we encourage the countries and organizations that have any influence on the parties to spare no efforts to bring them to firmly commit to seeking a lasting political solution to the crisis while respecting the sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of Ukraine, in line with the Charter of the United Nations.",,,,,,,,
S/PV.7400,06/03/2015,Maintenance of the ceasefire and human rights situation in the Donbas region and Crimea.,"I wish to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman, Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović and Mr. Ging, Director of the Coordination and Response Division of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, for their briefings. In recent days, the overall situation in eastern Ukraine has been stable, and the ceasefire has largely been maintained. Not long ago, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 2202 (2015), reflecting the firm support of the international community for the diplomatic efforts of the leaders of the Russian Federation, France, Germany and Ukraine and for a political settlement of the question of Ukraine. The top priority now is for the parties concerned to continue to implement in a comprehensive manner the 12 February Minsk agreement reached by the leaders of the Russian Federation, France, Germany and Ukraine and advance the process of political settlement. China is against any gross violation of human rights in Ukraine and any act that causes the deterioration of the humanitarian situation of the country. We also believe that a political solution is the only way to resolve the question of Ukraine. The question of Ukraine involves multiple complex and interwoven historical and contemporary issues; a comprehensive long-term solution requires a full accommodation of the legitimate rights, interests and claims of the various regions and ethnic groups in Ukraine, addressing the legitimate concerns of the parties concerned and achieving a balance in the parties’ interests. The international community should continue to increase diplomatic efforts to push for a political settlement of the crisis in Ukraine. In terms of the Council’s discussion on the question of Ukraine, China takes an open approach. We believe that the discussion should play a constructive role in easing tensions in the country. Moreover, the threat or use of unilateral sanctions all too often in international relations is not conducive to finding a fundamental solution. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries has been China’s consistent position. China’s position on the question of Ukraine has been objective and impartial. We welcome and support the Minsk agreements reached by the leaders of the Russian Federation, France, Germany and Ukraine. We call on the parties concerned to continue to make efforts to ease the situation in eastern Ukraine, with a view to achieving peace, tranquility, stability and development in Ukraine. China is willing to continue to play a constructive role towards a political settlement of the question of Ukraine. ","I would like to thank Mr. Feltman, Mr. Šimonović and Mr. Ging for their briefings. Their presentations have helped to provide valuable insight into the overall situation in Ukraine. The Security Council, through its resolution 2202 (2015), has brought all its weight to bear on the efforts to end the crisis that is the subject of the Minsk agreements, which the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is in charge of implementing. After having heard the representative of the OSCE last week (see S/PV.7391), it seems useful for the Council to have information for evaluating the overall situation. All aspects are relevant for efforts to support the crisis resolution process initiated in Minsk, which is the priority for all of us. In that regard, it is important to remember that the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements devotes an entire paragraph to humanitarian issues: The signatories have committed to ensuring “safe access, delivery, storage, and distribution of humanitarian assistance to those in need, on the basis of an international mechanism” (resolution 2202 (2015), annex I, para. 7). The human rights situation in Ukraine has continued to deteriorate in recent months. Here in the Council in mid-November (see S/PV.7311), we denounced the arrival from abroad of reinforcements in terms of weapons and fighters in support of the separatists, which fuelled a new wave of violence that peaked in early February 2015. Mr. Šimonović’s report is illuminating on that issue. Nearly 6,000 people have died since the beginning of the crisis in April 2014, including the 298 passengers on the Malaysian Airlines flight. Civilians have been the main victims of this escalation. I note in particular, and with horror, the ongoing bombing of the evacuation corridors used by people fleeing the combat zones, which has endangered the evacuation operations organized by the Ukrainian Government. Thousands of civilians, such as those in the city of Debaltseve, have found themselves trapped in combat zones. This conflagration has also given rise to an increase in the number of human rights violations, including acts of torture, summary executions and abductions. International standards have been violated by all parties to the conflict. The east of the country, which is controlled mainly by the separatists, has been turned into a zone of lawlessness. Accordingly, the report emphasizes the importance seeing the perpetrators of those crimes, including most serious crimes, found and brought to justice. In that context, the humanitarian situation requires the attention of all. The response must be coordinated. The precarious conditions in which people live in eastern Ukraine do not justify Russia’s open violations of the sovereignty of the country by bringing in so- called humanitarian convoys without notice, which are only partially monitored by the Ukrainian authorities. Finally, we remain particularly concerned about the situation of the population of Crimea under the de facto yoke of Russian law. Mr. Šimonović’s report describes a situation of arbitrariness and legal uncertainty, where civilians, especially the Tatars, experience regular violations of their human rights and are criminally charged under the Russian justice system for events that took place prior to the illegal annexation of the territory. With the signing on 12 February of the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements, a new dynamic has emerged. The ceasefire that entered into force on 15 February is now generally respected, although it remains fragile. It has helped to reduce the overall level of violence. De-escalation has been observed on the ground, and the beginning of the withdrawal of heavy weapons extends this dynamic. It is the OSCE’s responsibility to verify the withdrawal, as provided for in paragraph 3 of the Minsk package of measures. Other measures relating to human rights and the humanitarian situation must now be encouraged. In that respect, two points would establish confidence. First, with regard to all the hostages and illegally detained persons, the Minsk agreements provide for their release and exchange on the basis of the principle of “all against all”. In that regard, we call on Russia to stop holding people wrongfully detained in its territory, particularly Nadiya Savchenko. Her release would strengthen the first encouraging exchanges of prisoners that have been taking place since 12 February, including 138 Ukrainian soldiers and 52 separatist fighters on 21 February. Secondly, progress must be made quickly in the coordination of humanitarian assistance, as provided for in paragraph 7 of the Minsk package of measures. All parties to the conflict must guarantee access for international humanitarian assistance to all areas. We welcome the announcement by the Ukrainian Government of the creation of a platform for discussions between Ukrainian officials and representatives of the humanitarian community. In addition, we support the proposals of Ms. Heidi Tagliavini, Special Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office in Ukraine, to create a working group that would work to resolve all humanitarian, economic and rehabilitation issues. That group would cover the many outstanding issues: the voluntary return of internally displaced persons and refugees, the reconstruction of housing, food and medical aid, the provision to civilians of food, clothing, schools, and so on. The efforts of all sides will be needed in that regard. To give substance to the Minsk agreements, all parties must respect all of the points. Full and unconditional access and the security of the OSCE observers, as well as the transmission of information, especially to confirm the withdrawal of heavy weapons, must imperatively be guaranteed by all parties. We expect Russia to encourage the separatist elements to fully implement the commitments they made in Minsk. In addition, all parties must courageously address all of the political points of the road map drawn up in Minsk to advance towards a comprehensive and peaceful settlement of the crisis. Progress will be possible when all parties are willing to move forward. The Council may be assured of the resolute and continued commitment of France with its partners in the Normandy format and in the framework of the Council to continue on the difficult and demanding path of peace. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine. ","The last three speakers employed 50 shades of black. We would like to call on everyone to be more objective, which is in the interest of settling the conflict. However, we understand that in this case such appeals are useless. We are grateful to Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman and to the Director of the Coordination and Response Division of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Mr. John Ging, for their briefings. With regard to Mr. Ivan Šimonović, we believe that his briefing to the Security Council is inappropriate for several reasons. First, the Council has not taken a decision to establish the human rights mission in Ukraine and had not asked for a reporting line. Secondly, Mr. Šimonović already had an opportunity, just a few days ago, to address the Human Rights Council in Geneva and to convey his views to Member States. This is a classic example of a duplication of effort in the United Nations. Previous appearances by Mr. Šimonović the Security Council have led only to an excessive politicization of the issue. Objectivity was sacrificed to propaganda. It has reached the point where the Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has begun to express its views on military aspects that have nothing to do with human rights issues. That is why today we will not comment on Mr. Šimonović’s report or on his briefing. We have already done so in Human Rights Council. On 17 February, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 2202 (2015), which approves a package of measures aimed at implementing the Minsk agreements, which established a framework for peaceful settlement and a way to address the conflict in the Council. The package of measures of 12 February raised the bar for the settlement of the conflict to a more advanced stage, and it became a kind of new affirmation of the process. The document provides a comprehensive approach — from military issues to confidence-building measures — and includes constitutional reform, which should be carried out in consultation with Donetsk and Luhansk. There are also a number of other important elements, including amnesty for participants, the restoration of socioeconomic relations and humanitarian aspects. Now, thanks to resolution 2202 (2015), everything has been reinforced by the international authority of the Security Council, which in addition to the leaders of the Normandy quartet, has become a guarantor of the package of measures. The document is clear, both with regard to the sequence of the steps to be taken and the participants that must take those steps. In that regard, it is important to act in good faith and implement the steps without any attempt to rewrite them. The Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) plays a crucial role in implementing the package of measures. It is tasked with observing the process, in accordance with the parameters prescribed in the document, in an impartial and coordinated way. If the special monitoring mission needs strengthening with more observers, equipment or financing, we are ready to consider that in a more constructive manner and in more detail in the framework of the Permanent Council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna. Being both realists and optimists, we are satisfied with the positive development of the situation on the ground. The ceasefire is generally holding. The withdrawal of heavy weapons has begun. One of the parties to the conflict, the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic, has already completed that process. We hope that Kyiv will fall in line and finally withdraw its heavy equipment to the line of contact. We hope that this will help to foster a climate of trust, and that isolated violations of the ceasefire will cease. We also note the progress made in the exchange of prisoners. At the same time, progress has stalled on a number of points. On 24 February in Paris, Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Normandy quartet called on the Trilateral Contact Group to immediately establish a working group to address the remaining aspects. Unfortunately, Ukrainian authorities refuse to do that and are dragging their feet. That is alarming and counterproductive. On 3 March, after having delayed for several months, President Poroshenko signed a decree establishing a constitutional commission, which will draft changes to the Constitution. However, the process is far from transparent. According to the package of measures, constitutional reform must be carried out in coordination with representatives of Donetsk and Luhansk. Otherwise, the deep-rooted causes of the Ukrainian crisis will not be dealt with. A separate issue is the catastrophic socioeconomic and humanitarian situation in Donbas. The measures taken by Kyiv to suffocate the south-east have become a veritable blockade. Social benefits and pensions paid to Donbas residents have been cut off. Exiting and entering the area requires overcoming almost insurmountable bureaucratic obstacles. Convoys with humanitarian assistance and food are not reaching civilians, as confirmed by international organizations. Dozens of hospitals and schools have been destroyed. Kyiv recently ended the delivery of gas to Donbas. Russia is undertaking extensive efforts to meet the urgent needs of the population of Donbas. It has already 17 sent convoys with humanitarian assistance. By the way, the most recent convoy, as well as some previous ones, was fully inspected by Ukrainian customs officials at the Donetsk checkpoint. I would ask Ambassador Power to take an interest in what her Embassies in Kyiv and Moscow are doing and in why they are not providing her with such basic information, instead giving her with disinformation on this topic and many other issues related to Ukraine. Thanks to the humanitarian convoys approximately 30,000 people are being provided with food rations, 250 hospitals are receiving medical equipment and approximately 150 social service facilities have been reopened. Drinking water is being provided to 80 per cent of the population in the affected areas. We believe it is unfounded and cynically politicized to criticize us for sending those convoys. That criticism will in no way undermine our determination to help the people of Donbas. The statistics about the 1 million internally displaced persons in the territory of Ukraine is well known. However, almost as many people — 950,000 people since April 2014 — have left Ukraine and stayed in Russia. Of them more than 650,000 have requested to be granted special status. We make no distinction as to whether those people come from the east or the west of Ukraine or as to what their political views are. We are making comprehensive efforts to welcome them and provide them housing and jobs. There are some 527 temporary accommodation sites throughout 76 regions of the Russian Federation where more than 27,000 people, including nearly 9,000 children, are currently residing. Those people are being provided with humanitarian, medical and psychological support. In the medium term, the socioeconomic problems of Donbas cannot be resolved without implementing the provisions of the package of measures pertaining to the full re-establishment of relations with the rest of Ukraine, including the resumption of transfers of social benefits and pension payments and the functioning of the banking system. That work must begin without delay in the framework of the Contact Group. We have heard dozens of times in this Chamber that the Ukrainian crisis can be resolved only through political means. Today the main work is being carried out in the Normandy and Minsk formats, which are making an important contribution to achieving results that give us hope for a solution. However, against the backdrop of positive steps, we are very worried about the continuing sabre-rattling by Kyiv — statements by President Poroshenko about the expansion of the army, the delivery of a new batch of tanks to the National Guard and the armed forces, trips by Kyiv officials around the world looking for weapons, and the drafting in the United States Congress of a law to provide $1 billion for the equipping and training of Ukrainian forces. According to data we have, in Lviv oblast these days some 300 military personnel from the United States have arrived to train Ukrainian soldiers in the use of foreign equipment. Everyone knows that wherever American military appear bad things can be expected to happen. I just want to recall, for instance, that when the Saakashvili regime attacked South Ossetia, there were 127 United States military advisers working in Georgia. The result was conflict, bloodshed and destruction. Only irresponsible politicians refuse to understand what this kind of a scenario could lead to in Ukraine. ","I thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman, Assistant Secretary- General Šimonović and Director Ging for their timely briefings today. We share the briefers’ grave concern at the situation in eastern Ukraine. This week the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that more than 6,000 people have been killed since April 2014. In that time, over 15,000 people have been wounded, and more than 1.5 million have fled their homes. It should trouble us all that these grim milestones have been met in less than one year and in spite of successive ceasefires. Behind those statistics lies a worrying and escalating humanitarian crisis that has further undermined the human rights of all those living in eastern Ukraine. I can understand why the representative of Russia does not want to discuss the human rights situation in the country because the latest report by the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine details a growing level of violations and abuse, including reports of arbitrary arrests, summary executions, torture and enforced disappearances. The report details indiscriminate shelling of populated areas, including deliberate attacks by Russian-backed separatists on civilians being evacuated through Ukrainian- controlled routes, and it highlights the human cost of the fighting — overburdened centres for internally displaced persons, collapsing social services and a growing scarcity of food, water and heating. The violence is having a disproportionate effect on the most vulnerable, with women, children and the elderly increasingly caught up in the fighting. Thousands remain trapped in volatile locations like Debaltseve. Hospitals, schools and kindergartens have been deliberately shelled, and disturbing reports of sexual violence are on the rise. We call on both sides to respect international law, to ensure the safety and security of all in the region and to take active steps to ensure accountability for any violations and abuses of human rights. Sadly, investigations have been hindered by the separatists’ refusal to grant access to the territory they control. We urge Russia to use its influence to overcome that situation. More must also be done, as agreed in Minsk on 12 February, to ensure the exchange of all hostages and unlawfully detained persons who remain in captivity. That includes Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko, being held in solitary confinement, who has been on an extended hunger strike. Recent reports indicate that she has had to suspend her hunger strike after 83 days without food amid serious concerns for her health. As part of the agreement, Russia committed to releasing all prisoners, and yet Ms. Savchenko and many others remain in captivity. That is a clear violation of the Minsk agreements. I would like to ask the Russian representative here today to explain to the Security Council why Ms. Savchenko is still being held. I would also like to remind the Russian Federation authorities that while Ms. Savchenko remains in their custody they are fully responsible for her health and well-being. One year on from the illegal annexation of Crimea, we must be clear in our condemnation today of what the United Nations describes as “systematic human rights violations affecting mostly Crimean Tatars and those who opposed the March ‘referendum’”. The report details arrests, arbitrary detention and deportation of Crimean Tatar activists, denying them their freedom of religion and belief, their right to free expression and their right to peaceful assembly. The continued denial of access to Crimea to the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities is of particular concern. We must send a united message today on the issue of access. The Minsk agreement calls for the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to those in need. It calls for the OSCE to observe the withdrawal of heavy weapons, the border and the ceasefire. None of that can be achieved unless the Russian-backed separatists grant free and unfettered access to the territory they control. We welcome Ukrainian President Poroshenko’s statement this week that the OSCE will be granted access by the separatists to 10 locations in the east. I look forward to Russia’s confirmation that it will be support this commitment and that it will use all its influence to improve access for humanitarian deliveries. Russian so-called humanitarian convoys remain of grave concern. Some are clearly being used as cover for the delivery of military supplies. Russian military hardware remains in eastern Ukraine despite the agreement at Minsk to withdraw foreign military formations. The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine details credible reports of “a continuing influx of heavy and sophisticated weaponry to armed groups in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as foreign fighters, including from the Russian Federation.” The OSCE reported on Wednesday that an 83-vehicle convoy crossed the border from Russia at Donetsk. The Ukrainian Government has made clear that it has not authorized such convoys. They are therefore a clear violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and of international law. Should Russia wish to support the humanitarian effort, I urge it to donate money to the United Nations aid programme. Unless Russia changes its approach, we will have no choice but to maintain sanctions and continue our condemnation of Russia’s flagrant disregard for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and the human rights of its people. ","We continue to believe that compliance with the September Minsk agreements and the February implementation package provides a road map to peace in Ukraine. For the first time since the Minsk implementation package was signed, on 12 February, we have seen a reduction in violence. Of course, no one forgets that Russia and the separatists they have trained, armed, directed and fought alongside started violating their commitments under the package from the first minutes and hours after the deal was signed, by laying siege to Debaltseve, a city dozens of kilometres beyond the contact line, with their deadly and indiscriminate pummelling. Violations started on day one, and violations of the ceasefire continue in a number of places, particularly outside Mariupol, where Russian-backed separatists have engaged in intense fighting, attacking the village of Shyrokyne in recent days. Unfortunately, although the violence has decreased, there has been only partial compliance with the Minsk implementation package. As the members of the Council know, the package calls for “an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire”, not a gradual and partial reduction of fire. It does not say that Russian-backed separatists can continue to shell, engage in sniper fire or use barrel and rocket artillery; yet they have carried attacks using all such methods in recent days. Since 20 February, Russian separatist attacks such as those have killed 15 Ukrainian military personnel and wounded nearly 100 more. A second condition in the Minsk implementation package is full, unfettered access to the entire conflict zone for monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). While there have been occasional instances when the OSCE’s Special Monitoring Mission has been stopped at Ukrainian checkpoints, the restrictions placed on the Mission by Russia and the separatists are documented as widespread. Just as Russia and Russian-backed separatists prevented the Mission from going to Debaltseve while those forces carried out their vicious attack, recent Mission reports chronicle repeated, persistent obstruction from Russian-backed separatists — obstruction that includes even threatening to kill OSCE monitors. To date, the separatists have granted the monitors sporadic access, limited to certain roads when and where it suits them. As we have asked before, the question bears asking again: who obstructs an objective observer other than someone who has something to hide from an unbiased eye? The Minsk implementation package also calls for a full pull-back of all heavy weapons. That, too, has not happened. Shortly after the package was signed, the OSCE’s chief monitor sent a letter to all the signatories requesting that they provide information on what heavy weapons were present in eastern Ukraine, where they were, which routes would be used to withdraw them and where they would be located after being withdrawn. Russia has not replied, as though if it pretends it has no heavy weapons in Ukraine, we will forget all the tanks, GRAD missiles and other heavy weapons we have watched Russia send across the border. All signatories to the Minsk agreements and the implementation package — Ukraine, on the one side, and Russia and the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic, on the other — are responsible for pulling back heavy weapons. The OSCE must have unfettered, unconditional access in order to verify the withdrawal. Two days ago, Russia sent its seventeenth so-called humanitarian convoy into Ukraine, once again denying international observers and Ukrainian border guards the right to conduct a full and complete inspection of its contents. Russian convoys, which should be coming out of Ukraine, are instead going in. If those convoys are carrying humanitarian assistance, why not allow a full inspection? The ceasefire weapons pull-back and OSCE verification, neither of which is complete, are among just the immediate steps to be taken in the implementation package. In addition to that, all of the Minsk agreements to date have called for the release of all hostages by all sides. Nadiya Savchenko and other Ukrainians being held in Russia are hostages, just as surely as are those being kept in basements in Donetsk and Luhansk. Again, we call on Russia to release Nadiya Savchenko, who has been on hunger strike for more than 80 days, as well as her Ukrainian counterparts. That is something Russia can do today. As we have seen before, the separatists have an established track record of using a lull in the fighting to regroup, re-arm and re-supply. Russia supports that process by providing an unlimited supply of guns and weaponry. The United States, and the rest of the world, hopes that will not be the case this time. We are carefully watching what happens in Shyrokyne, a town just east of the strategic port city of Mariupol, which many fear will be the next target of the separatists and Russian military. The devastating consequences of this conflict have been brought into sharp relief by the most recent report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. More than 1.7 million people have been displaced and more than 5,800 killed — a casualty count that does not include the hundreds of bodies found after Russian-backed separatists finished their deadly siege of Debaltseve. A report from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs at the end of last month stated that 500 bodies had been found in houses and basements at the end of the siege — 500 bodies. Homes and basements where people took shelter from the endless barrage of Russian-made mortars and rockets as they rained down on the city’s residents, who could not escape. Weeks into the siege, at the end of January, the self-declared leader of the Russian-backed separatists announced that anybody who left would be in the interlocking field of fire of their artillery. From that day, he said, the road would be under fire. Those inside were therefore left with a choice between risking their lives by staying or risking their lives by leaving. Civilians were killed doing both, and, I repeat, 500 bodies were found in homes and basements where people had taken shelter. The casualties and the displaced are one of the devastating consequences of this conflict. Another, and one we rarely speak about in the Council any more, is the ongoing illegal occupation and attempted annexation of Crimea by a permanent member of the Council. Crimea is important not only because it constitutes a continued violation of the territorial integrity of a sovereign nation — a violation orchestrated in Moscow and dressed up in a sham referendum — but also because it offers a preview of the kind of rule we can expect in the other parts of Ukraine seized by those who see themselves as part of Novorossiya. Let me give just one example of what it is like to live in that world, from a long list of repressive practices documented in the aforementioned February human-rights report of the United Nations, part of the relentless persecution of the Crimean Muslim Tatar minority. According to the report, on 29 January 2015, the de facto authorities arrested Ahtem Ciygoz, the Deputy Chairman of the Tatar Mejlis, the Tatars’ representative council. He was charged, under the Russian criminal code, with having participated in a “mass disturbance” for protesting against what was then the imminent Russian occupation, which ended in a clash with pro-Russian demonstrators. On 7 February, another Crimean Tatar was detained on the same charges. Both men are charged with violating Russian law, even though Russian law had not even taken effect at the time that they participated in the protest. Yesterday the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media released a statement saying that media freedom in Crimea was at an all time low. Among other violations, she reported that, “Journalists from at least 13 independent media outlets, free lance journalists and bloggers have been threatened, assaulted, physically attacked, banned from entry, interrogated and kidnapped; their equipment confiscated or damaged.” The Russian Federation occupies territory, unilaterally attempts to annex it and then retroactively and arbitrarily applies its laws to those who dared to question its take-over as it was occurring. It does not get much more Orwellian than that. As anyone who has read the human rights report knows, that is just one in a long list of repressive tactics, including torture, enforced disappearances and targeted political killings that have defined Russia’s occupation. It is to avoid an Orwellian world like that, where we talk of peace while undermining it, that we must ensure that the Minsk agreements are implemented. The Council members around this table must confront the situation on the ground as it exists, rather than as we wish it were. Peace will not come from more words, and there have been so many words in this Chamber. It will come from the long-awaited and faithful implementation of the many agreements that have been entered into, and renewed respect for the territorial integrity of a State Member of the United Nations. ",,,,,,,,,,,"I thank you, Mr. President, for having convened this meeting to discuss the current situation in Ukraine. It is our hope that under your presidency the Ukraine issue will progress further towards a resolution. I thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Mr. Ivan Šimonović and Mr. John Ging for their important and timely briefings. Unfortunately, the facts mentioned today show that the Minsk agreements of 12 February this year, and of 5 and 19 September of last year, have not been implemented in full.
The armed and pro-Russian groups are continuing their attacks on positions and control centres of the Ukrainian armed forces, as well as on civilian residences. Since the ceasefire of 15 February, the militants have carried out over 750 attacks. As a result, the Ukrainian armed forces have lost 64 soldiers and 341 have been wounded. On the last day alone, terrorists attacked positions of the Ukrainian military 58 times. Since the launching of the anti-terrorist operation last year, 1,541 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and 6,226 wounded.
The Russian side and pro-Russian separatists launched an offensive on the city of Debaltseve, which has already become a symbol of Russia’s flagrant violation of international humanitarian and human rights law. As Ambassador Apakan, head of the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), informed the Council last Friday, “This was an attempt to create new facts on the ground, and so to change the basis on which the latest package of measures had been agreed. These attacks were against the letter and the spirit of the Minsk agreements.” (S/PV.7395, p.3)
After Debaltseve, Mariupol is the most likely target of an attack. Furthermore, with the start of the ceasefire, the self-proclaimed leaders of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic demonstrated their reluctance to create conditions that would allow the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to effectively monitor and verify the ceasefire regime and the withdrawal of heavy weapons.
For our part, we remain fully committed to the implementation of the Minsk agreements, including those reached in September 2014. We believe that they remain the road map for seeking a peaceful settlement of the conflict. The Ukrainian armed forces have strictly followed the order issued by the President of Ukraine to implement the ceasefire as of 15 February. Ukraine has continued to withdraw its heavy weapons from the line of contact. At the present time, 150-millimetre artillery weapons have already been removed from the line of contact. Grad missile operations were halted yesterday and the Uragan systems are withdrawing today.
That step was carried out under OSCE monitoring and verification. But the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the Donbas by the Ukrainian Army and the Russian-backed fighters should be carried out simultaneously. Moreover, it must be precisely coordinated and monitored by the OSCE. Ukraine is committed to continuing to provide all necessary assistance to the OSCE in Ukraine in that regard. We once again call on the Russian Federation and the Russian-backed mercenaries to immediately fulfil their obligations under the Minsk agreements and Security Council resolution 2202 (2015). We demand that the Russian Federation influence its agents in eastern Ukraine to guarantee all of the conditions necessary for the OSCE to fulfil its duties in the field.
We find it difficult to trust the words of the Russian side; they have made so many statements. We have lost confidence even in their actions, because there has been no real action; only the pretence of such. We await the outcome of the implementation of the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements of September 2014 and of February 2015.
(spoke in English)
The latest report of the Human Rights Mission in Ukraine presented today by Mr. Šimonović dismisses any internal human rights pretext for the ongoing external aggression in Ukraine. On the contrary, it clearly indicates a continuing flow of heavy weaponry and foreign fighters from the Russian Federation into the areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions controlled by illegal armed groups. It is crystal clear that an immediate end to the Russian aggression in the Donbas and the occupation of the Crimea is an indispensable precondition for ensuring respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the Crimea and the Donbas regions in eastern Ukraine. At the same time, Ukraine is doing its best to take forward a human-rights agenda, including through developing a National Human Rights Strategy, which envisages elaborating a National Action Plan for Human Rights.
By any standard, Russia’s detention and ill-treatment of Ms. Nadiya Savchenko constitute a grave violation of human rights. We remind the Russian side that at the Normandy format summit in Minsk on 12 February it was agreed that all hostages and illegally detained persons must be released within 19 days. The agreed measure fully covers the case of Nadiya Savchenko. We call on Russia to honour its commitments by immediately releasing Savchenko and all other Ukrainian hostages.
My delegation is grateful to numerous States and organizations for their clear and strong statements in support of the immediate freeing of Savchenko. We reiterate our protest against the continued attempts by Russian authorities to fabricate new trumped-up charges against other Ukrainian political prisoners in Russia, among whom are Oleg Sentsov and Oleksandr Kolchenko.
A year ago Russia launched its full-fledged aggression against Ukraine. There is no need to remind members of the Council how the occupation and annexation of Crimea was conducted. What is the human rights situation in that occupied territory at the moment? The implementation of Russian laws, which contravenes General Assembly resolution 68/262, has had serious human rights implications. We have witnessed the arrests and detentions of Crimean Tatar activists on totalitarian charges relating to the demonstrations and activities of their civil society organizations, and media outlets are being disrupted on the false grounds of preventing so-called extremist activities. The arrests, prosecutions and deportations of Crimean Tatar leaders, including People’s Deputy of Ukraine Mustafa Dzhemilev, the Chairman of the Crimean Tatar Mejlis, Refat Chubarov, and his Deputy, Ahtem Ciygoz, are politically motivated. Over 10,000 have been forced to leave Crimea for mainland Ukraine. It has been the most serious blow to the Crimean Tatars since the Stalinist deportation.
Those and other outrageous acts must be immediately dealt with by the Council. Under no circumstances can the United Nations accept that Russia has turned Crimea into an isolated military camp and its residents into recluses. We encourage the United Nations to be more persistent in ensuring the implementation of international human-rights treaties and the recommendations of the Human Rights Mission in Ukraine by Russia and the administration installed in Crimea by the occupying Power. They must also allow access by missions of international organizations to the peninsula seeking to monitor the observance of human rights.
More than 6,000 deaths, many thousands of injured people and over one million internally displaced persons — that is the human toll that Ukraine is paying for Russia’s intervention. The Ukrainian Government is doing its best to cope with the unfolding humanitarian crisis. We appreciate the United Nations humanitarian efforts, namely, the launch last week, jointly with the Government, of the 2015 humanitarian response plan. The Government of Ukraine devotes great attention to the people who now live in areas temporarily uncontrolled by the Ukrainian authorities. The Ukrainian Government has done everything possible, from supplying gas and electricity to providing humanitarian assistance. Russian-backed militants impede, through shelling and other threats, the efforts of Ukrainian personnel to repair gas pipelines and electricity lines. As for the Ukrainian Government’s humanitarian assistance, most of it has not, to date, reached non-Government controlled territories, owing to the refusal of the Russian-backed terrorists to provide safe and unhindered access for humanitarian deliveries and personnel. On 4 February, there was an unfortunate explosion at one of the biggest mines in Donetsk. Our special rescue team was just 45 kilometres away from the mine, and the Ukrainian Government immediately offered to send it there to help extract the miners from below ground. The separatists senselessly and mercilessly refused to let the team in.
For its part, the Russian side continues to send so-called humanitarian convoys without the involvement of the International Committee of the Red Cross and fully excluding the Ukrainian side. What the Russian delegation stated today on the issue of the humanitarian convoys is nothing but an attempt to misinform the international community and the Security Council. I should like to remind the Council that it is not only a serious violation of international and national law; it is a crime.
(spoke in French)
In conclusion, a year ago, Russia became like a blind painter who has decided to recolour the international landscape according to his own taste. That is why a series of black marks have appeared, blackening the reputation of the Charter of the United Nations. That black paint was applied by Russia’s hand alone. What remains for us to do is to try to remove those black marks on the Council and everywhere else. I would like to thank all members of the Security Council for their support to Ukraine.          I would like to make a general observation. Listening to the Russian delegation since last year and here again today, I must repeat what I have been saying since last March. Russia is an arsonist who is trying to play the role of the fire safety inspector. As long as it seek to play such a role, no constructive dialogue will be possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I wish to thank Mr. Feltman, Mr. Šimonović and Mr. Ging for their briefings and express my gratitude to the delegation of Lithuania for having called for this meeting. I would like to particularly thank Lithuania because Spain is very supportive of the Security Council’s role in closely monitoring the implementation of the Minsk agreement on the basis of resolution 2202 (2015). All of us here agree that the conflict in Ukraine can be resolved only by political means. The Minsk accord, facilitated by Germany and France, to which the parties agreed and which was endorsed by the Security Council, can serve as a tool for us to achieve a solution. We need to support it in a decisive, and unanimous way.
A new high-level meeting of the participants in the Normandy format is convening today in Berlin, with Ambassadors Tagliavini and Apakan in attendance on behalf of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in order to continue providing assistance aimed at advancing the process. The Security Council should also support that process. Spain welcomes the progress achieved in the first few weeks after the entry into force of the ceasefire agreement, including the first steps in the withdrawal of heavy weapons and the exchange of prisoners.
However, progress remains weak and inadequate, as clearly described by Under-Secretary-General Feltman. I believe, as he does, that we really need to take advantage of this window of opportunity. We urge respect for the ceasefire, without exception and pursuant to the agreed conditions, and the implementation of the other provisions of the Minsk agreement in a uniform and condition-free manner. We also appeal to Russia to use all its influence to demand that the rebel groups immediately and strictly implement the agreements and thereby comply with its obligations as a signatory of the Minsk agreement. We also call on Ukraine to continue moving forward in fulfilling the obligations undertaken in Minsk, including the non-military aspects of the agreement.
We are concerned about the difficulties that the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine continues to face in fulfilling the tasks entrusted to it under the agreement. We therefore urge the parties to work together with the Mission and to provide it forthwith with the full information it requires. In recent days, the Council has repeatedly expressed its support for the important role that the OSCE plays. I think that we must stress the importance of the agreement. Spain has proposed extending the mandate of the Special Monitoring Mission and providing it with the necessary human and material resources. We have heard with great concern the description of the humanitarian situation reported by Mr. Ging. Assistance to the population in need should be a top priority for everyone. We need to reject the politicization and exploitation of the situation. The effective distribution of humanitarian assistance should be a common goal that should be implemented in a coordinated way and not unilaterally. I appeal specifically to Russia to ensure the effective distribution of aid and the due observance of international law and the necessary restoration of trust between the parties and to coordinate its humanitarian assistance with the Ukrainian authorities and the competent international authorities. Spain suggests that we consider the possibility of setting up a specific mechanism that would make it possible, perhaps with the support of independent humanitarian actors, to facilitate and accelerate the delivery of aid to those in need with full respect for humanitarian principles.
We have also listened intently and with great concern to Mr. Šimonović’s briefing. We again see the dramatic impact of the conflict in terms of its undermining human rights and international humanitarian law. That has been particularly severe since January in the areas under the control of rebel groups. On that point, I would like to express, as have other delegations, a special thought for Nadiya Savchenko, whose hunger strike is of great concern to us. We request that she be released immediately.
Also of particular concern is the description of the situation in the autonomous republic of Crimea. Its population, according to the report, is subject to systematic violations of its rights, especially those people who belong to the Tatar community. Spain would like to recall the content of General Assembly resolution 68/262. The report submitted by Mr. Šimonović recalls that the implementation of the laws of the Russian Federation in respect of the population of Crimea not only contravenes that resolution but also has certain implications that negatively impact human rights. Any lasting and sustainable solution must be based on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.","I thank Mr. Feltman, Mr. Ging and Mr. Šimonović for their excellent briefings, which only serve to emphasize that, if the Security Council is to perform its role of scrutinizing the situation in Ukraine, it must continue to receive regular and reliable information, such as that which we have just heard. We also compliment Lithuania for its initiative in requesting those briefings.
What we now know about the human rights situation in Ukraine is truly distressing, in particular the reports of severe violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, including the indiscriminate shelling of civilians, which New Zealand has previously condemned, and does so again today. Vulnerable populations are subject to grave abuses; they strive just to maintain a precarious existence, all the while seeking safety. We think, in particular, of the plight of the disabled, who are often overlooked in these situations. Moreover, today there are 1 million displaced persons in Ukraine; 12 months ago, there were none. There are 5 million in need of humanitarian relief; 12 months ago, there were none.
A sharp increase in casualties coincided with the dramatic escalation of hostilities of recent months, the only mitigating factor being that the worst reports generally predate the ceasefire recently agreed in Minsk. While there are indications that the situation has started to improve since that ceasefire, we as the Security Council must do everything possible to maintain that momentum. We must in particular address the gaps in information referred to by Under-Secretary-General Feltman, and we must, to use his words, make the process irreversible. We can only hope that the events of late 2014 and the early part of this year represent the lowest point of the humanitarian and human rights situation in Ukraine.
In the February open debate on the topic (see S/PV.7389), my Minister of Foreign Affairs raised New Zealand’s concerns about the veto. We were not alone in that, with some Member States also mentioning paragraph 3 of Article 27 of the Charter of the United Nations. Without repeating those comments, New Zealand emphasizes that, where parties to a conflict know that the Security Council is unable to act, there is much less incentive for compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law. We see the sad reality of that every day in Ukraine.
New Zealand urges those involved in this conflict to deliver on their Minsk commitments, not least with a genuine and comprehensive ceasefire. Until that has been achieved, the humanitarian crisis and the violations that have been described to us today will persist, more people will suffer, more blood will be shed, and more lives will be lost. Under international human rights law, all parties have an obligation to ensure that civilians are protected. Where civilians seek to escape conflict areas so as to get to safety, they must be allowed to do so, not be trapped as Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović described to us, and certainly not threatened by separatist artillery. Humanitarian aid must reach the affected populations. All involved must do everything within their power to ensure its delivery without let or hindrance. International norms on the protection of humanitarian actors must also be respected.
As we have just heard that the situation for ordinary people in Ukraine remains very dangerous indeed. The observation of the ceasefire remains imperfect. Significant civilian populations remain at very high risk. Much is needed to ensure their safety and to protect them from human-rights violations. New Zealand reiterates the Security Council’s recent unanimous call for the full implementation of the Minsk package, including a comprehensive ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons. All of this must be monitored and verified by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. We also call once again on Russia, as a party to the Minsk agreements on the ceasefire and with indisputable influence in this matter, to ensure that the separatists honour that which has been agreed. Those are the essential steps on the path to a long-term political solution and to the restoration of peace in Ukraine, and, as such, they must be delivered.","I thank you for convening this meeting, Mr. President. We wish to thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Mr. John Ging and Mr. Ivan Šimonović for their respective briefings.
At the outset, Malaysia would like to express its sincere condolences to the families of the victims of the coal mine accident in Zasyadko in eastern Ukraine. The incident, which resulted in dozens of casualties, has further exacerbated the already grim situation in the Donetsk region. We call on the parties to the conflict to give full cooperation to the relevant authorities for the rescue and recovery effort.
As is normally the case, the civilian population bears the biggest brunt and pays the highest price in any conflict. The Ukraine crisis is no exception. In a matter of one year, Ukraine went from being a country without a single displaced person to one having over 1 million of its people displaced from eastern Ukraine and Crimea. Of the 1 million, 1 in 3 internally displaced people in Ukraine is a child. Currently, an estimated 5 million people in eastern Ukraine are in need of humanitarian assistance. Over 6,000 people have been killed in the conflict, including the 298 passengers on flight MH-17, a tragic incident that was a direct consequence of the Ukraine conflict.
Malaysia condemns indiscriminate attacks against civilians in the strongest terms. We are alarmed to learn that attacks that seem to intentionally target civilians in residential areas have further intensified in recent months, including in Volnovakha, Mariupol and the city of Donetsk. As reported by the human rights mission in Ukraine, the fighting and indiscriminate shelling have severely damaged civilian property and vital infrastructure, leaving civilians without electricity, gas, heating, water or food. We also condemn the attacks against hospitals, schools and kindergartens, carried out in stark disregard for international humanitarian law and civilians’ lives. We repeat our call for an independent investigation into those incidents, so as to bring those responsible for gross violations of international human rights and humanitarian law to justice.
Malaysia is deeply concerned by the allegations of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in Ukraine. Reports of the arbitrary detentions of civilians, torture and enforced disappearances committed against both sides of the conflict must be investigated to prevent impunity. We regret the lack of progress in ensuring accountability for the grave human rights violations, such as those that occurred during the Maidan protest in Kyiv and Odessa last year.
We deplore the attacks against journalists in Ukraine, particularly in eastern Ukraine and Crimea. Over the past year, at least 78 journalists have been held by armed groups, and at least 60 attacks were carried out against media offices. We call on the parties to respect the right to the freedoms of opinion, expression and peaceful assembly. We also view with concern the targeting of religious minorities in the areas controlled by armed groups, as reported by the human rights mission in Ukraine.
Since the ceasefire went into effect on 15 February 2015, fighting has generally decreased in the Donbas region. We also welcome the progress made in the withdrawal of heavy weapons on both sides. At this point, however, the ceasefire remains fragile, and the progress made thus far is far from irreversible. We urge the parties to the conflict not to miss the opportunity for peace once again and to ensure full compliance with the provisions of the Minsk agreements. We also call on both sides to cooperate fully with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine so as to enable the mission to carry out its mandate, including to monitor and verify the ceasefire and the heavy weapons withdrawals.
Malaysia commends the tireless efforts and commitment on the part of various organizations, including the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, to provide humanitarian assistance to those affected by the Ukraine crisis. With the ceasefire in effect, we hope attention can now be focused on intensifying humanitarian assistance in an environment that would ensure the safety and security of humanitarian personnel. We urge all parties to allow safe and unrestricted humanitarian access and to remove bureaucratic impediments that could create barriers to deliveries of immediate and effective humanitarian aid. We reiterate our position that humanitarian assistance must be carried out in accordance with international law and international humanitarian law and respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
In conclusion, we wish to reflect on the priority task facing the Chairperson of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is to rebuild trust and confidence in Europe, in particular in view of the worst crisis the region has faced since the end of the Cold War. We believe that the Minsk agreements provide an excellent opportunity for the parties in conflict to take a step back from the spiralling violence in Ukraine and recommit themselves to a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Full adherence to the Minsk agreements by both sides would constitute a first step towards the rebuilding of trust and confidence, hopefully leading to a sustainable political solution to the conflict. ","At the outset, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on presiding over the work of the Security Council during the month of March. You may count on the full cooperation of my delegation in the pursuit of the objectives inherent to the Council’s work. We also thank the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Mr. Ivan Šimonović, and the Director of the Coordination and Response Division of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Mr. John Ging, for their briefings. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela optimistically notes that the prospects for a political solution in Ukraine have continued to grow, especially following the adoption of resolution 2202 (2015) by the Security Council in support of the decision agreed by the representatives of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany on 12 February in Minsk. We underscore the need for the agreements to receive the support of the international community. We firmly hope that the parties will respect the ceasefire so that the agreements can be fully implemented.
We would like to express our concern regarding the more than 6,000 deaths, 14,740 wounded and 1 million internally displaced persons that have been reported, as well as the fragile situation in which civilians find themselves in the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk. We therefore reiterate the need for the parties strictly to observe what was agreed in Minsk on 12 February regarding the protection of civilians and to support a process addressing the humanitarian situation. We reiterate our rejection of violence, ethnic and political persecution, and any form of terrorist act, by whosoever committed and for whatsoever motivation. We call on the parties to refrain from actions that threaten the aspirations for peace and stability of the populations affected by the conflict.
Venezuela supports the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes and welcomes the work being carried out by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to support the effective implementation of the Minsk agreements, including the withdrawal of heavy weaponry by the parties concerned, which has already begun, as stated Mr. Ertuğrul Apakan, head of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine on 27 February.
Without a doubt, the human rights situation throughout the region is cause for concern. And while that is the focus of our discussion at this meeting, I cannot fail to stress the importance of seeking a political and diplomatic solution to the conflict. The Security Council must therefore support the effective implementation of resolution 2202 (2015) and the full implementation of the Minsk agreements of 12 February in an impartial and transparent manner and without ulterior motives.","We thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman, Director John Ging of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and Assistant Secretary-General Ivan Šimonović for their briefings illustrating the political and diplomatic developments aimed at putting an end to the conflict in Ukraine, as well as the situation on the ground, the ceasefire agreed to in Minsk, the dire humanitarian situation endured by the Ukrainians and the alarming human rights situation facing the country.
As a matter of principle, Angola supports the peaceful resolution of conflicts through dialogue and negotiations, strict adherence to the principles of international law, and respect for the sovereignty, independence, non-interference and territorial integrity of all States. Angola reiterates its full support for the implementation of the package of measures agreed to in Minsk on 12 February. We believe that a permanent ceasefire will allow for the overall implementation of the Minsk agreement and ultimately, the establishment of peace in Ukraine.
We are deeply concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Ukraine, where over all, since the beginning of the conflict in mid-April 2014, almost 6,000 people have been killed and almost 15,000 wounded. We regret that over 1 million people are reported to be internally displaced. This is a situation that must stop and the Ukrainian people must be allowed to live with one another in peace and security.
We call once again on the parties to the conflict to respect the ceasefire and to implement speedily and in good faith the package of measures under the Minsk agreements. Having been endorsed by the Security Council in its resolution 2202 (2015), the agreement carries special weight resulting from the Council’s authority in matters pertaining to international peace and security. In addition, the agreements’ endorsement by the Council’s unanimous adoption of that resolution confers additional responsibilities on the Council and on the parties to the conflict to enforce the ceasefire and the Minsk agreements.","I thank you, Sir, for having convened today’s meeting. I would also like to thank the three briefers for their valuable and sobering contributions. It is hard to disagree with the statements made by Under-Secretary-General Feltman and Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović that the window of opportunity is very small and may be closing very fast.
Following the diplomatic efforts in the Normandy format aimed at finding a solution to the Ukrainian conflict, a package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements of 5 and 19 September 2014 was agreed upon on 12 February. The Security Council put its weight behind th0se agreements by adopting resolution 2202 (2014), on 17 February.
Since then, some positive developments have taken place, including the initial exchange of prisoners and a significant reduction in the death toll. However, further steps are urgently needed. All illegally detained persons must be released, including the Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko, who spent more than 80 days on a hunger strike and whose health is close to a point of no return.
Serious concerns remain regarding the verification of the withdrawal of heavy weaponry and continuing instances of ceasefire violations, including near Mariupol and Donetsk airport.
We note the assessment by the Special Monitoring Mission that attacks on Government-controlled towns east of Mariupol may indicate an attempt to test the eastern defences of the city. We stress that any attempts by the Russia-backed militants to seek to gain control of additional territory will be a clear breach of the Minsk agreements and will seriously undermine all efforts to promote a sustainable political solution.
Monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) continue to face severe restrictions. Russia-backed armed groups continue to deny access, including to Shyrokyne and Kruzhylivka; they also continue to harass and threaten the personnel of the Special Monitoring Mission. That is clearly unacceptable and a violation of the Minsk agreements and their implementation measures.
The OSCE Mission has not been provided with the requested detailed information, including the inventory of weapons, withdrawal routes and concentrations points, as per the Minsk agreements. Valid questions therefore remain regarding whether the illegal militants are withdrawing their weaponry or merely regrouping under the guise of doing so.
The situation is further aggravated by the fact that OSCE border-monitoring activities remain restricted to 40 metres out of some 400 kilometres. As we know, Russia has repeatedly blocked efforts to expand border monitoring.
It is paramount that Russia stop destabilizing the situation in eastern Ukraine and stop supporting illegal armed groups operating there. Its soldiers must be withdrawn from the territory of Ukraine. It must put an end to the movement of mercenaries across its borders into Ukrainian territory and stop support to the illegal militants. Russia should also use its influence with the illegal armed groups to ensure that the ceasefire is fully and unconditionally respected and that the withdrawal of the heavy weapons can be duly monitored.
The OSCE Monitoring Mission should be provided full and unhindered access to all areas. It must be able to exercise its mandate independently, without obstruction or interference. We look forward to the early extension of the Mission’s mandate for a 12-month period. Adequate financing and resourcing must be ensured for the Mission to carry out its mandate.
Civilians have borne the brunt of this conflict, which started a year ago with the illegal annexation of Crimea in blatant breach of the Charter of the United Nations. The false pretext of defending the rights of Russian speakers was used to invade Crimea and promote separatism in eastern Ukraine. While fighting imagined human rights violations, Russia and the illegal militants it supports have caused a real humanitarian crisis and real and dramatic human rights violations in the regions affected by the illegal actions.
Normal life in those regions has been disrupted, leading to displacement, destruction and deaths. The numbers were given by John Ging of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). At least 1 million have resettled within the country, placing a heavy burden on the authorities as well as on local communities. Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović has spoken about that. The humanitarian crisis is most acute, aggravated by the cold winter. Russia and the illegal armed groups it supports bear full responsibility for the devastation that has befallen Ukraine.
We welcome the efforts of OCHA, United Nations agencies and other international organizations aimed at alleviating the suffering of the people in eastern Ukraine. It is imperative that all humanitarian actors should be provided unfettered access to all affected areas for a prompt and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance. Humanitarian assistance should be provided in line with international law and in full respect of Ukraine’s sovereignty. Russia’s so-called humanitarian convoys remain a cause of concern, as they are operating in violation of the accepted norms of humanitarian assistance and in breach of Ukraine’s borders and sovereignty.
Reports of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights have repeatedly documented the catastrophic breakdown of the rule of law and ongoing massive human-rights violations in the militant-held areas, including abductions, arbitrary detentions, beatings, torture and summary executions. There are also numerous instances of serious violations of international humanitarian law, to which Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović just referred. The capture and parading of Ukrainian prisoners of war by the militants constitute a possible war crime. The capture of Donetsk airport revealed bodies of executed Ukrainian servicemen with their hands tied behind their backs, as documented in the latest reports.
Attacks against journalists and media outlets continue. At least 60 cases of attacks against the media offices were recorded, and 78 journalists have been held by armed groups since March last year, according to the report. The whereabouts of some remain unknown.
The latest human rights monitoring mission report speaks eloquently of the disturbing human rights situation in occupied Crimea. The Tatar community, those who opposed the sham referendum a year ago, religious communities and minorities are facing threats, harassment, intimidation, abductions and forced disappearances.
Since the annexation by the Russian Federation, the public space in Crimea has been shrinking. The fundamental freedoms of expression and assembly have been severely curtailed. All those holding Ukrainian passports are facing restrictions in exercising their political and civil rights, limited access to social services, tight quotas for residence permits and loss of jobs and homes. Out of 600 schools that offered instruction fully in Ukrainian, not a single one remains. Only 20 schools on the peninsula have separate Ukrainian classes — violating the rights of the Ukrainian community in Crimea.
Religious communities have also been affected. Priests, imams and representatives of other religious communities are being threatened with prosecution, detained and harassed, with their prayer houses and monuments desecrated. People are forced to adopt Russian citizenship or lose their property, rights and income.
Crimean Tatars are in an especially serious condition, as they have no other home but Crimea. Their leaders are evicted from the Mejlis, threatened, prosecuted and deported. Major figures, such as Mustafa Jemilev and Refat Chubarov, have been barred from re-entering Crimea. The Deputy Chairman Ahtem Ciygoz is being detained along with a number of other activists. A number of activists are still missing after being abducted as early as May last year. The son the Crimean Tatar leader Jemilev remains in detention in the Russian Federation under trumped up charges.
Media freedom is under siege in Crimea. The broadcasting of the Ukrainian television channels and Ukrainian Internet have been discontinued. Journalists have been threatened, assaulted and attacked. Investigations have been invoked against the Crimean Tatar newspapers.
In spite of Russia’s allegations to the contrary and in spite of the extremely difficult circumstances, the Ukrainian authorities are continuing the necessary reform processes. We welcome the Ukrainian President’s decree on setting up a constitutional commission, establishing a national council for reform, creating an anti-corruption agency and drafting a national human-rights strategy, which speaks to the Government’s commitment to human rights for all. Those efforts must be wholeheartedly encouraged and supported. The Ukrainian people deserve to have reforms put in place expeditiously and effectively. The Maidan events were not about extremism, as some continue to allege. It was about the passionate desire of the Ukrainian people for reform and for a clear break with a past marked by abuses, corruption, cronyism and graft.
It is also imperative to address the issue of impunity for serious crimes and human-rights violations, including in Crimea and the militant-held areas, which have seen pervasive lawlessness and a total breakdown of accountability. All perpetrators of the most serious crimes, including the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, must be held to account. We call on the Ukrainian authorities to do their utmost in that regard. We also urge Ukraine to complete its accession to the Rome Statute. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that no amnesty should be granted for international crimes, including gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.
My delegation would like to express its appreciation for the engagement in Ukraine of the United Nations and its agencies, and of the OSCE. We look forward to continued reporting, including the spot reports of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, on human rights in Ukraine, including Crimea. The United Nations, the OSCE and their missions should be given full and unhindered access to all areas in Ukraine, including Crimea. The international community, United Nations agencies and humanitarian actors must step up their efforts to help Ukraine cope with the enormous challenges posed by this year-long foreign-sponsored conflict.
The key to the stabilization of the situation in eastern Ukraine lies in the full implementation of the September 2014 Minsk agreements, as reaffirmed on 12 February. The people of Ukraine have heard enough talk from the international community. The time has come to walk the walk. Russia has caused and sponsored this war, and it remains in Russia’s hands to put an end to it by fully and unconditionally abiding by the Minsk agreements, and using its influence on the illegal militants to do the same. Ukraine’s political independence, unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable, and must be respected by all members of the international community without exception.","I to would like to thank Mr. Feltman, Mr. Šimonović and Mr. Ging for their briefings this morning.
Nigeria notes that the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine is holding, although the situation remains tenuous and precarious. The Minsk agreements provide the basis for a long-term resolution of the crisis in Ukraine. They should therefore be respected and not be undermined by acts that run counter to its provisions. The human rights of all peoples must be respected. Humanitarian assistance must reach all those in need without discrimination.
Nigeria urges all sides in Ukraine to refrain from acts that may threaten the ceasefire and erode the gains made in de-escalating the conflict. The ceasefire is a critical confidence-building measure, an important first step towards the implementation of the political, economic and governance aspects of the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements. In our view, the agreements represent a comprehensive framework for a political solution that will hopefully return Ukraine to a state of normalcy and peace and ensure the respect for its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.","Allow me to thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Ivan Šimonović, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights and Mr. John Ging, Director of the Coordination and Response Division of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, for their comprehensive briefings. The crisis in Ukraine has created an extremely difficult humanitarian situation for Ukrainians. Thousands have been forced from their homes and into exile in other areas. Furthermore, more than 1 million people in Ukraine are in dire need of humanitarian assistance. We are therefore compelled to achieve a positive, peaceful settlement that takes into account the interests of all parties puts an end to military actions. Those actions, in addition to other security challenges, continue to hamper the work of humanitarian organizations and stability in Ukraine.
Jordan is increasingly concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Ukraine, including the effects of the random shelling of civilian areas. In the current situation, the first priority must be the protection of civilians, mitigating their suffering through urgent measures to assist displaced persons and Ukrainian refugees and supporting basic services, particularly in the health sector, which has suffered enormously as a result of the crisis in Ukraine.
Furthermore, pressure must be brought to bear on the parties to the conflict, particularly the separatists, to compel them to respect the rules of international humanitarian law and human rights law and to cease all violations thereof. The current divisions among Ukrainians as a result of such violations and breaches may lead to a point of no return in the matter of Ukraine. That serves the interest of no party whatsoever and would have long-term negative effects on security and stability in the region.
Jordan appreciates the limited improvement in the security situation in eastern Ukraine and the ceasefire being respected in some regions. We stress the need for an end to all confrontation in eastern Ukraine. In that regard, we emphasize the need for all parties must uphold their responsibilities under the Minsk agreements and translate those agreements into facts on the ground.
My country underscores the importance of the ongoing meetings under the Normandy format in order to implement the agreements, including a full ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weaponry and the completion of prisoner exchanges, through cooperation with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the working groups to be set up by the Trilateral Contact Group. We consider it necessary to to make additional efforts at this crucial stage aimed at resolving the crisis in Ukraine, especially in the light of the building blocks available to make progress on a political solution.
Jordan supports the efforts of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and other international humanitarian organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross. We call on all parties to lift all obstacles in order to ensure access by those organizations to the areas requiring assistance.
Furthermore, we urge support for the strategic response plan for 2015 set forth by OCHA to ensure humanitarian assistance to the people in need. We stress that such organizations will be unable to carry out their humanitarian work without proper political support from all of the parties to the conflict, in addition to the necessary international financial support for such assistance. We call on the Government of Ukraine to continue implementing the human rights strategy it has developed and to continue drafting the legislation necessary to protect all of its citizens.
In conclusion, Jordan believes that the current positive environment must be used to advantage, following last month’s Minsk meeting. We must ensure the space for a comprehensive political solution in Ukraine that serve to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity and bring together all parts of Ukrainian society.","We thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman for keeping us updated on the political situation in Ukraine. We also thank Mr. John Ging and Mr. Ivan Šimonović for their briefings on the humanitarian situation in the country.
I would like to begin by deploring the death of four demonstrators as the result of a remotely detonated device, on 22 February in Kharkiv. We hope that terrorism will not spread. Ukraine is a country that has already suffered greatly; it needs to rebuild a peaceful society in which its citizens will not have to fear for their lives or well-being. In that connection, we were pleased to hear that, since the signing of the Minsk agreements, there has been a decrease in tensions in Ukraine and progress has been achieved — for example, on prisoner exchanges between the parties.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to begin to speak of a political solution when we know that, since the ceasefire entered into force on 15 February, 60 Ukrainian soldiers and an unknown number of separatists and civilians have died. Indeed, confrontations persist in some regions of the country. We once again urge the parties to fully implement the ceasefire.
According to the package of measures adopted on 12 February, the deadline for the withdrawal of heavy weaponry will expire tomorrow, 7 March. That process was developed with limited access by the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Chile believes that the process must be transparent and that the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine must be given an inventory of the weapons in the country and full access to information on the withdrawal so that it can play its full role in monitoring the ceasefire and the arms stockpiles.
Despite those difficulties, it will be able to manage this phase without major setbacks, in accordance with the programme established in the package of measures, which should not interfere with the establishment of working groups and the finding of a political solution to the conflict. We are also concerned that access was not given to a United Nations rescue team following a methane explosion in a Donetsk mine. We stress the fact that access to humanitarian and emergency support must be unrestricted throughout the territory of Ukraine, and the authorities must ensure the protection of the entire Ukrainian population.
It is necessary to put a clear end to the confrontation so that the international community and the Government of Ukraine can concentrate their efforts and resources on dealing with the humanitarian and economic crisis. Ukraine will need all the help it can get in addressing the humanitarian crisis, which has left more than 1 million people displaced. The Government must find lasting solutions for the provision of housing, employment and social services and the integration of those people who, because of the conflict, will not be able to return to their places of origin. In that vein, we are pleased that the international community is supporting the Government’s reform programme, and we hope that it will continue to support the implementation of the necessary changes.","I thank Lithuania for taking the initiative to hold this debate on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. I would also like to thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs; Mr. John Ging, Director of the Coordination and Response Division of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs; and Mr. Ivan Šimonović, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, for their briefings.
Chad is very concerned about the grave security and humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine, despite the recent calm that has prevailed following the signing of the 12 February agreements.
The fighting and blind bombings between the Government and the separatist groups have primarily affected the civilian population. The report on human rights in Ukraine covering the period from 1 December 2013 to 15 February 2014 states that 1,012 people were killed and 3,793 injured in the fighting in eastern Ukraine. In total, from April 2014 to February 2015, the conflict has caused 6,000 deaths, including 375 women and 63 children, and over 14,000 injured, including 650 women and 150 children. The conflict has also resulted in over a million internally displaced persons and refugees, including thousands of vulnerable people, in particular elderly and handicapped persons found in the combat zones without access to humanitarian aid. In addition, there has been a massive destruction of public and private infrastructure, including schools, health centres and homes.
It is a heavy toll, and the humanitarian situation highlights the responsibility of political actors and leaders to find lasting solutions for the affected populations. Such solutions must include the implementation of the Minsk agreements, including the ceasefire, the prohibition on the use of heavy weaponry and other relevant provisions of the agreements. Priority should be given to free and unhindered access to conflict areas in order to allow for the quick and non-discriminatory delivery of necessary humanitarian aid to internally displaced persons; the strengthening of evacuation measures; lasting solutions to the issues of shelter, jobs and integration for refugees; and the release of all persons detained illegally or arbitrarily; and the identification of effective measures to counter violence against women, guarantee the freedom and security of the media and put in place educational measures to allow students to pursue their studies.
Finally, the implementation of such measures must be carried out with respect for international norms and the recommendations contained in the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and in line with General Assembly resolution 68/262 on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.",,,,,,,,
S/PV.7395,27/02/2015,Briefings on the sscalation of the conflict in Donbas and follow-ups on the Minsk agreement,"In accordance with rule 39 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite Ambassador Heidi Tagliavini, Special Representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Chairperson-in- Office in Ukraine, and Ambassador Ertuğrul Apakan, Head of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, to participate in this meeting. On behalf of the Council, I welcome Ambassadors Tagliavini and Apakan, who are joining today’s meeting via video-teleconference from Kyiv. The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. I now give the floor to Ambassador Tagliavini. I thank Ambassador Apakan for his briefing. The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda. Before adjourning the meeting, I would like to express the Chinese delegation’s sincere appreciation to the members of the Council, especially my colleagues the Permanent Representatives, their staffs and the Secretariat of the Council, for all the support they have given us. It has indeed been a busy month, and one in which we rallied to arrive at a consensus on several important issues within our purview. We could not have done it alone or without the hard work, support and positive contributions of every delegation and the representatives of the Secretariat, as well as all the relevant conference service officers. As we end our presidency, I know I speak for the whole Council in wishing the delegation of France good luck in the month of March. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S/PV.7384,17/02/2015,Introduction of the measures necesssary for the implementation of the Minsk agreements through a resolution tabled by the Russian Federation and discussion thereof,"In accordance with rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite the representatives of Germany and Ukraine to participate in this meeting. The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. Members of the Council have before them document S/2015/117, which contains the text of a draft resolution submitted by the Russian Federation. It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now. There were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as resolution 2202 (2015). I shall now give the floor to those members of the Council who wish to make statements following the adoption of the resolution. ","The urgency of the situation in Ukraine calls for action. The conflict has resulted in more than 5,000 deaths in 10 months, including the victims of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, for which those responsible must answer for their acts, as called for in resolution 2166 (2014). Given a security and humanitarian situation that remains of great concern, our collective responsibility as members of the Security Council is to do everything possible to silence the guns and arrive at an agreement. That is the aim of the courageous and determined approach that the President of France and the German Chancellor have taken in the past two weeks. We have always believed that the path to peace includes diplomacy. We have always said that the solution to the Ukrainian conflict can only be a political one. With today’s resolution 2202 (2015), the Council is putting all its weight and all its authority to silence the guns and chart a course towards peace. As its title indicates, the text concluded in Minsk on 12 February consists of a set of sequential steps intended to implement the Minsk protocol and memorandum, which were agreed, respectively, on 5 and 19 September 2014. They provide in particular for what was and continues to be the absolute priority: the establishment of a ceasefire — which entered into force at midnight on Saturday-Sunday. Full and sustained respect for the ceasefire is the cornerstone for an exit from the crisis. The speech made by President Poroshenko on Saturday night, in which he gave orders to the whole of the Ukrainian forces to cease fire, confirms Ukraine’s commitment to seeking peace. While the ceasefire is universally respected, fighting unfortunately continues, especially in Debaltseve. The fighting must stop immediately, as the Council just demanded in its statement to the press adopted an hour ago (SC/11784). The Minsk package also calls for the retreat of the warring parties and of heavy weapons, which will make it possible to establish an expanded buffer zone — from 50 to 70 kilometres, in fact larger than the area called for by the Minsk agreements of September 2014. All heavy weapons must be withdrawn within two weeks. This element is an important step towards peace, and it must take concrete form in reality. It is up to the signatory parties to the agreements, including Russia, to give substance to the commitments they have undertaken by their actions. I repeat it here on behalf of France: only actions will count. By the resolution we have adopted today, the Security Council has endorsed its commitments as did the Heads of State under the Normandy format. Those commitments have thus become obligations undertaken by the signatories to the Minsk agreements before the international community. These are commitments whose scrupulous observance the Council will follow with the utmost diligence. Along with its Council partners, therefore, France calls upon all the parties to lastingly and fully assume their responsibilities to move forward along this demanding path towards peace. ","We are grateful to the members of the Council for the unanimous adoption of the Russian Federation’s draft resolution in support of the arrangements to settle the Ukrainian crisis reached in Minsk on 12 February. The events that have taken place during the yearlong conflict in the territory of that country have been truly tragic. Thousands of people have died and many towns and villages in eastern Ukraine have been nearly destroyed. More than a million civilians have Ukraine 17/02/2015 left the conflict zone, the vast majority of whom have sought shelter on Russian territory. We believe that now, following the unprecedented diplomatic efforts undertaken in Minsk on 12 February by the highest authorities of Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine, there is a genuine opportunity for Ukraine to turn this tragic page in its history. We support the high assessment of the adoption on 12 February of the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and the declaration of the four leaders. We are fully prepared to facilitate the implementation of those agreements. All sides must fully comply with the Minsk agreements. We must avoid the adoption of unilateral measures that would clearly contravene the letter and the spirit of the documents adopted in Minsk on 12 February. Since the very start of the crisis, Russia has actively called for its peaceful settlement through inclusive and transparent dialogue between the sides in the internal Ukrainian conflict and has done its utmost to ensure that an open dialogue is established on fundamental political and constitutional issues. We will adhere to this principled approach in future also. We had hoped that the unanimous adoption of resolution 2202 (2015) and today’s discussion in the Security Council, the first since reaching the Minsk agreements of 12 February, would send a unifying signal and pave the way for greater harmony in the Council’s work than before on the issue of the Ukraine crisis. Our hopes were partly realized. We continue to hope that this clear, concise resolution will guide the parties towards implementing the decisions adopted in Minsk. However, we were disappointed by the discussion, because some colleagues decided to begin with their usual rhetoric, which was often offensive. Particularly offensive were the attempts to rewrite the Minsk agreements in these conditions. Some delegations picked out certain parts of the agreement to interpret the Minsk agreements. The situation now is very simple: we need to look at the provisions of the resolution and implement the document as it was adopted, as is the usual fashion. I should also mention the expression used by Ms. Power in referring to an “upside-down world”. She accused Russia of starting the crisis, but did we topple the legally elected President? Throughout all of the events that took place in Ukraine a year ago, Russia continually called for a bloodless political solution. We supported the 21 February agreement. We then insisted on its implementation, even after the lawfully elected President had been toppled. We supported the 17 April communiqué that called for constitutional dialogue. We supported the initiative by the Chair of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). What was the impetus for the armed conflict that we are seeing? The impetus was the support by certain Western countries of the decision of the Kyiv leadership to militarily suppress the dissatisfaction of the people in the east. They set fire to them in Odesa and burned them alive in Mariupol. They launched a military operation in Donbas and started to send in heavy guns. What is war? War is when there is an attack and there is a defence. That is what we have been seeing in recent times. That is what happened in Debaltseve. Kyiv could have acted nobly after reaching the 12 February agreement. They could have allowed their soldiers surrounded in Debaltseve to save their lives. Instead, they first denied that they were surrounded, and then they began issuing orders not to lay down weapons. There are certain rules to the game; you cannot let heavy equipment out of a surrounded area because that would simply qualify as regrouping. What we are seeing is a regrouping of Ukrainian armed forces after the September agreements in Minsk. Such a courageous decision by the Ukrainian authorities could have saved the lives of civilians. Instead, Kyiv preferred to get carried away by patriotic rhetoric and called for actions that have led to the most tragic consequences. Ms. Power spoke of the difficult situation for civilians in Debaltseve. What about the citizens in Debaltseve who could not leave the city? One’s heart bleeds for them. And are the people in Donetsk any better off? Why did she say nothing about them? Ukrainian security forces have been shelling Donetsk for months, but no one seems to be bothered about that. Many other villages and towns have been razed to the ground as a result of the actions of Ukrainian security forces. Why did no one in the West say anything about those situations? We have been flagging those situations all along. For some reason, however, there has been no reaction from our Western colleagues. The September Minsk agreements have not been upheld as we initially hoped because the shelling of towns has continued. The OSCE monitors therefore need to do their work, including in and around Debaltseve. For that to happen, however, safe conditions must be established. We all must recall that these are unarmed people. Yes, they are in armoured cars, but without certain minimum security conditions they cannot effectively control or monitor anything. To be honest, I am surprised that our Ukrainian colleague today returned to the issue of the 14 humanitarian convoys. Convoys have saved hundreds of civilian lives in Donbas and Luhansk under shelling, while being surrounded and subject to the active blockade established by the Ukrainian authorities against the people of those cities. We have always Kyiv to cooperate with us in organizing the convoys. Each and every time they have refused to cooperate; I believe that the Ukrainian customs officers inspected the convoys only once. We will not allow anyone to play games with these issues. Kyiv needs to help us save people’s lives. People need to get through the winter. Russia has been providing aid, and we are very satisfied and pleased with the assistance we have been able to offer. Two colleagues mentioned Crimea. I have just one word to those statements: 93. Recently, a German public opinion group conducted a poll among Crimean residents and came to the conclusion that 93 per cent of the people in Crimea supported unification with Russia. In addition, 82 per cent said that outright; 11 per cent said they would prefer it; 4 per cent were against it. That is even slightly more than the percentage in favour in the referendum on Crimea’s unification with Russia. With regard to territorial integrity, resolution 2202 (2015) confirms the territorial integrity of Ukraine — and this in February 2015. I am glad to hear that the United States is not going to prevent the implementation of the Minsk agreements. With regard to the implementation of the Minsk agreements and the statement about Russia repeating certain previous arguments, we are not pretending anything. We proposed a certain course of action. No one listened to us. We warned about the consequences. Sadly, those consequences are what they have been. This has all been happening on our borders. We made our choice, as set out in the Minsk agreements. I hope that those agreements will be duly delivered on. I hope that peace can be restored in Ukraine and that there can be social consensus in the country — which has not existed for a very long time now, not even before the past year when the President was toppled. That is what we need to work on, which Kyiv, for some reason, has not wanted to do. For instance, one can see the disgust over the new national holiday, which was declared on the same date that they established collaboration with the pro-Nazi army. They have said nothing about setting up a new Constitution — a genuine pity. That is what Russia had already warned about. Let us look at the situation clearly and objectively. If Ukraine needs to find a way for dialogue it should do so at last. But they are unable to do so. That is why we keep saying, let us establish dialogue with the people in the east. But Ukraine says that we are interfering. They are asking us: What do the people in the east want? We say that the people in the east want federalization. They should therefore go and find that dialogue. I would very much like to have left the last word to my Lithuanian colleague; I would have loved to, if I could. I am probably abusing my speaking time, but after what she said I cannot help but respond with a couple of words. “Capitulate one’s territory.” Has the full meaning of the Minsk agreements been understood? Everything that we are talking about concerns the reintegration of Ukraine. How significant is it where the line is drawn in such conditions? In recent months, the problem has been that the Ukrainian security forces have been shelling towns. They had to be pushed back from Donetsk so that they could not shell the cities. But with all that bloodshed, if Ukraine is to be reintegrated, is there a desire to draw a new State borderline? In that case, let us draw a new State borderline and then we can address that issue. Now, as to the issue of weapons, Lithuania is, I believe, the only State that has sincerely and officially stated that it is supplying weapons to Kyiv. Perhaps the militia could also be provided with some of those Lithuanian weapons? The members of the Council have continued to provoke me. We are not interpreting anything. We are taking the Minsk agreements and interpreting them word by word, and we think that everyone should read the document word by word and implement it. ","The United Kingdom voted in favour of resolution 2202 (2015) because of the importance of providing full Security Council backing for the agreements reached in Minsk on 5 and 19 September 2014 and of 12 February this year. These agreements must now be implemented comprehensively and according to the agreed timelines in order to secure a sustainable and peaceful resolution of the crisis in eastern Ukraine. Over 5,400 people have lost their lives in this conflict and over 1.5 million have been displaced. The parties must commit to and invest in this opportunity for peace. We welcome the intensive diplomatic efforts that have brought us to this point, but agreements have been reached before. This time, we must see commitments translated into action and full delivery of the obligations that have been undertaken. The ceasefire has now been in place for two and a half days. Reporting from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) suggests that it has been respected in the majority of the Donbas. However, intense fighting continues around Debaltseve, where heavy shelling and street-by-street fighting have resulted in scores of casualties. This flagrant disregard of the ceasefire is deeply concerning and risks undermining the Minsk package in its entirety. The fighting for Debaltseve must stop, and any detained soldier must be treated humanely. It is totally unacceptable that separatist leaders have made statements claiming that the ceasefire did not apply to Debaltseve, where they were clearly intent on making further territorial gains, and it is deeply concerning that the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission has not been given access to the town. The press statement that the Council has just agreed (SC/11784) makes clear our collective, grave concern over Debaltseve and our unified call for OSCE access. The actions in and around Debaltseve are not the actions of a party interested in peace. We recall how a Russian-backed separatist offensive brought to an end the ceasefire agreed in September — a cynical effort to undermine the September Minsk agreements and create new realities on the ground. We therefore call on Russia to use its influence on the separatists to cease their onslaught against that town and abide by their commitments. It is vital that the ceasefire be respected in full and upheld across all of eastern Ukraine. But the ceasefire is only the first step in a series of obligations set out in the Minsk package. We also expect to see the withdrawal of heavy weapons by both sides over the next two weeks in order to create an effective security zone. As the Minsk package makes clear, this process should be facilitated, monitored and verified by the OSCE. It is welcome that the Ukrainian armed forces have already set out their withdrawal plan to the Monitoring Mission. We call on the separatists to show the same commitment to that crucial element of the Minsk package. In parallel, we look forward to progress being made towards local elections, special status legislation, the release of all hostages, and the urgent distribution of humanitarian assistance on the basis of an international mechanism. The resolution we have adopted today reaffirms resolution 2166 (2014) on the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, in which the Council demanded that those responsible be held to account and that all States cooperate with the efforts to establish accountability. Let me be clear that the amnesty provided for in the Minsk package does not apply to those who may be found responsible for that dreadful crime. The Council must scrutinize closely the implementation of the Minsk package and use its influence to prevent any repetition of what we saw last autumn. We call on Russia to deliver on the promises it has made. Russia has committed to the implementation of the Minsk agreements at the highest level. That commitment needs to be reflected in actions on the ground. We also call on Russia to use its undoubted influence over the separatists to ensure that they meet their commitments in full. Until we see such actions, international pressure must remain on Russia and its separatist proxies. The Council must play its full role in ensuring that there is complete compliance so that stability can be restored and to guarantee the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine. That must include regular and close monitoring of the ceasefire and a willingness to take further steps in the event that it is not implemented. Finally, it will be recalled that this crisis began with Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea. As we approach thefirst anniversary, we must not let events in eastern Ukraine distract us from Russia’s blatant disregard for the Charter of the United Nations through its illegal annexation of Crimea. ","We have gotten used to living in an upside-down world with respect to Ukraine. Russia speaks of peace and then fuels conflict. Russia signs agreements and then does everything within its power to undermine them. Russia champions the sovereignty of nations and then acts as if its neighbours’ borders do not exist. Yet even for those of us growing accustomed to living in an upside-down world, the idea that Russia — which manufactured and continues to escalate the violence in Ukraine — has submitted a resolution today calling for the conflict’s peaceful solution is ironic, to say the least. It is bitterly ironic, given that the Council has dedicated some 30 meetings to calling on Russia to stop escalating the very same conflict, and given the human consequences that are growing daily. Even as Russia put forward resolution 2202 (2015), separatists that Russia has trained and armed and whom it fights alongside are laying ruthless and deadly siege to the Ukrainian-held city of Debaltseve, approximately 30 to 40 kilometres beyond lines established by the September Minsk agreements. Throughout the day, we have heard conflicting reports as to whether Debaltseve has fallen. According to press reports, the so- road of life leading out of Debaltseve has become a road of death, littered with the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers. At the same time that the Council is calling for the ceasefire that was supposed to take effect at midnight on Saturday, Russia is backing an all-out assault. We do not know how many civilians are left in Debaltseve because Russia and the separatists it supports have refused to guarantee the safety of impartial monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, who have been trying for days to enter the area — a commitment that, in this upside-down world, Russia and the separatists made on 12 February at Minsk. But we know from credible press reports that thousands of civilians in Debaltseve and neighbouring villages have been sheltering from heavy shelling in dank basements, often without running water, food, electricity or basic medical supplies. We know that many of the civilians left, who are enduring the terror of this relentless assault, are the elderly and small children — people who could not evacuate on their own. Even with such limited information, we know with certainty that at the same time that Russia signs on to yet another agreement committing itself to de-escalation and peace, forces that Russia trains, equips and joins on the battlefield have only escalated this fighting, grabbing more territory and killing the Ukrainian soldiers who stand in their way. We are caught in a deadly feedback loop. International leaders engage in rigorous, exhaustive negotiations to get Russia to commit to peace — in Geneva, in Normandy, in Minsk in September, in Berlin in February, again in Minsk on 12 February when the implementations were signed, and now in New York — yet Russia’s commitments have no bearing on the actions of its soldiers and the separatists they back on the ground. The United States has maintained the same position across 30 meetings of the Security Council with respect to Ukraine. Let me reiterate that position. We are for peace in Ukraine. We are for Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity. We are for ending the violence in eastern Ukraine that has taken more than 5,600 lives since last April and already displaced approximately 1 million people. We are for all of the signatories to the agreements signed in Minsk in September 2014, particularly Russia and the separatists they back, fulfilling the commitments that they have made, and we are for the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements of 5 and 19 September, and the package of measures endorsed last week by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France. To be clear, the 12 February implementation package is a road map to fulfilling the commitments made by the same signatories in the September Minsk agreements. President Hollande, President Poroshenko, Chancellor Merkel and President Putin each made that clear when they endorsed the implementation package on 12 February and issued their joint declaration, in which they “remained committed to the implementation of the Minsk agreements”. The Minsk agreements in the title — plural — refer to those signed on 5 and 19 September by the same signatories, while the measures for implementation in the title made clear that the 12 February package was designed to begin carrying out the September agreements and not to supplant them, as Russia has now begun to argue. The United States rejects any interpretation of resolution 2202 (2015) that would abrogate the parties’ earlier commitments. All parties must implement all of the commitments made in the September Minsk agreements. The implementation steps agreed upon in the 12 February package include a comprehensive ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the September line of contact, the release of all hostages and the eventual restoration of Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and control of its international border. Too often debates in the Council occur in a vacuum, removed from the real world. In the real world a man named Aleksey Kravchenko, a 73-year-old in the Ukrainian-held town of Svitlodarsk, near Debaltseve, recently told a reporter that he had spent nights huddled together with his grandchildren in a bomb shelter on his property as shelling continued throughout the night. Aleksey told the reporter that his grandchildren said to him in the shelter “Grandpa, I don’t want to die young.” He said, “I held my grandchildren and they were shaking, and I looked in their eyes and they were afraid”. “With the 12 February agreement, now we are hoping”, he also said. The fighting, unfortunately, has in fact increased dramatically near Aleksey’s home. But we call on Russia to translate hope into real action, to translate hope into real results — and to do so urgently. Today’s Council meeting is an effort to throw the Council’s weight behind an agreement already jeopardized by statements by the separatists dismissing the full ceasefire, by their continued attacks on Debaltseve and by their refusal, together with Russia’s, to allow access to the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. We look to Russia, which manufactured and fuelled this conflict, to leave the upside-down world it has created and to honour the resolution it introduced today in support of efforts to end it. I just want to be clear in response to my Russian colleague that the United States wholeheartedly welcomes the agreement. We will do all we can to support it. But if Russia is committed to peace, it does not need a Security Council resolution to prove it. There are actually easier ways to prove it. Russia could stop arming the separatists; stop sending hundreds of heavy weapons across the border, in addition to Russian troops; stop pretending that it is not doing what it is doing; and start calling on and insisting that the separatists observe the ceasefire around Debaltseve. Resolution or no resolution, what matters is fulfilling the commitments that have been made now multiple times. I assure him that we will be the first to take notice, and it will actually be very easy to see whether or not the commitments are being met. ",,,,,,,,,,,"Let me start with our thanks to you personally, Mr. President, and to the members of the Security Council for today’s strong statement on the situation in Debaltseve. I will speak on that issue later.
We are grateful to the members of the Security Council for their continued support of the Minsk process since the first agreements on a peaceful settlement were adopted, on 5 and 19 September. Ukraine welcomes the Council’s support for the recent 12 February agreements, which do not substitute for but, rather, reinforce those adopted last Semptember.
The Russian side quite obviously positions itself as a devoted proponent of the peace process and a guarantor of the effective implementation of the Minsk agreements. It even proposed resolution 2203 (2015), which has just been adopted. Yet that is all on paper; what happens in reality is quite the opposite.
Ukraine has demonstrated a responsible attitude to fulfilling the international obligations it has undertaken. The arrangement on ensuring the ceasefire regime starting 15 February has been fulfilled as stipulated in the documents adopted in Minsk and in the Normandy format with the participation of the Presidents of Ukraine, France and Russia and the Chancellor of Germany. Withdrawing heavy weaponry after ensuring an unconditional, comprehensive and sustainable ceasefire — with the assistance and monitoring of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the support of the trilateral contact group — was to be the next step.
Unfortunately, despite hopes for a responsible position on the part of all the parties that adopted the 12 February declaration in support of the package of measures on the fulfilment of the Minsk agreements and the signatories to that set of measures — including the Russian Federation and the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic — there has been a failure to comply with the agreements, and the hope for peace has virtually been ruined. Instead, at the moment there are attempts to return everyone to war and an escalation of the situation.
Yesterday, after telephone negotiations with the President of Russia, the Chancellor of Germany and the President of France, there was an agreement to hold negotiations at the level of the representatives of the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine, the general staff of the armed forces of the Russian Federation and representatives of Luhansk and Donetsk. Negotiations were held this morning via video teleconference. While restoring the access of the OSCE mission to Debaltseve was to be the outcome of the negotiations, the Russian party blocked the opportunity. Militants in control of Debaltseve have declared the continuation of offensive operations, thereby flagrantly violating all of the previous arrangements and the entire package of the Minsk agreements.
From midnight on 15 February until this morning, Ukrainian positions were shelled more than 160 times — not with small arms, but with mortars, artillery systems, rocket systems and tanks. Eleven servicemen were killed and 36 wounded as a result of those attacks by the terrorists. Yet the Ukrainian military has kept its weapons silent, unless it was under direct attack.
On the very first day of the ceasefire, the Russian side illegally brought the fourteenth so-called humanitarian convoy into the east of Ukraine. As before, that was done without the consent of the Ukrainian side and without activating the international mechanism that the 12 February arrangements clearly envisaged.
I have not mentioned that the number of trucks, as well as their contents, does not match what was declared in the documents. I think it will not be a surprise to any member of the Council to hear that heavy weapons and equipment continue to be shipped to the east of Ukraine. Today at least 12 armoured vehicles and 54 trucks with ammunition broke into Ukraine through the Izvaryne border checkpoint, which the Ukrainian Government currently does not control.
The situation in Debaltseve is incredibly tense. Again with the support of Russian forces and heavy weapons, the militants are incessantly and violently attacking Ukrainian positions in and around the town. Taking advantage of the situation of the Ukrainian military refraining from taking action, in line with the ceasefire, the militants and Russian forces have done their best to surround the town. The militants’ ringleader blatantly threatened to kill every defender of Debaltseve unless they laid down their weapons. He also threatened to move westward and seize the city of Kharkiv. Civilians are also falling victim to the indiscriminate shelling of the town by the terrorists.
The cruel assaults on Debaltseve and many other locations essentially make a mockery of the ceasefire concept and undermine the very essence of the peace process. Against that backdrop, we call on the countries participating in the Minsk negotiations — Germany, France and Russia — to make every possible effort to ensure the fulfilment of the Minsk plan based on the 5 September Minsk protocol, the Minsk memorandum of 19 September and the documents adopted on 12 February in Minsk.
We call on the countries Members of the United Nations to express a decisive protest against the blocking of the work of the OSCE special monitoring mission. We also call on the permanent members of the Security Council to prevent further violation of the fundamental principles and rules of the United Nations and avert the unleashing of full-scale warfare in the very centre of Europe.
To become a real contributor to a peaceful settlement of the conflict, the Russian Federation needs to withdraw all of its armed forces from the territory of Ukraine and to secure the Russian-Ukrainian border, as well as to force Russian-backed separatists to fulfil the provisions of the Minsk agreements.
The chance for peace must be used. The unity of the entire civilized world in solidarity with Ukraine gives hope for the restoration of peace. What has been called the unification of Crimea should really be called occupation and annexation following an aggressive attack. We shall discuss that further.
What was said about humanitarian convoys is a challenge to international law, which defines arrangements for supplies of humanitarian assistance to a second country. In today’s statement by the representative of Russia, international law was once again trampled all over. They have their law and they know how to use it.
As to a constitution, we reject anything that smacks of Russian interference. Russia has been trying to tell us how we should develop and what our constitutional order should be — what the next Constitution should look like. Everything was clearly stated to our people.
With regard to the eastern regions, as well as elsewhere, work is under way on decentralization and expanding the powers of local authorities.
Therefore, once again, I ask that Russia not interfere in our affairs. We will decide for ourselves how to live, what to build and how to establish dialogue with our own people. I am sorry, Mr. President, but what we have heard from our colleague is unacceptable. Our leaders met in Minsk and they made very clear statements. They supported very clear provisions, and we cannot agree with the interpretation of the Minsk agreements that has been heard from the Russian side. I am so sorry, but we are not here to launch a third round of Minsk negotiations and reinterpret what our leaders agreed upon.","Germany welcomes resolution 2202 (2015), just adopted by the Security Council, which endorses the 12 February package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements of September 2014. The Security Council has thus sent a clear signal that it is ready to assume its responsibility at this crucial juncture in the conflict in and around Ukraine to ensure the comprehensive implementation of the package of measures for implementation of the Minsk protocol of 5 September and the Minsk memorandum of 19 September 2014, which remain, in their entirety, the unalterable legal and political basis for the conflict settlement process. We hope that the endorsement of the Minsk agreements by the Council will have a strong stabilizing effect on the situation on the ground and contribute to the strict and full implementation of the ceasefire and to the follow-on political process.
According to current reporting by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, thus far the ceasefire has been largely holding, with the most deplorable exception of Debaltseve, as outlined in the Council’s press statement (SC/11784). The continuing attacks threaten not only the ceasefire, they also undermine the political settlement process as agreed upon in the framework of the trilateral contact group and as endorsed by the Normandy format Heads of State and Government in Minsk.
Against that background, today’s resolution is of the utmost importance. The resolution conveys a stern message to those who violate the ceasefire. The ceasefire spoilers must know that they are opposing the resolve of the international community.
Germany reiterates its commitment to the sovereignty, political independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 68/262, on the situation in Ukraine. I would also like to reiterate our condemnation of the illegal annexation of Crimea, which we will not recognize. It is our clear understanding, in the context of this resolution, that the territorial integrity of Ukraine means territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We find ourselves at a crucial moment in the evolution of the conflict in Ukraine. Spain voted in favour of resolution 2202 (2015) not just because we fully agree with its contents, but because we believe that the Security Council, which has very closely followed the conflict, could not remain on the sidelines, especially now.
Since the Minsk protocol of 5 September, there have been thousands of victims — 5,000, in fact, many of them innocent civilians — owing to breakdowns in the ceasefire. The human tragedy in Ukraine is unsustainable, and it is essential to put an end to it. Spain therefore appreciates and welcomes the step taken by France and Germany, an initiative we firmly support.
Last Thursday in Minsk, all the parties agreed to give dialogue a new chance, aware of the fact that the military option was not a solution to the crisis in Ukraine. They therefore committed themselves in this new agreement to put in place a ceasefire, along with the other aspects of the peace process agreed in Minsk last September — which have gone systematically unfulfilled and violated.
As set out in the press statement made public a few minutes ago (SC/11784), we also note with concern that, having entered into force on 15 February, as agreed in Minsk, the ceasefire is not being respected overall. We are concerned in particular about the ongoing fighting in Debaltseve. The parties must fully implement the agreement reached last week, beginning with an immediate ceasefire in line with the terms agreed. Of course, the success of this new agreement will continue in large measure to depend upon the willingness of the parties. If we want peace, it must be implemented in good faith and completely.
There is no need to recall the gravity of the conflict to peace and stability in Europe. In that regard, I would like to conclude by reiterating that the host of measures agreed in Minsk on 12 February give a very important role both to the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. As a member of both organizations, Spain agrees that both bodies have much to contribute to this process. Of course, we will work responsibly and with determination to ensure that happens.","New Zealand associates itself with the statement just made by the representative of Malaysia, and we compliment his country on that particular initiative.
It is no secret that over the past four days the Security Council has struggled to negotiate a mutually acceptable text for resolution 2202 (2015). Given the history of the matter, given the bitterness of the conflict and given the active support of troops and materiel that continues to be provided to the separatists, that struggle was hardly surprising. However, those problems should not obscure the very simple truth: that above all our combined objective must be to see an end to the fighting in eastern Ukraine and a genuine and holding ceasefire with lives saved as a result, to see respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and to see an end to external support for the separatists. That is the standard by which we have judged this resolution and voted accordingly.
New Zealand really does appreciate the fact that Europeans have at last been able to come together and act together to address this crisis, and, as a result of this resolution, can now be seen to do so with the unequivocal support of the Council. That is what we understand in what negotiating parties sought to achieve in Minsk last week, and indeed in that same city in September 2014. We have therefore supported the outcome they agreed.
We might not like the compromises. We might identify shortcomings. We know that ceasefires do not always hold and, certainly, as events right now in Debaltseve clearly demonstrate, they do not always hold with consistency at all times and in all places. But it has been agreed by those most directly affected. We have now sent a signal of the Council’s support for a ceasefire, which is another step towards the long-needed political settlement. We have done so unanimously as the Security Council.
Along with fellow Council member Malaysia, New Zealand has a direct interest in respect of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 — a victim of the Ukrainian conflict — an interest we share with non-Council members Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, the Netherlands and the Philippines, with whom both countries have actively consulted over the past few days. The Council’s previous decisions on Flight MH-17 are absolutely clear, so we welcome the reaffirmation of resolution 2166 (2014), which is the primary statement of the Council regarding the accountability of those who illegally launched a surface-to-air missile at a civilian passenger aircraft, murdering 298 people on board.
We thank the primary sponsors of the resolution for taking up and incorporating the language proposed by Malaysia and New Zealand during the negotiations, thus ensuring that the victims are not forgotten and that those responsible may be ultimately held to account. New Zealand agrees with the United Kingdom that the amnesty agreed in Minsk does not and cannot apply to those responsible for that crime.
The adoption of resolution 2202 (2015) does not take place in a vacuum, which is a point that is implicit in the press statement issued by the Council only an hour or so ago (SC/11784). The Council is keenly aware of the fragility of the present ceasefire, of instances where it is only partly observed and of places like Debaltseve where right now it is being outright ignored so that one side can secure a territorial advantage on the ground, after which they might presumably then make as though they are observing what has previously been agreed. That can only be deplored, but it does not alter the fact that the parties have solemnly agreed and committed to a ceasefire and that it is holding in most places, and that is saving lives.
All of us must therefore continue to urge compliance with the agreement and with resolution 2202 (2015), particularly Russia, as a party to the Minsk agreements, which agreed the ceasefire. It is in that capacity that we call upon Russia to use its undoubted and considerable influence on the separatists to require them to honour that which has been agreed. If that happens, more lives will be saved as a result.","I have the honour to make this statement on behalf of the delegations of Australia, Belgium, Canada, Indonesia, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the Philippines, as well as on behalf of my own delegation, Malaysia.
We join other Security Council members in welcoming the adoption of resolution 2202 (2015), on the situation in Ukraine. We believe that the adoption of the resolution will convey the Council’s — and by extension the international community’s — strong support for the steps taken by the parties concerned to implement the ceasefire arrangements agreed on 12 February. We reiterate our full support for all peaceful efforts aimed at resolving the conflict in Ukraine.
The recent developments in eastern Ukraine prove that a diplomatic and political solution is more urgent than ever. In that regard, we particularly commend the diplomatic initiatives that yielded the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements last week.
The conflict in eastern Ukraine has gone on for far too long and has claimed the lives of far too many innocent civilians, including the 298 souls aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, which was tragically shot down over the conflict area on 17 July 2014. In the aftermath of the tragedy, the Council responded by adopting resolution 2166 (2014), which, inter alia, emphasizes the need for a full, thorough and independent international investigation into the incident and demands that those responsible for the incident be held to account and that all States cooperate fully with efforts to establish accountability. It also clearly outlines the obligations incumbent upon all States Members of the United Nations to cooperate in that regard to bring those responsible to justice.
The resolution adopted today is unambiguous in reaffirming the Council’s demand in resolution 2166 (2014) for accountability for those responsible for the downing of Flight MH-17. We reiterate that this demand remains the international standard with respect to accountability and applies to all States Members of the United Nations, particularly set against the Minsk agreements and the package of measures. In that regard, our delegations welcome the reaffirmation of resolution 2166 (2014) in the present resolution.
In conclusion, we call upon the conflicting parties to fully adhere to and implement the Minsk agreements in line with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations as well as the sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence and unity of Ukraine. We wish to see an immediate and full implementation of the ceasefire agreement, which could ultimately pave the way for a sustained political solution and restore peace and stability to the affected areas.","The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela fully supports today’s resolution 2022 (2015) because we consider it a very important and fundamental contribution to an agreement on a political and peaceful solution to this conflict. My country supports a peaceful resolution to conflicts in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Venezuela emphasize’s that the mediation of the countries in the region and active diplomacy are the path to a negotiated resolution of the conflict. In that connection, we support the fact that the Security Council endorses through this resolution the statement adopted at Minsk on 12 February by the Presidents of the Russian Federation, Ukraine and France and the Chancellor of Germany in support of the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements. Those agreements should have all the necessary political support for their implementation. We trust in the political will of the Heads of State that made that possible.
Moreover, Venezuela welcomes the fact that this resolution reaffirms resolution 2166 (2014) with respect to carrying out a transparent, full, exhaustive and independent international investigation, in conformity with international civil aviation guidelines, that makes it possible to determine responsibility for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 so as to bring to justice those responsible for that heinous act. We call on the parties to adhere strictly to the obligations pertaining to the protection of civilians, including the need to guarantee humanitarian access to provide assistance to internally displaced persons, refugees and other persons residing in the areas affected by the conflict, in accordance with the package of measures for the implementation of the 12 February Minsk agreements.
In conclusion, we do not believe that this is a time for hate, fear or war propaganda. This is a time for peace, political dialogue and diplomacy.",,"It is with a heavy heart that we voted for today’s resolution 2202 (2015), and with a clear understanding of the terrible toll that this uninvited war has imposed on Ukraine. More than 20,000 people have been internally displaced owing to the illegal annexation of Crimea; at least 5,665 people have been killed, some 2,000 of them since the announcement of the ceasefire in September; nearly 14,000 have been wounded and some 1.5 million have been forced to flee their homes. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has warned that further escalation will prove catastrophic for the 5.2 million people living in the midst of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Since the announcement of the Minsk ceasefire in September 2014, the militants have grabbed at least 550 square kilometres of Ukraine’s territory, and they keep on grabbing more. Their advances have been buttressed by an ongoing influx of Russian arms and sophisticated weaponry, including that brought in under the pretext of humanitarian convoys. In the past few weeks leading to the latest ceasefire, the militant attacks have expanded in the direction of the cities of Mariupol, Kramatorsk, Artemivsk, Shchastya and others. Even as the package of measures for implementing the Minsk agreements was being drafted, reports were coming in of Russian tanks rolling on Ukrainian soil and of more casualties, including among children.
The Ukrainian city of Debaltseve is under siege even as we speak. Ukraine is holding on, trying to defend a piece of its own land, away from the ceasefire lines established in the Minsk agreements. Heavily armed criminals are continuing their onslaught against Debaltseve and are threatening to continue their deadly march up to Kharkiv and further. Yes, the Council must speak out in support of the ceasefire. But we know full well that previous ceasefires, whether declared unilaterally by the Ukrainian Government or established by the Minsk agreements in September, have been repeatedly violated. Even the most recent agreement is already being violated as we speak by Russian-sponsored militants.
Russian tanks, armoured personnel carriers, howitzers and Grad and Tornado multiple-launch rocket systems in the hands of the militants are holding the eastern part of Ukraine captive. Only the most naïve could imagine that the militants could have waged an ever-expanding war without external help. Without Russia’s direct support the so-called separatists would have fizzled out, dwindled into non-existence many months ago. Peace would have been restored and thousands of lives would have been saved. Instead, Russia has chosen to sponsor, arm and protect the militants. It is a direct party to the hostilities and bears the primary responsibility for the conflict that is tearing into Ukraine’s flesh.
The package that today’s resolution endorses is undoubtedly flawed, but it is the only thing we have. For it to work, all the parties involved, including Russia, must honour their commitments, including the Minsk agreements of September 2014, in full and in their entirety. Those agreements cannot be swept under the carpet. The package of measures agreed on as of 12 February is not and cannot be interpreted as a replacement of, or substitute for, the September 2014 accords, only as a set of measures aimed at their implementation.
We know well what needs to be done. Russian troops and armaments must be withdrawn from Ukraine’s territory. A viable mechanism monitored by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) must be established to monitor the ceasefire, and militants must stop blocking the OSCE’s access. Russia must stop supporting illegal militias operating in the eastern part of Ukraine. Ukraine must be able to re-establish control of its international border without any preconditions. Humanitarian access must be secured and respect for international human-rights and humanitarian law must be restored. All hostages and unlawfully detained persons — including Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko, a former peacekeeper and the only Ukrainian female soldier who has served with peacekeeping troops in Iraq, now being illegally held in the Russian Federation — must be released, as per the package of measures agreed on 12 February in Minsk.
Peace cannot be achieved without accountability. We have witnessed multiple times elsewhere how impunity breeds more impunity, eventually provoking new cycles of violence. The reports of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights have repeatedly pointed to the extent of the serious crimes and abysmal state of lawlessness in the militant-held areas. Only this past weekend, photos were circulating of the self-proclaimed militant chief Zakharchenko with beaten prisoners of war, another reminder of the militants’ many violations of international humanitarian law. We want to put on record our firm conviction that justice and accountability must be part and parcel of the path out of this devastating, unprovoked war against Ukraine. The perpetrators of the most serious crimes — and to find them we have only to look at the reports of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which describe many of them — including those responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, must be held to account. In that regard, we reiterate our call on Ukraine to complete its accession to the Rome Statute.
After the devastating horrors of the Second World War, Europe has shown remarkable will and ability to pursue the path of reconciliation and peace. What started with Franco-German reconciliation — the European Coal and Steel Community — became a unique model of reconciliation and integration that over time evolved into the European Union of today, a model for democracy, peace, prosperity and human rights whose appeal continues to draw European nations eager to join its ranks. It is reckless and profoundly dangerous to seek to turn the clock back on that spirit of reconciliation, solidarity and cooperation, which gave Europe and the world its longest-ever period of peace. Russia’s continued violations of the Charter of the United Nations, the Helsinki Final Act and numerous other agreements to which it is a signatory, as well as its attempts to redraw internationally recognized borders by force, threaten that peace.
In Minsk, the Presidents of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany recommitted to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine — although some of those words somehow managed to slip out of today’s resolution. We expect that commitment to be respected unconditionally by all, and by Russia in particular. We ask the United Nations to continue its active engagement in seeking a durable solution to this conflict through its good offices, mediation, monitoring of human rights and provision of humanitarian assistance. There is a pattern in this repeated taking of the floor, and usually there is one delegation that ends by taking the floor three or four times. We rarely do that, but this time I have a couple of comments. First, it is not easy for any country, be it Ukraine or any other country, to work on a constitution in conflict or at gunpoint, where there are so-called self-defenders, which is the way Russia has consistently referred to the illegal bands of militants and criminals who are better armed than many European armies.
Lithuania has no tanks — not a single one. Estonia, Latvia and so many other countries in Europe have not a single tank. How is it, then, that there are hundreds of tanks in the hands of the militants? There are hundreds of Tornados, howitzers, or whatever they are. This does not make any sense. Those things do not drop out of the sky, so somebody is supplying them. In looking at the geography, those things can come only from one direction, where the borders are completely porous and far from international eyes.
We do believe, and in our national capacity we have been telling and will continue to tell Ukraine, that it has to continue with the reforms, that it has to combat corruption and that it has to do a lot of things in order to restore the trust that had been lost over the decades, prior to this Government. But it is very difficult to take care of a constitution when guns are pointed at your head.
The other thing that struck me was basically a phrase about how Kyiv could have nobly capitulated and allowed the troops to leave. I wonder how many countries represented in this Chamber would be happy to capitulate their own city, surrounded by illegal militants, bandits and insurgents — whoever they are — far from any ceasefire zone, and to just give up part of their territory and leave, nobly?
I think it is very cynical to talk of the noble potential of the Kyiv authorities to leave and withdraw their soldiers, and of Kyiv having missed that opportunity. It is their territory and they are defending their territory. That territory is excluded from any ceasefire agreement reached at either of the Minsk negotiations. It is their own territory, and I think that any country represented at this table would do exactly the same. Any country represented here would defend its own territory to the last, and Kyiv is no exception. We have a tiny army and very small reserves of weapons. It is not exactly right to suggest that Lithuania is providing armaments to Ukraine. We have provided medical assistance; we have taken wounded Ukrainian soldiers into Lithuanian hospitals. That is true. However, it has nothing to do with all of the heavy weaponry that has been provided — we know from which side. So let us not compare forces, because Lithuanian forces — and we can revisit statistics next time — certainly have nothing to do with that. Even if we did provide some armaments, it would be a drop in the ocean. It would not make a difference.","Nigeria would like to thank the Russian delegation for the effort it has put into drafting resolution 2202 (2015), which the Council has just adopted. We were pleased to see it receive the support of all Council members. Nigeria believes it is important for the Council to send a timely and unequivocal message in support of the efforts of the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany to find a lasting political solution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
We urge all the parties to implement a comprehensive ceasefire in line with the Minsk agreements. That is a necessary first step in the search for peace. We stress that there can be no military solution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The parties should pursue a political solution through dialogue. It is important that the separatists’ concerns be addressed within the framework of a political settlement that does not compromise the independence, unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.","Jordan voted in support of resolution 2202 (2015) because we believe that a political solution is the right way to achieve peace and security and to help Ukraine regain stability. We call on the parties to fully implement the provisions of the September Minsk agreement in accordance with the specified time frame. The Minsk agreement is the main reference point upon which all successive agreements are based. Furthermore, we believe that the package of measures does not in any way alter the provisions of the Minsk agreement.
We call upon all parties to observe the agreements and to implement the measures set out therein. We also call upon them to take the necessary measures to declare a ceasefire and to withdraw heavy weaponry. In that connection, we would like to express our concern about the failure over the last two days to respect the ceasefire in Debaltseve. We also call on the secessionists to put an end to violations of the agreements.
In conclusion, we call on the parties concerned to show the seriousness required to reach a peaceful political solution that allows Ukraine to regain its territorial integrity and independence.","Chile joined the international community’s recognition of the contact group’s diplomatic efforts, which have led to the agreement on a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine. We are confident that it will contribute to ending the violence and the humanitarian crisis in the country by providing assistance through an international mechanism.
Resolution 2202 (2015), which we have just adopted, is clear sign of consensus in support of those diplomatic efforts and of the ceasefire for the benefit of the protection of civilians. We view very positively the inclusion of the reference to resolution 2166 (2014) in the adopted text. We are confident that the measures set forth in the 13 points of the agreement reached at the Minsk summit on 12 February will be implemented by all parties for the benefit of the population that has been affected by the crisis.
We emphasize the need to respect the independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. We call on all parties to fully comply with the provisions of the ceasefire in order to guarantee that a sustainable political solution is agreed that ensures peaceful coexistence based on the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, thereby building lasting peace.","We would like to commend the Russian Federation for initiating today’s resolution 2202 (2015), as well as all the countries that made positive contributions to its final draft. Chad welcomes its unanimous adoption by the members of the Security Council, who once again demonstrated their unity and responsibility in the face of the gravity of the situation in Ukraine, particularly in its eastern region. We appreciate the measures being taken to implement the Minsk agreements, and in that regard we urge all the parties to begin working immediately to put the resolution’s provisions into practice in order to arrive at a lasting political solution to the crisis in Ukraine.",,,,,,,,
S/PV.7368,26/01/2015,"Escalation of the conflict in Donbas in connection with the bombing of Donetsk, Horlivka, and Mariupol","I thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing. In recent days, we have witnessed a drastic deterioration in the situation in eastern Ukraine, with frequent clashes and attacks that have caused heavy casualties among civilians, including women and children. China condemns all violent attacks aimed at civilians and expresses its condolences to the victims and its sympathy to their families. We support the conduct of an objective investigation of the relevant attacks to determine the truth and bring the perpetrators to justice. Last week, the Security Council held a public meeting on the question of Ukraine (see S/PV.7365). The relevant Member States called on the parties to the conflict to take effective measures to as to avoid any escalation of the conflict or confrontation. However, much to our distress, the situation in eastern Ukraine has not improved but, on the contrary, escalated, resulting in a considerable loss of civilian life and property. China is deeply concerned at the recent developments in the situation. The deterioration of the situation in eastern Ukraine is not in the interest of any party. What is most urgent now is for all parties to be calm and exercise restraint so as to avoid any further escalation of the conflict or confrontation, to bring about a ceasefire and stop the violence in eastern Ukraine and to implement comprehensively the Minsk agreement reached in September. All of the parties concerned must make effective efforts to achieve the aforementioned objectives. Current developments in the situation clearly demonstrate that in dealing with the situation in Ukraine, it is necessary to abide by the overall objective of seeking a political settlement; to fully consider the complex historical factors and the reality of the issue relating to Ukraine; to take into full account the legitimate rights, interests and demands of all regions and ethnic communities in Ukraine; and to attach great importance to addressing the legitimate concerns of all parties and ensure that the interests of all sides are accommodated in a balanced manner, so as to arrive at a fundamental and enduring solution to the question of Ukraine. The international community must make greater diplomatic efforts to promote the quest for a political settlement of the issue. Discussions held by the Security Council must play a constructive role in helping to ease the situation in Ukraine. China has consistently held that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected. Chinas has adopted an objective and fair position concerning the question of Ukraine. We support the relevant parties of the international community in their efforts to seek a political settlement of the question of Ukraine. China calls on all parties to make greater efforts and to bring into full play the role of the Normandy and Minsk mediation mechanisms. We hope that through an inclusive political dialogue, and on the basis of accommodating the legitimate interests and concerns of all parties, it will be possible soon to reach a comprehensive balanced and lasting political settlement to achieve peace, security stability and development in Ukraine and the region as a whole. China will continue to play an active and constructive role in the quest for a political settlement of the question of Ukraine. ","I thank Mr. Feltman for his briefing. We would have all wished to see 2015 begin under better auspices for Ukraine and its stability. The year has barely started, and twice in less than a week the situation on the ground has forced us to meet here. The spiral of chaos, which started two weeks ago after several months of relative calm, could not be halted these past few days — quite the contrary. The deaths of 13 civilians in Volnovakha on 13 January, as well as the shelling of a trolleybus in Donetsk last week, which claimed at least eight civilian victims, were already a source of concern, even as the previous day the Russian, Ukrainian, French and German Foreign Ministers had been able to reach an agreement on the withdrawal of heavy weaponry. On Saturday and Sunday in Mariupol, separatist groups attacked residential neighbourhoods with rockets, killing nearly 30 civilians and instilling terror among the population. All reports from the ground, in particular those of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe observers, confirm this. More than a further violation of the ceasefire, this is also a serious violation of the international humanitarian law that protects civilians. These acts are unacceptable as they indiscriminately target civilians. The offensive against Mariupol, which was provocatively welcomed by Alexander Zakharchenko last Saturday, violated the commitments undertaken by the parties last September in Minsk and is entirely unacceptable. Let us not mince words. By supporting the Ukrainian separatists and their actions, Russia bears a significant share of responsibility for the violence. We must now turn to dialogue and seriously discuss the future of Ukraine and how to restore peace. We also call on Russia to stop supporting the separatists, who are hell- bent on destabilizing the situation. We call for a long- overdue end to the transfer of weapons and manpower across the Russian-Ukrainian border, which is fuelling the war and violates the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the most fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and which undermines diplomatic efforts seeking to settle the conflict in accordance with international law and the fundamental rights and freedoms of all Ukrainians, including its minorities. We urge Russia to use all its influence on the separatists in the east of the country so that they fully respect the ceasefire. The statements made by Mr. Lavrov today, announcing the facilitation of contacts between the warring parties, are a positive sign but they are not enough. We also call on Ukraine to begin the institutional reform as per its commitments. President Poroshenko has spoken publicly of the prospects for national dialogue and institutional reform. That statement was a further step towards the comprehensive implementation of the Minsk accords, which are the only way to achieve a negotiated solution to this crisis. The international community will judge the good faith of the parties not on mere statements but on concrete and verifiable actions that prove their genuine commitment to de-escalation. We must also call on all parties to refrain from attacking the civilian population, to respect international humanitarian law and to ensure humanitarian access to the wounded and to civilians in need of assistance. We must underscore that there can be no military solution to this conflict. Only by all parties fully implementing the Minsk accords and resuming serious diplomatic discussions, in the context of the trilateral contact group, can there be a positive outcome to this crisis. Every efforts must be made to that end. In this difficult context, we cannot afford to let down our guard. France remains and will remain fully mobilized to achieving a peaceful settlement. Our goals are clear and consistent: respect for the ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weaponry on each side of the contact line, a resumption of prisoner exchanges, the resolution of humanitarian issues and the implementation by the parties of all measures under the Minsk accords. France will pursue its efforts, in close contact with our German partners and the Russian and Ukrainian authorities, under the so-called Normandy format. We have no time to waste. This is not the time for prevarication or hypocrisy. Today we must urgently end this conflict, which has already claimed more than 5,000 lives and exacted too high a price from Ukraine, from Russia, from the European Union and from the international system as a whole. ","The Russian Federation is seriously concerned about the escalation of the situation in Ukraine. Cities in south-east Ukraine have been subjected to indiscriminate shelling by heavy weaponry for countless days, resulting in hundreds of civilian casualties. We resolutely condemn such actions against the civilian population. Of course, we sympathize with all those who have suffered, regardless of which city or village the tragedy occurred. Since the beginning of January, the armed forces of Ukraine have fired virtually non-stop on the largest city in Dombas — Donetsk. Just over the past week, at least 27 civilians have died and 71 people have been injured, and 105 residences and 3 hospitals, as well as 2 kindergartens and 3 schools, have also been destroyed. Overall, 2,367 residential buildings have been destroyed. There has also been intensive shelling against Horlivka — something that the Western media seem not to refer to. That is also something not raised here in the Chamber by either our Western colleagues or by the representatives of the Kyiv authorities. The last week was the most difficult for Horlivka since last summer: 107 people died, including 9 children. Three hundred and seventeen people have been injured. Hospitals, 15 schools and dozens of preschools have been damaged. On 21 January approximately 10 civilians died as a result of the shelling of the city of Stakhanov, Luhansk oblast, using Uragan multiple rocket launcher systems. On 21 January approximately 10 civilians died. That is far from a comprehensive list of all the cities under the control of self-defence formations in which civilians are dying every day. Yet the news cycles over the past few days have focused on two incidents alone: the shelling of a bus in Volnovakha and that of a residential neighbourhood in Mariupol. It is quite clear why: both cities are controlled by Kyiv’s forces. A similar tragedy in Donetsk in which a bus stop was shelled did not lead to mourning in Kyiv or to the convening of emergency meetings of the Security Council. It was not even worthy of a statement by the Secretary-General. Is it that in the areas and cities controlled by the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics we have second class citizens? It is impossible not to look at the fact that Kyiv has used the tragedies of recent days to fan the flames of hysteria. Accusations against self-defence formations are voiced immediately after events occur — almost as if they have been prepared in advance. Calls immediately emanate from Kyiv to Western capitals for financial and military assistance and for exerting pressure on the Russian Federation. However, as soon as the propaganda value ends, interest falls away very quickly in using the situation further and continuing investigation — all the more so given that, once some time has passed, one finds that the facts sometimes fall quite short of what was said initially. That is why we call for objective investigation of the January tragedies in Volnovakha, Donetsk and Mariupol, as well as earlier tragedies, including in the Maidan, Odesa and Mariupol. On Saturday, the members of the Security Council were not able to agree on a statement to the press with regard to the tragedy in Mariupol. The need to issue a statement was as evident to us as it was in the cases of Volnovakha and Donetsk, and we were ready to back a similar text. Why has it not been possible this time? The answer is simple: the delegations of the United States, the United Kingdom and Lithuania insisted on including in the text condemnation of one statement by the leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, taken out of context of recent events and the entire crisis in Ukraine. That is something that has been pushed here at this meeting as well. But what is the full picture of what has taken place? First, the leaders of the self-defence formations made different statements the day before yesterday. One cannot cite them selectively or take them out of context. Secondly, we have never heard anything from our Western colleagues in condemnation of the leaders of Ukraine, who have no shame when it comes to their statements and actions. There are threats that Dombas is going to be punched in the mouth, that it will be taken back by force and that it will be Ukrainized — and that the population has to prepare for “a major continental war”, to which there is allegedly no alternative. Almost a week ago, no one other than Ukrainian President Poroshenko publicly declared the resumption of military activities. That took place just a few days after the meeting in Berlin of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Germany, Russia, Ukraine and France, at which they backed the idea of a speedy beginning to the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the line of contact as set out in the Minsk memorandum of 19 September 2014. We should also remind our colleagues that Russian Security Council draft documents on very important issues — putting an end to the blood-letting, the humanitarian situation in Dombas — were repeatedly unsuccessful. Take, for instance, a press statement in support of the Minsk agreements blocked by Lithuania and the United States of America, which was immediately submitted after they were made public, on 22 September. Following the shelling of a public transport stop in Donetsk, which was clearly carried out by Ukrainian forces, for a day we had to swat away unconstructive amendments by a number of delegations. It was by exerting pressure that we were able to agree to a text at the end of the day. In the case of Volnovakha, we agreed with the text that was proposed by the sponsors within one minute. What is unfortunate is that throughout this entire conflict our Western colleagues have spent all their time accusing the self-defence formations of inhuman crimes, while they fully justify the actions of the Kyiv authorities. We have seen no constructive attempts to discuss the real reasons for the Ukrainian internal conflict and try to find a way out of the current situation. The escalation of the situation in Dombas was the result of the Kyiv authorities consistently rejecting direct dialogue with Donetsk and Luhansk on the issue of the practical implementation of the Minsk agreements. During all of last September, we noticed the steps taken by the Kyiv forces to strengthen their military positions in the south-east. They deployed forces, equipment and heavy weaponry along the line of contact, as well as calling for new mobilizations and putting in new factory orders for defence equipment. Measures for the economic reconstruction of Dombas were replaced by attempts to suppress the regions beyond their control. First they stopped paying pensions and social benefits, and then imposed a blockade on humanitarian assistance. All the while, Kyiv was preparing for war — something they did not hide in any way. History knows no “if”. But everything could have been quite different if the Minsk ceasefire memorandum had been implemented in a timely manner, including the handing over of heavy weaponry and handing over the Donetsk airport to the self-defence formations. We would have avoided a new cycle of confrontation had the Ukrainian authorities accepted the 15 January proposal of Russian President Vladimir Putin on the immediate withdrawal of heavy weaponry. It is quite clear that peace in Dombas is something that is undesirable to the “war party” in Kyiv. The Kyiv authorities have been sabotaging the holding of a regular meeting of the contact group in Minsk, unjustifiably conditioning it on high-level representation by the self-defence formations. The main thing now is to hold this meeting and not to quibble over the level of the participants. We are trying, as far as possible, to identify contacts for the meeting over the next few days. We will continue to prompt the parties towards direct dialogue, as we have done during the whole course of the internal Ukrainian crisis. In that respect, we urge the representatives of States that possess some form of influence with Ukraine’s leadership, especially Washington, D.C., to stop egging on the Ukrainian hawks, covering and justifying their inhumane actions, and pushing them towards a military solution to the conflict. That will only lead to an even greater catastrophe and create another hotbed of tension in Europe. All responsible members of the international community must strive to attain from Kyiv not words but actions in the interest of launching a full-fledged political settlement process. Until the Kyiv party of war understands that force alone cannot resolve the conflict, and that multiple-launch rocket systems, tactical ballistic missiles, phosphorous and cluster munitions, and renewed mobilizations will not help it, such incidents will occur over and over again. The Kyiv authorities must be forced to sit down at negotiation table with the self-defence formations. It is important that everyone understand that real results can be achieved only through direct dialogue between Kyiv and Donetsk and Luhansk, which the Ukrainian authorities have shirked thus far, having chosen a course of suppressing south-eastern Ukraine by military means. Without inclusive, direct political dialogue, which should allow us to properly negotiate the parameters for constitutional reform as required by the Geneva communiqué and the Minsk agreements, the national reconciliation of Ukraine and a sustainable settlement in the south-east will not occur. I would like to make a number of substantive comments. However, by way of introduction, I would like to again revisit the topic of what took place in Mariupol and the fact that the Security Council was not in a position to condemn or speak to that tragedy. A number of my colleagues have referred to this, including my Ukrainian colleague. Even when compared to his usual standards, he has really misstated the position of the Russian Federation. First, we always condemn all attacks on all civilians, and we mourn the deaths of all civilians. This is quite different from the authorities in Kyiv, who say they mourn the deaths of civilians but clearly indicate which civilians and from which regions. The fact that hundreds of individuals are dying from Ukrainian rockets and snipers does not interest them. They continue to view Donbas as Ukrainian territory. If one does not consider it to be Ukrainian territory anymore, one should just say so clearly. That would simplify things. Secondly, we always condemn the deaths of innocent people, and we stood ready to do so in the case of Mariupol as well. The fact that we were not able to do so was the result of the sloppy diplomacy conducted by a number of our colleagues using methods they have resorted to in the past with respect to the Ukrainian crisis, when they have come up with wording that is quite clearly unacceptable to one member of the Security Council. Have they ever condemned the inhumane statements that we hear from the authorities in Kyiv? Not once. Why is it that they all fixate on the statements of one leader of the self-defence formations and insist that we have to condemn them? It is quite clear that we are not acting fairly here, because a statement condemning what happened in Mariupol would have been adopted in just a few minutes, just as we adopted a statement condemning what took place in Volnovakha, which we immediately agreed to. Thirdly, we have always been in favour of objective investigations in such cases. Of course, one does not want to bring to the Security Council the work of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission. In this case, however, it seems to us that the members of the Monitoring Mission did not act appropriately. The members of the Mission, which included individuals from the United States, took a look the site of the tragedy in a very cursory way and then immediately came up with a statement. That runs counter to the traditional and agreed methods of work of the OSCE. Again, in this situation we see a case in which tragic events have clearly been exploited for political ends. Allow me to now move on to the more substantive part of our discussion. Regrettably, our meeting here today reminds us of a great many previous meetings, although the focus is perhaps a little different than before. Many colleagues today have focused on the statements made by the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. I remind Council members that Donbas has been shelled for months by Ukrainian rockets and artillery. Therefore, it is quite clear that we cannot expect conciliatory statements from the leaders of the Donetsk People’s Republic. They have been trying for month to push the rockets and artillery of the Ukrainian forces back far enough so that they could not threaten Donetsk and Luhansk. That, too, is a goal of the Minsk agreements and underscores the importance of implementing them. We have received much information here today, but we need to look at the roots of the problem. We need to understand what is meant by the thesis that the conflict in eastern Ukraine cannot be resolved by military means. We referred to this in the Security Council during the early phase of the conflict. Ukrainian tanks cannot simply move into Donbas. Unfortunately, that was part of the Poroshenko peace plan, which, in essence, demanded the capitulation of the self-defence formations. That was the first step towards escalating the conflict into a catastrophe. That is unacceptable, but unfortunately we have recently seen it being pushed by certain members of the Security Council. Some Council members today have said that the insurgents and Russia need to do this, that and the other, and then we could begin the political settlement. That is the entirely wrong approach. Serious political efforts need to be undertaken right now. Direct dialogue between Kyiv and the east need to be set up. It is necessary to put an end to the game of hide-and-seek with the Constitution, which needs to be discussed at a all-Ukraine level. Today, Mr. Feltman said that Mr. Poroshenko had agreed to a return to the Geneva format. Frankly, I am not familiar with the fact that Russia had agreed to a change in the format, but as far as I know Moscow is very flexible when it comes to the format. We stand ready to work in any format that would have a chance of yielding genuine progress in favour of a settlement. I wish to underscore, however, no discussion regarding one format or another should serve as a pretext to move away from direct dialogue between Kyiv and the representatives of the regions, first and foremost the east  I am a little surprised at our Ukrainian colleague has begun to argue using concepts that I did not voice during my comments in the Council today. But it is good that he he has remembered them and that he deems it necessary to continue to argue about things that are simply not subject to argument, concerning Stepan Bandera and other related matters. I am, however, puzzled by something else. I am gratified by the fact that our Ukrainian colleague has assimilated the English language and that he speaks it so well, but I am just stunned by the fact that he has forgotten his Russian, because only a few moments ago I explained the thrust of the problem facing the east. Instead of simply accepting that and building a political position based on it, we hear the same old propaganda. That is quite regrettable.  ","I would like to thank Mr. Feltman for his briefing this afternoon. This weekend, we saw the biggest single loss of civilian life in the Ukrainian crisis since the commitments made at Minsk on 5 September last year. Thirty civilians were killed and over 100 wounded following what the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) termed “an extremely heavy barrage” of rockets fired indiscriminately into the crowded streets of Mariupol. Only three days earlier, the Council had met to raise our serious concerns at the escalation in fighting along the agreed ceasefire line (see S/PV.7365). All of us called for de-escalation and a resumption of dialogue. That attack, many kilometres over the agreed ceasefire line, has taken the scope and threat of the conflict to a substantially new level. The attack was just not another refusal of the separatist leadership to abide by the commitments made at Minsk; it was a provocative and reckless escalation that, as the Secretary-General has made clear, could constitute a violation of international humanitarian law. Those responsible for the attack must be held accountable for their actions. It is deeply regrettable that the Council failed to agree on a press statement that would have condemned the announcement of a separatist offensive against Mariupol and the subsequent attack on Mariupol. No one in the Council can deny the fact that the attack on Mariupol, like last week’s on a bus near Volnovakha, came from the Russian-backed separatists. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission analysis of both attacks indicates clearly that in both incidents the rockets were fired from separatist-held territory. The attack would not have been possible without the military support of Russia and its supply of multiple-launch Grad and Uragan rocket systems to the separatists. In the past few weeks, Russia has transferred to the separatists hundreds of additional heavy weapons, not just rocket systems but also heavy artillery, tanks and armoured vehicles. Hundreds of Russian regular forces and special forces continue to operate on Ukrainian territory, in clear violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. These soldiers are backed by Russian command-and-control elements, air defence systems, drones and electronic warfare systems. There is no doubt that the flow of heavy weapons across those borders, in violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, has given the separatists the fire power and the confidence to escalate the conflict. Since the Minsk agreement in September, which included an immediate ceasefire, the separatists have taken control of an additional 550 square kilometres of territory. Despite the commitments made at Minsk to securing continuous monitoring of the border with verification from the OSCE, hundreds of kilometres of border remain free for the flow of these deadly weapons, often under the guise of humanitarian convoys. Russia’s persistent blocking of the proposed expansion of the OSCE border monitoring reveals its true intentions. Russia arms the separatists, it finances them, it advises them, and it fights covertly alongside them. What it has not managed to do is to get its separatist proxies to stick to Russia’s deceitful narrative. The self- proclaimed leader of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko, proudly announced on 24 January that “Today an offensive was launched on Mariupol. This will be the best possible monument to all of our dead”. That statement, and others like it, cannot be glibly ignored, as the Russian representative encourages us to do. It is the reality. While Russia professes adherence to the Minsk agreement and the Normandy format meetings, and while it accuses the Ukrainian Government of provocations, the separatist forces that it supports are bent on undermining those agreements, attacking civilians and creating new realities on the ground. That approach, as we have seen in Mariupol this weekend, will only lead us closer to the precipice. It will lead to more deaths, more destruction and more people displaced from their homes. On each occasion that the Council has met to discuss Ukraine, the vast majority of its members have underlined their commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. We assert quite rightly that these are fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations. They provide the foundation for an international system that is based on rules and respect and the preservation of international peace and security. We all defend these principles because we do not want a world where borders are redrawn by force, where States are threatened and destabilized by their neighbours, and where innocent civilian populations live in fear of battle orders issued in far-off capitals. The Security Council has to make very clear where it stands against the profoundly dangerous path that Russia is pursuing in east Ukraine. That is why I urge all Council members to be clear in their messaging today. Russia must withdraw its equipment and troops. It must cease its support for the separatists, and it must effectively control its borders. It must use its influence over the separatists to stabilize the situation and prevent further dangerous escalation. It must play its full part in ensuring the immediate implementation of the Minsk protocol. Once again today, the representative of the Russian Federation has claimed that his country wants a peaceful resolution to the conflict, but such words are worthless in themselves. We need to see Russian actions to put a stop to this widening and increasingly deadly conflict. ","I thank you, Mr. President, for convening today’s urgent meeting. We are grateful for Under-Secretary-General Feltman’s thorough briefing on such short notice. Just five days ago (see S/PV.7365), we met in the Council and denounced the devastating consequences of attacks by Russian-backed separatists on civilians in eastern Ukraine, and we appealed to Russia to stop supporting, training and fighting alongside separatist forces. Members of the Council pressed Russia and the separatists not only to recommit themselves to the agreements they had made at Minsk, but actually to honour those commitments in their actions. Unfortunately, we are back in the Chamber today because Russia and the separatists have once again flouted those commitments. The targets are fresh ones, but Russia’s end goal remains the same — to seize more territory and move the line of Russian-controlled territory deeper and deeper into Ukraine. This time, however, statements by the separatists are complicating Russia’s strategy. On Friday 23 January, the de facto leader of the Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk, Alexander Zakharchenko, said “today the offensive on Mariupol begins”. He also said “there will be no more ceasefires”. He said the separatists would not stop their attacks until they had “reached the borders of the former Donetsk region”, bragging that separatist forces were now “able to attack in three directions simultaneously”. The representative of the Russian Federation today said that these are statements we have taken out of context. What context possibly justifies a massive offensive against a civilian-populated town? I would note also that attacking in three directions, as the separatist leader said his forces had the capability to do, takes a lot of weapons and forces. This capability reflects the difference made by the substantial months- long influx of Russian personnel and heavy weapons. We know that Zakharchenko said these things because he was filmed when he said them and quoted by the official Russian news agency, Tass. On Saturday, Zakharchenko told people at a rally in Donetsk “today the attack on Mariupol began”. He added that “in a few days we will encircle Debaltsevo”, a city that is 12 kilometres outside the ceasefire line established at Minsk. If only the separatists’ words had been empty bravado. Unfortunately, on Saturday the world witnessed the horrors that resulted from the separatist attack on Mariupol, a city 25 kilometres outside of the Minsk line. On Saturday alone, more than 100 people were injured in rocket attacks on the city. Approximately 30 people were killed, including women, elderly and children, one of whom was a four-year old boy. Some 40 rounds of rockets struck the city, hitting a market, homes and a school, among other civilian structures. The impartial Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine examined blast craters and concluded that they had been caused by Grad rockets fired from multi-rocket launcher systems in separatist-controlled areas. Why do these locations matter to the Russians and the separatists? Mariupol is a port city that would provide Russia with another means of supplying separatists. And controlling the city would be another step toward creating a land-bridge to illegally occupied Crimea. Debaltsevo is a strategic rail and road hub and serves as a key link between the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. It is no accident that these strategic cities are in Russia’s sights. When on Saturday members of the Council tried to issue a joint statement denouncing the civilian casualties and expressing concern about the separatist statements, Russia blocked it, as we have heard — no wonder, given that less than a day earlier Russia had been perfectly content to disseminate Zakharchenko’s statements in its State-run media. It would be strange to be concerned about statements one had encouraged and publicized, but when your State news agency circulates announcements relishing a new offensive and your diplomats refuse to express concern about them, you own not only the statements but also the offensives. Now sometimes, perhaps given the fog of this bloody war, the separatists are too explicit about their objectives. Indeed, after initially blasting around the separatists’ Mariupol ambitions in the news service, Russia began to see the same ghastly images and reports of the carnage that the rest of us saw. At that point, perhaps knowing the source of the weaponry used, Russia tried to deny any tie between the separatists and the attacks. The Russian news service Tass even tried to erase from official news stories all quotes from Zakharchenko speaking about the separatists’ attacks. It is not hard to understand why Russia does not want the world to hear separatist statements. Last Wednesday, the representative of the Russian Federation told the Council that “the Russian Federation is ensuring full compliance with the Minsk accords” (S/PV.7365, p. 7). On Saturday, however, Zakharchenko openly admitted that his forces were violating those same accords. He appeared not to have gotten the Russian memo, which clearly calls for violating the accords while pretending you are not. Despite Zakharchenko’s statements, Russia continues to try to play the international community for the fool and blame the violence on the Ukrainians. As recently as yesterday, Foreign Minister Lavrov said “the worsening situation in Ukraine was the result of constant attacks conducted by the Ukrainian Government troops, which breached the Minsk agreements”. We heard the same here today from the representative of the Russian Federation. Zakharchenko’s statements are a problem for Russia because they are too straightforward. As members of the Council know — and as, increasingly, all the world can see — the separatists he claims to lead are trained and equipped by Russia and fight with Russian forces by their side. So when Zakharchenko brags about seizing territory beyond the Minsk ceasefire line; when he announces at rallies that separatists will strike Ukrainian forces without provocation; and when he says that he is not interested in negotiating, he is not only speaking about the separatists’ intentions but also about Russia’s intentions. This offensive is made in Moscow. It is waged by Russian-trained and Russian- funded separatists who use Russian missiles and Russian tanks, who are backed up by Russian troops, and whose operations receive direct Russian assistance. Since December, Russia has transferred hundreds of pieces of military equipment to pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, including tanks, armored vehicles, rocket systems, heavy artillery and other military equipment. And in recent weeks, Russia has resupplied the separatists with hundreds of pieces of advanced weaponry, including additional rocket systems, heavy artillery, tanks and armoured vehicles. In mid to late January, notwithstanding the shootdown of flight MH-17, Russia even deployed into eastern Ukraine advanced surface-to-air missile and anti-aircraft systems, marking the highest level of Russian air-defence presence in Eastern Ukraine since September 2014. There is a direct correlation between the movement of heavy weapons and the surge in that movement across the border, and attempts by separatists to take more ground. The horror wrought by this arsenal has been deadly. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the period from 13 to 21 January was the deadliest on record since the 5 September agreement was signed in Minsk. During this time, an average of 29 people were killed each day. More than 5,000 people have been killed and almost 11,000 maimed since the conflict began in April 2014. And today, this very day, the attacks continue on the civilian-populated areas over the Minsk ceasefire lines, not only in Mariupol and Debaltsevo, but also in Pisky and Stanichno-Luhansk. To the Russians, Mariupol and Debaltsevo may just be strategic chess pieces in their effort to move the line of territory that they control, but these cities are also home to hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian civilians. Nearly 500,000 people live in Mariupol, the second biggest city in the Donetsk region, and more than 25,000 live in Debaltsevo. Mariupol is home to 92 preschools attended by 13,000 children. We continue to believe that the only solution to this situation is a political solution, not a military solution. To that end, we continue to support the efforts of the trilateral contact group, as well as the Normandy group of foreign ministers. We welcome the Normandy group’s agreement in Berlin, which recognizes the need for the full, immediate implementation of the Minsk agreement. If Russia is serious about peace, why does it not condemn the statements by separatists that they will attack Ukrainians first and accept no more ceasefires, instead of trying to erase those statements from its State-run news services? If Russia is serious about peace, why does it not pull its tanks and Grad missiles out of eastern Ukraine instead of sending in more? If Russia is serious about peace, why does it not withdraw its forces at least to the lines agreed upon at Minsk, rather than send in a huge infusion of Russian heavy weapons so as to carve out new lines? Only if Russia takes these steps will there be a chance for the political solution that is so desperately needed. ",,,,,,,,,,,"Thank you for convening today’s urgent meeting, Mr. President. I would also like to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing, and all those here whose statements supported Ukraine and expressed sympathy with my people.
Unfortunately, since the previous Security Council meeting on Ukraine on 21 January, (see S/PV.7365) the situation there has deteriorated significantly. On 24 January, Russian-backed terrorists committed another heinous crime against humanity. As a result of the shelling of residential areas in Mariupol, in eastern Ukraine, 30 civilians were killed and more than 100 wounded. According to the 24 January spot report of the Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the bombardment was carried out using multiple Grad and Uragan rockets launched from inside terrorist-controlled territory. The shelling of Mariupol began just after statements by one of the terrorist leaders about imminent attacks on Ukrainian cities, as well as a significant increase in inflows of Russian armed forces and weapons into the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. As the President of Ukraine stated,
“The bloody murder of dozens of civilians and injuries to almost 100 people by pro-Russian terrorists in Mariupol not only constitute a terrorist attack, they are a crime against humanity, and thus an issue to be considered by the tribunal in The Hague”.
Yesterday was yet another day of mourning in Ukraine. We express our gratitude to the whole civilized world for its strong solidarity with Ukraine in the wake of this horrible tragedy, for the deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and for the wishes for a swift recovery of those injured. Ukraine appreciates the Secretary-General’s clear and unambiguous statement denouncing the unilateral withdrawal from the ceasefire by the so-called rebel leadership.
In that respect, it is highly regretful that one of the permanent members of the Security Council, bestowed by the Charter of the United Nations with the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, has once again showed its utter disrespect, not only of the Charter but of human values, by blocking the Council’s condemnation of the heinous crimes against humanity committed by terrorists in Mariupol.
Today’s statement delivered by the Russian delegation made it sound as if it were not Russia that invaded, occupied and annexed a part of the Ukrainian sovereign territory of Crimea last spring. The Russian delegation’s statement today made it sound as if regular Russian troops were not in Ukrainian sovereign territory. At the last meeting of the Security Council (see S/PV.7365), I demanded an explanation as to what 16 Russian battalions and a huge number of tanks and artillery were doing in my country without an invitation. The civilized world is waiting for an explanation from the Russian side. On can find additional evidence on my Mission’s website, which we will try to send to Council members as well.
If militants and Russia had complied with the Minsk agreements, this tragedy — the most dreadful since the beginning of the Russian aggression — would not have happened. Radio and telephone conversations intercepted by the Security Service of Ukraine irrefutably indicate that the attack was organized by terrorists supported by Russia. Further evidence of that is Russia’s blocking of a draft statement by the Security Council condemning this horrible event, as well as its complete silence — not a single word of reproach — about the terrorists’ other barbaric acts in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, such as the attack on Volnovakha, the shameful behaviour with regard to Ukrainian hostages, the tragedy at the trolleybus stop in Donetsk and many other cases. Therefore, the Russian Federation, which continues to support terrorist activities and whose troops are directly involved in hostilities against Ukraine, is solely responsible for the murders in recent weeks of innocent civilians in Volnovakha, Debaltsevo, Donetsk, Mariupol and many other towns and villages in Ukraine.
We seek international support so that Russia is finally compelled to keep its promises, rein in its proxies and stop sending troops and weaponry into Ukraine. We demand that Russia fully implement the Minsk agreements, which it has thus far supported in words only, including the immediate withdrawal of all its armed forces from the territory of Ukraine, the stabilization of the Ukrainian-Russian border and the establishment of international monitoring. It should also free without any further delay Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko — who is still on a hunger strike that is endangering her life — as well as Oleg Sentsov, Alexander Kolchenko and the other Ukrainian citizens who are being held in Russia illegally.
We call on the international community to respond resolutely to the crimes of terrorists and to increase all forms of pressure on those who sponsor and support them. Our position remains constant: the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic must be recognized as terrorist organizations.
Time and again, we have called on the Security Council to finally exercise its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations so as to prevent these terrorist groups from committing their crimes. The only way to do that is to put an end to the Russian aggression against Ukraine. Today, as never before, we need joint decisive actions by the international community against terrorist organizations and those who control them.
Let me summarize my statement with the words of our President:
“We stand for peace, but we accept the enemy’s challenge. We will defend our homeland as true patriots. We will do everything to stop the pain and suffering, to return peace to each Ukrainian family — from Lviv to Luhansk, from Chernihiv to Kerch. Having united our efforts, we will defend our freedom.”
In this struggle for Ukraine, for Europe and, ultimately, for the Charter of the United Nations, we count on the Council’s solidarity and actions. My country has been mentioned once again. Ukraine has always presented facts and figures, confirmed not only by other national competent authorities, but also by many independent observers and missions of international organizations on the ground. Today, we also have a list of questions on the 16 battalions and other groups. I urge the Council to compare the figures. At the last Council meeting (see S/PV.7365), 9,000 Russian troops were mentioned. Today, we have calculated that there are around 12,000 troops, 235 tanks, 720 armoured combat vehicles and 263 artillery systems. It would be much easier for us if we received any explanation from the Russian side about what they are doing in the sovereign territory of Ukraine. It would be much easier for all of us to solve the problem if they immediately withdrew those forces and their presence in Ukraine, pursuant to the Minsk agreement.
What we have heard instead from the Russian representative in the Council today is nothing but the old, arid and constantly repeated magic mantra — fictions about coup d’etats, Bandera and Shukhevych fascists, anti-Semites, oppression of the Russian language, ignoring the rights of the Donbas population, and so on. But not even once have Ukraine and the world received even a brief and meaningful message of condolence from Russia for the victims killed by its own mercenaries in Mariupol or Volnovakha. Instead, we see how Russia helps the Russian-speaking population of Donbas: by exterminating it with Grad shelling.
I call again on the Russian Federation not to play with words or to turn Council deliberations into theatre. We have a lot of proof of its direct and indirect aggression in Ukraine. We are still restrained in calling for the Council’s full recognition that Russia is the aggressor, but that cannot last long. Russia is a sponsor of terrorism in Ukraine. We advise Russia to stop and to do what was agreed in Minsk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I thank you, Sir, for having convened this meeting. I also thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing.
Ukraine has a democratic Constitution and is implementing a process of reform. Ukraine made a decisive contribution to nuclear non-proliferation when it decided in 1994 to renounce nuclear weapons. Ukraine is a crucial player in the international order. We unreservedly support its territorial integrity. Given these facts, there should be no violence in Ukraine. However, today we are meeting once again due to an extremely serious deterioration in the situation.
Spain would have liked the Council to adopt a statement. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I therefore vigorously and unreservedly condemn the bombing of urban areas in the city of Mariupol, which claimed tens of civilian victims and injured more than 100. I express the condolences of my country and my delegation to the families of the victims and to the people and Government of Ukraine. They can count on Spain’s solidarity.
According to the information provided yesterday by the Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as related by Mr. Feltman, the rockets were launched from locations under the control of rebel groups of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. The command responsibility for these attacks must be investigated and the perpetrators held responsible and brought to justice. Like other delegations, we deplore the statement made by Alexander Zakharchenko shortly before the attack on Mariupol. The statements constitute a clear violation of the ceasefire and of the Minsk accords. The attacks against civilians are a flagrant violation of international law. International law puts obligations not only on the parties but also on those within whose capacity it is to act to prevent any further violation of international law.
Furthermore, the High Commissioner for Human Rights warned on Friday of the continued presence of foreign fighters in eastern Ukraine. According to reports, in keeping with that of the High Commissioner, they are troops of the Russian Federation. The same source confirmed the presence of sophisticated heavy weaponry in populated areas, under the control of armed rebel groups, and reported repeated violations of the human rights of the civilians trapped there and a lack of the rule of law in those areas.
The Security Council cannot remain silent. It must make itself heard clearly given this situation. We call once again for the full implementation of the Minsk memorandum and protocol, and for the immediate restoration of the ceasefire. We appeal to all those in a position to influence those responsible for their horrendous acts, in particular to Russia, to, in accordance with its status as a signatory to the Minsk accords and to the joint Berlin declaration of 21 January, as well as a member of the OSCE trilateral contact group, and in exercise of its responsibility of the Security Council, contribute to de-escalate the tensions and compel the rebel groups to renounce violence and accept the peaceful and lawful path to pursue their claims.
The violence and horrific acts of this weekend sought to derail dialogue and undermine the negotiated settlement of the crisis provided for in the Minsk accords. We must not allow this to happen.","We thank you, Mr. President, for convening this debate, and all the more so because of the failure of the Security Council over the weekend to agree to a simple and clear press statement that would have condemned the events in Mariupol. I also thank the Under-Secretary-General for his briefing, which has been very helpful to the Council.
New Zealand condemns the killing of approximately 30 people and the injuring of more than 90 civilians on 24 January in Mariupol. The reports of indiscriminate shelling of civilian populations and residential areas are deeply concerning, as indeed are the other incidents that were outlined by Under-Secretary-General Feltman. We voiced our concerns last week that the violence was escalating at an alarming rate. The Mariupol incident confirms that the situation in eastern Ukraine is now on a disastrous downward spiral. We do not take this incident in isolation. Its occurrence, magnitude and the claims made about it by the separatist leadership speak for themselves. It was a major assault on a civilian population with the sole purpose of taking and controlling the area as a result.
The most recent civilian casualties from the conflict in eastern Ukraine are completely unacceptable. We call on all sides to respect international humanitarian law and to refrain from any indiscriminate attacks. In that regard, we note that rockets have been launched indiscriminately into civilian areas — a violation of international humanitarian law. There can be no impunity for such reckless acts. Those responsible must be held accountable for their actions.
Russia’s provision of troops and materiel to the separatists is irresponsible. The threat of “a major Ukrainian war” is both chilling and wholly inappropriate, and it may now be close to a reality.
Against the mounting body of evidence, Russia is unapologetic for the role it is playing in supporting the separatists. Russia speaks about the facts. What we know for a fact is that Russia is playing a role in this conflict.
We support the promotion of a fully inclusive political dialogue. We call on Russia, instead of blaming others, to use the diplomatic and other tools it has available to ensure that the separatists respect a ceasefire. That ceasefire, as already agreed on in the Minsk accords, must be implemented immediately. The Council must also live up to its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations. We must put politics aside, difficult although that may be, and use our collective influence to stop the killing of civilians in eastern Ukraine. That must be the priority. Although this is perhaps not for today’s meeting, in future we would like to see the Council seriously consider how it can put pressure on all the belligerents to implement the ceasefire. Words may no longer be enough; more action may still be required. ","I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting. We are grateful to Under-Secretary-General Feltman for briefing us at such short notice.
Malaysia is alarmed at the escalating violence in eastern Ukraine since the last Security Council meeting on the subject (see S/PV.7365), less than a week ago. Since then we have seen a repeat of indiscriminate attacks on civilians. On 22 January a public transport stop in the city of Donetsk was shelled, with as many as 15 people killed and more than 20 civilians injured. Two days later, at least 30 people, including two children, were killed in the city of Mariupol, and more than 100 civilians injured. Malaysia condemns such indiscriminate attacks in the strongest terms. It is most unfortunate that the latest violence in Mariupol did not even merit the Security Council’s condemnation, owing to a lack of consensus among Council members on the draft press statement. Malaysia calls for an independent investigation into the incidents. The perpetrators of such heinous crimes against civilians must be held accountable. We would like to remind the parties to the conflict that they should adhere to international human-rights and humanitarian law. Attacks on humanitarian convoys must also cease immediately.
The recent events have seriously undermined the ceasefire agreement reached in September of last year between the conflicting parties. Malaysia strongly urges the relevant parties to comply with their commitments as outlined in the Minsk protocol of 5 September and the memorandum of 9 September. The latest developments in eastern Ukraine prove that a diplomatic and political solution is more urgent than ever. In that regard, Malaysia welcomes all efforts that could facilitate a de-escalation of the crisis and contribute to ending the conflict, including the possibility of resuming Geneva-format negotiations. As Malaysia stated last week (see S/PV.7365), a military solution would be in no one’s interests in the long run and would not be suitable.
Seventy years after the establishment of the United Nations, we still see blatant disregard today for the core principles of the Charter of the United Nations, particularly respect for countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity. Malaysia urges the relevant parties to reflect on the consequences of such actions for their long-term interests and international standing. We reiterate our call to the relevant parties to explore all possible avenues for finding a peaceful solution. We are committed to playing a constructive role in the Council in order to de-escalate the crisis and see talks resume so as to restore Ukraine’s stability and territorial integrity.","The delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela thanks you, Mr. President, for convening this Security Council briefing on Ukraine. We also welcome Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, and we appreciate the information he has provided to us on the political situation in Ukraine.
Our country expresses its grave concern about the recent escalation of armed conflict in eastern Ukraine, which has caused loss of civilian lives and untold numbers of injuries. Venezuela reiterates its call on the parties to promote a peaceful, negotiated, political solution to the crisis. We stress that any violent incident on the ground should be investigated independently, and that the investigation’s conclusions should be based on irrefutable evidence. Venezuela rejects any act of violence or terrorism, in particular attacks against civilians, from wherever they originate.
The intensification of the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine makes it imperative that the parties put an end to their hostilities in the area. The ceasefire is therefore a crucial step.
It is necessary to continue on the path of seeking a political and diplomatic solution to the Ukrainian crisis, in which the conflicting parties commit to working on achieving a firm and lasting peace.
The mediation efforts by regional organizations is, in our view, particularly important in the process of finding a negotiated settlement to the conflict. In that regard, we reiterate our support for the efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Germany and France to promote dialogue among Ukraine, Russia and the representatives of the Donbas region. We also welcome the joint communiqué issued on 21 January in Berlin by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine, and we encourage the parties to work together for its implementation.
The Minsk agreements are the basis on which lasting peace can be achieved in the region. We reiterate that any intervention by outside elements that violate the Minsk agreements and regional efforts to reach an agreement between the parties should be avoided.
Venezuela stresses that the parties must act with a sense of restraint in order to prevent the dialogue from being undermined by unilateral actions that jeopardize the peace process. The cycle of violence must be broken. Building the foundation for peace involves putting an end to hate speech, ethnic persecution and war propaganda. The historic and root causes of the conflict must be addressed and a political agreement between the parties must be sought.
The escalation in hostilities requires strict compliance by the belligerent parties with obligations concerning the protection of civilians in the areas affected by violence, including the need to ensure humanitarian access to internally displaced persons, refugees and others residents in areas affected by the conflict.
Finally, we again call on all parties to redouble their efforts in the search for a just and lasting political solution, which is in their own interests and those of the entire region.","I am grateful to you for convening this meeting, Mr. President, and would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing on the outbreak of hostilities in eastern Ukraine.
In our meeting on Wednesday, 21 January
(see S/PV. 7365), the Angolan delegation expressed its position on the issue in the wake of the attack on a bus in the Donetsk region that resulted in a number of civilian casualties. We would like to take this opportunity to reiterate our position, while condemning the recent attack on Mariupol and the loss of life and extensive destruction of property. I will be brief.
We regret the loss of lives in the recent outbreak of hostilities in eastern Ukraine and emphasize the urgent need to protect civilians. We condemn the violations of the ceasefire and urge all the parties to observe it. We believe that the Minsk accords constitute a framework for a peaceful solution to the conflict, and we urge all parties to abide by them. We stress the importance of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Finally, we believe it is crucial that humanitarian assistance be provided to the victims of the conflict and that efforts stepped up to help the thousands in need.","I would like to thank you, Sir, for convening this urgent meeting on the situation in Ukraine. Let me also thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing and insights into the current situation.
Lithuania condemns in the strongest terms the attacks on Mariupol and extends its sincere condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives or have been injured during these attacks.
The bloodiest conflict in Europe since the Balkan wars is taking place as we speak. Last Wednesday in this Chamber (see S/PV.7365), the Security Council members once again expressed concern at the situation and urged all parties to the conflict, including Russia, to return to the Minsk agreements and ensure their prompt and full implementation in order to prevent even more destruction and bloodshed. Alas, what we saw over the weekend was more deadly shelling, more destruction, and more human tragedy caused by the Kremlin’s unbridled mercenaries, including the deadly attack on Mariupol, which this Council failed to condemn because Russia put protecting the militants above condemning the perpetrators.
After 29 open briefings and no progress on the ground, it is hard not to sound repetitive here. However, we cannot let Ukraine fall through the cracks of international attention. More than 5,000 dead, some 11,000 injured and about 1.5 million displaced — such is the cost of Russia’s continued aggression against Ukraine. Almost 50,000 people have fled their homes since 14 January; at least 262 people were killed between 13 and 21 January alone. Last week again, from 75 to 115 shelling attacks on Ukrainian positions took place every day. The Donetsk airport, which the Kremlin-sponsored militants captured last week, has been pounded to rubble by months of attacks, causing destruction seen only in the worst of wars. Some 550 square kilometres of land have been captured by the illegal militants since the beginning of the ceasefire. Such are the realities of what we continue to call a ceasefire.
Just like the breaches of the 1991 Alma Ata Declaration, the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, the 1997 Black Sea Fleet Agreement Between the Russian Federation and Ukraine and various other documents, including the more recent the Geneva statement and the Berlin joint declaration, the Minsk agreements are just another casualty of Russia’s aggression against neighbouring Ukraine.
One does not seek peace by arming illegal fighters in a neighbouring country with advanced artillery systems, multiple rocket launchers, truckloads of arms and ammunition, and tanks. One does not seek peace by sending one’s own troops and commandos to fight on the soil of one’s neighbour. One does not seek peace by issuing continuous threats and intimidations vis-à-vis one’s neighbour, or by annexing parts of the neighbour’s territory. One does not seek peace by unleashing a continuous barrage of hate-mongering propaganda and lies aimed at dehumanizing and demonizing one’s neighbour. As long as Russia persists on this course, let us be frank, peace in Ukraine has no chance.
Last Saturday, Ukraine suffered the second deadliest single incident on its soil since the downing of flight MH-17 in July 2014. Some 30 people were killed and about 90 wounded during the shelling of the city of Mariupol. The Under-Secretary-General spoke of the militants withdrawing unilaterally from the ceasefire. In the days preceding the attack, Alexander Zakharchenko, the self-proclaimed boss of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, repeatedly stated his disdain for the ceasefire. “There is no ceasefire. We will fight. I promise,” he said. “There will be no more ceasefires or rotations ... There will be no attempts to talk about ceasefire from our side. Kyiv does not understand that we are now able to attack on three fronts at once.”
And then hours before the tragedy, he said: “Today the offensive against Mariupol begins. In a few days we will swallow the Debaltsevo kettle”. Notably, a day before the deadly attacks, Russia’s Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) anticipated Mariupol’s “liberation” in an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.
And yet, in spite of the obvious, Russia continues to blame Ukraine for ceasefire violations, including the Mariupol attack. Anti-Ukrainian rhetoric is not abating. Last week in this Chamber, we heard the long-debunked myths of “the junta”, “the coup”, “fascist Ukraine”, and “oppression of Russian speakers” being once again resuscitated and put into use. For a year now, aggressive anti-Ukrainian propaganda has been used to brainwash, confuse, distract and obfuscate.
The international community should not and must not give in to these obfuscations. Therefore, let me ask again: How can a bunch of illegal militants expand their offensive, continue capturing territory and threaten to carry out attacks on three fronts against the State of Ukraine? How can a bunch of illegal militants without external trade ties, income or budget amass hundreds of armored combat vehicles, artillery systems and rocket launchers — all those Tochka-U tactical missile launch systems, Grad rockets, Uragan and Buratino rocket launchers? How can they afford modern tanks, each of which costs at least $4 million? How can they claim their own air fleet? How can hundreds of Russian soldiers be dying on Ukraine’s soil if they are not even there?
How come hundreds of Russian mothers receive the dead bodies of their sons in Cargo 200 boxes from a conflict to which Russia claims it is not a party? How come, in spite of the devastating lawlessness and countless crimes committed by the separatist militants and registered in the reports of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Russia has not even once, not even mildly, condemned the perpetrators? All of this, as well as Russia’s persistent protectiveness of the illegal militants, speak to Russia’s direct involvement in and support for the war in Ukraine.
That involvement has been confirmed by certain militant leaders. Back in August last year, the same Alexander Zakharchenko said that thousands of Russian citizens, including many professional soldiers, were fighting alongside the separatists. And then he suddenly withdrew his statement, just as he retracted his boasting about the attack on Mariupol on Saturday. Another notorious character, the Russian commando Igor Girkin — who is also known as Strelkov and who played a big role in stoking war in eastern Ukraine —recently boasted to the press about having started the war by crossing the border with his squad, saying that if it had not been for them, there would have been no separatism in eastern Ukraine. A few days ago, he also said the Crimea referendum was carried out at gunpoint — something many of us have been repeating since the bogus plebiscite was held.
Life in eastern Ukraine may have been far from perfect due, to long years of neglect by successive Governments, yet the local inhabitants, many of them Russian speakers, had homes to return to after work, had their daily lives and had their daily bread. Thanks to the Kremlin’s decision to “protect” Russian speakers, they now have no homes, no jobs and no income and may have lost dear ones or may be dead themselves. Russia’s war, Russia’s proxies and the abysmal lawlessness they imposed have brought destruction, displacement and death to the region.
In spite of all the ceasefire violations and military attacks, the Ukrainian leadership firmly maintains that the Minsk agreements are the only way forward towards peace. However, the Minsk agreements must be implemented by all the parties to the conflict — Russia included — in full and without arbitrary revisions or manipulation. The onus is on Russia to put an end to this senseless war by ending support to illegal armed groups, accepting international monitoring of the Ukrainian-Russian border, withdrawing its troops and weaponry from eastern Ukraine, ensuring the release by the illegal militants of all illegally detained persons, including Nadiya Savchenko — who is being held illegally on Russian territory — ending the manipulation of humanitarian assistance and reaffirming its respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity. International observers, including the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe monitoring missions, must be provided full and unconditional access to the entire territory of Ukraine, including Crimea. Their reporting is indispensable to get the facts straight. ","I also thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing.
Since the Council’s meeting last week on the situation in Ukraine (see S/PV.7365), the conflict in the country has intensified, and civilians continue to suffer the consequences. The rocket attacks on Mariupol, which left 30 people dead and more than 100 injured, including women and children, serve to illustrate this point. Nigeria condemns in the strongest terms indiscriminate attacks on residential areas. They serve no military purpose, they violate international law and they are unacceptable.
We call on both sides to immediately de-escalate the fighting and respect the terms of the ceasefire agreement reached at the Minsk peace talks. We stress that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Ukraine. The parties should seek a political solution through dialogue. It is important that the concerns of the separatists be addressed within the framework of a negotiated political settlement. That should be done without compromising the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine.","I would like to sincerely thank the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, for his informative briefing.
Jordan regrets certain parties’ disregard of the several calls made for a ceasefire either by the Security Council or the international community as a whole. We also regret the continued escalation of the crisis and the violation of the Minsk peace agreement. Jordan expresses its deep concern at this serious escalation of violence and fighting, which could have grave consequences and lead to the further deterioration of the situation in eastern Ukraine and the region.
Jordan strongly condemns the targeting and intimidation of civilians as well as the shelling of residential areas, regardless of the source, and calls for the conduct of a thorough and transparent investigation into the incident involving the shelling of a bus stop in Donetsk and the appalling incident that took place in Mariupol two years ago, which is considered to be the bloodiest incident since last July’s peace agreement. We also call for the bringing to justice of all of the perpetrators of these criminals acts.
This serious setback in the situation in eastern Ukraine and the spread of the fighting to other cities makes it incumbent on all parties to hold an emergency meeting to continue the negotiations based on previous agreements and with a view to speedily reaching a comprehensive ceasefire. A political and peaceful solution will not be possible in the context of resort to military means or unilateral measures that undermine regional and international efforts and bring the negotiations back to square one. Rather, the solution lies in the effective measures that lead to peace and calm.
Jordan calls on all States with influence on the separatists to urge them to refrain from the use of force and to cease all violations, which can lead only to further instability in Ukraine.
We call once again on all parties involved in this conflict to shoulder their responsibilities, to immediately implement a ceasefire and to stop all escalatory measures, including provocative and irresponsible speech by any party. We in the Council and at the international level as a whole should redouble our efforts and do our utmost to prevent the collapse of all the progress that has been achieved over the past year, so as to achieve a comprehensive agreement that takes into account all of the interests of the different parties.
We would conclude by stressing the importance of preserving the country’s unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty, of non-interference in its internal affairs, of the proper control of its borders and of the cessation of flows of separatists and foreign fighters and weapons into Ukrainian territory. We also stress the importance of the full implementation, in letter and in spirit, of the Minsk peace agreement and of the memorandum issued later, as well as of the joint statement by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine on the establishment of a communication line.","I shall now make a statement in my capacity as representative of Chile.
We would like to thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing on the recent events in Ukraine.
We join in the condemnation of the indiscriminate shelling of residential areas in the city of Mariupol, an attack that constitutes a significant and worrying escalation of the level of violence in eastern Ukraine. Those responsible for such deplorable acts against the civilian population must be held accountable, and we emphasize the absolute necessity for an objective investigation of the facts that will see that those responsible are brought to justice.
The violence must end so that Ukrainians can rebuild their lives in a stable and secure country, while maintaining its sovereignty and territorial integrity in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. We urge the parties to fully implement the Minsk agreements, which, along with the ceasefire memorandum of 19 September, have laid the foundations and established the criteria for a negotiated solution to the crisis.
We furthermore recall that in Minsk all parties agreed to allow the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to monitor and verify the ceasefire. We emphasize our support for the OSCE’s Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine and urge the parties to cooperate with its mandate, particularly through support for the delivery of humanitarian aid. I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.
I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine.","I, too, should like to thank Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing.
Chad is deeply concerned at the deterioration of the security situation in Ukraine, especially in the region of Donetsk and Luhansk. Despite the untiring calls made by the international community for restraint and calm, a violent attack on the port of Mariupol in the Donetsk region took place on Saturday, 24 January, resulting in at least 30 civilians killed and more than 100 injured. On 13 January, we saw the shelling of a bus near Volnovakha that claimed the lives of 12 civilians, the majority of whom were women. The situation is a serious one. Given the lack of political will when it comes to putting an end to the violence, and the significant increase in the number of civilian victims, Chad is fearful of a resumption of the fighting, whose primary victims will, as always, be civilians.
Developments in terms of the violence in Ukraine very often lead to violations of international humanitarian law, and the international community cannot remain impassively on the sidelines. Those who are responsible must be brought to justice.
With more than 5,000 deaths, 10,300 injured and more than 1 million displaced persons, the Ukrainian tragedy has gone on long enough. In that regard, Chad calls on all the parties to remain calm and show restraint and urges the Government and separatists to engage in a direct and inclusive national dialogue with a view to national reconciliation. Moreover, Chad believes that the solution to the Ukrainian crisis is political, and that it will largely depend upon the willingness of the parties concerned to commit to a true negotiations process to achieve lasting peace. Chad encourages the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to pursue its investigations with a view to assigning responsibility for the Ukrainian crisis, which has lasted far too long and caused many victims.
In line with the Normandy format and Milan meetings and the mediation provided by the trilateral contact group, Chad urges on the countries involved and the Secretary-General, through his good offices, to relaunch the peace process in Ukraine.
To conclude, we urge friendly countries with influence on the parties to bring the necessary pressure to bear with a view to achieving a lasting solution to the crisis on the basis of the Minsk agreements and declaration, with full respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.",,,,,,,,
S/PV.7365,25/01/2015,Escalation of the conflict in Donbas in connection with the clashes in the Donetsk airport and other several towns/villages,"I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing. The current situation in eastern Ukraine remains turbulent, with an increase in armed clashes and acts of violence resulting in human casualties and the destruction of property. China is deeply worried and concerned about the situation. The top priorities now are to effectively and comprehensively implement the Minsk agreements by all parties concerned, to stay calm and exercise restraint, to prevent further escalation of the conflict and confrontation and to achieve as soon as possible a ceasefire and cessation of violence in eastern Ukraine. China believes that a political solution is the only way to settle the Ukrainian issue. The crisis in Ukraine is rooted in complex historical facts and contemporary causes. A fundamental solution of the Ukrainian issue lies in fully taking into account the legitimate rights and aspirations of all regions and ethnic groups of Ukraine, while addressing the reasonable concerns of all the parties involved so that their interests can be balanced. China welcomes and supports the recent positive efforts of the relevant parties to push for a political solution to the Ukrainian issue and hopes that they will join hands, fully take into account the legitimate interests and reasonable concerns of each side and, through such mediation mechanisms as the Normandy and Minsk formats, and find a comprehensive, balanced and lasting political settlement as soon as possible in order to achieve peace, security, stability and development in Ukraine, as well as in the region as a whole. It is China’s long-standing position to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries. We support all actions conducive to the holding of dialogues and consultations in search of a political solution to the Ukrainian crisis. We will maintain our just and objective position by playing a positive and constructive role in finding a political solution to the Ukrainian issue. ","I would start by thanking Mr. Feltman for his briefing. We have heeded his warning regarding the deterioration of the security situation in Donbas over the past few days. Fighting has resumed with an intensity that we had not seen in Ukraine for several months, especially around what remains of the Donetsk airport. What is urgently needed now is to achieve a de-escalation in order to put the political dialogue back on track. The parties must understand that there can be no military solution to the conflict, which has already claimed over 5,000 lives and which entails significant costs for Ukraine, Russia and the European Union. Only the full implementation, in good faith, of the Minsk agreements by all parties will provide a way out of the crisis. Every effort must be made to achieve that goal. France remains fully mobilized with a view to achieving a peaceful and lasting settlement of the conflict, and in that context supports all international initiatives that share that goal. Minister Laurent Fabius is in close contact with his German, Russian and Ukrainian counterparts. Today in Berlin, there have been further exchanges between the Ministers under the Normandy format. Our objectives, as recently recalled by the French President, are clear and consistent: respect for the ceasefire; the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the contact line; the settlement of humanitarian issues; and, eventually, the election of new representatives in eastern Ukraine. Yesterday, the Permanent Council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in which Russia and Ukraine are represented, adopted a political statement calling for a de-escalation and the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. That is also a step in the right direction. But beyond mere words, and above all, we now need concrete and verifiable action. The Security Council, which last year dealt with the Ukrainian crisis on more than 30 occasions, should support those efforts and participate in the search for a lasting solution. The risk of the crisis spreading within Ukraine and beyond should not be underestimated. Ukraine must therefore remain at the heart of the Security Council’s priorities. However, for that same reason, we also want to open a new chapter in 2015 to find a way out of the spiral of confrontation, and we want to do so without abandoning our principles. Nothing can undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its international borders. The situation is now, paradoxically, clearer than it was a few months ago. The parameters necessary for an end to the crisis are now known to all — namely, the Minsk agreements. Against all odds, and despite alternating periods of violence — as we see now — and quiet, that road map was upheld until last week. It is not challenged by the parties. Its implementation remains very difficult. The discussions in the contact group are too slow and only lead to modest results. That is due to the significant distrust that prevails between the Russian and Ukrainian parties. That state of affairs must be overcome, and we must encourage each party to have the courage to get involved. Upstream, there is now a mechanism for validation and political impetus: the Normandy format. It seeks to encourage parties to go further and takes note of the progress made. However, much remains to be done, as the situation on the ground today makes tragically clear. We must move forward if we want diplomatic dynamics to prevail over violence and chaos. It seems clear to us that Russia is reluctant to engage openly and lastingly to normalize the situation. The recent violence is further evidence of Russia’s capacity to fuel tensions even as a diplomatic process begins. We also call on Ukraine to launch a process leading to institutional reforms giving Donbas greater autonomy while respecting the sovereignty of Ukraine. We call once again on Russia to stop the transfer of arms and individuals across the Russian-Ukrainian border. We call on Russia to bring all of its influence to bear on the separatists to ensure that the ceasefire is fully upheld. Securing the Russian-Ukrainian border remains vital to emerging from the crisis. Convoys coming from Ukraine, the European Union and, of course, Russia must all be deployed in accordance with Ukrainian law. Our policy is based on firmness and openness to dialogue. This holds in New York as elsewhere. Our resolve is unshakable alongside our European and American partners. ","The Security Council holds a large number of meetings on a number of worthwhile topics in this Chamber. We use many beautiful words about the need to peacefully settle political crises, about the impossibility of a military solution, about the rule of law, democracy and the inclusiveness of political processes and about human rights and the primacy of the protection of civilians in conflict. However, after discussing Ukraine here about 30 times, the question arises as to how well-aligned the declarations are with the situation in the country. Are they directly applicable, or are they provided just for the sake of eloquence, to be discarded when political suitability takes precedence? Are all of the resolutions and presidential statements adopted here relevant for such a country as Ukraine? The Russian Federation is ensuring full compliance with the Minsk accords to settle the Ukrainian crisis. We take that into account during contacts with the sides, including the leadership of Ukraine and the rebels and representatives of interested foreign countries, including under the Normandy format. Unfortunately, Kyiv botched the 16 January meeting of the Minsk contact group: the Ukrainian representatives did not show up at the Belarusian capital. The situation on the ground has recently worsened significantly, with the Donetsk airport becoming the epicentre of clashes. Despite the fact that, in line with the Minsk agreements, the airport was to have been given to the militias, the matter has not been resolved peacefully because of disputes in other areas of the engagement line. Ukrainian armed forces have continued to shell Donetsk and other populated areas, leading to a large number of civilian casualties. On 15 January, the President of Russia sent a letter to the President of Ukraine regarding the need to rigorously implement the silence regime, as well as about the need for a swift withdrawal of weaponry from the engagement line, in accordance with the Minsk agreements, based on coordinates that were insisted upon by the Ukrainian side — I stress that — as well as a timetable with a list of actions for the sides regarding the the withdrawal of each type of conventional and reactive artillery, also in line with time frames put forth by Ukraine. The Russian side expressed its readiness to bring its influence to bear on the militias to ensure that the option was adopted in good faith and to avoid civilian casualties, and suggested providing assistance to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) regarding monitoring of the implementation of those steps. I underscore that the letter was sent in accordance with a request discussed during telephone contacts between Russian and Ukrainian leaders. However, instead of appropriately responding to the proposal, the Ukrainian side resumed artillery shelling of Donetsk. The current escalation of the situation in Donbas is hardly fortuitous. Over the entire time of the ceasefire, the Ukrainian side violated the Minsk agreements by stepping up its military presence in the south-east of the country, there was a strengthening of militarization and regrouping, as well as new waves of mobilization appeals from Kyiv to avenge the defeats of 2014. At the same time, a number of countries actively supporting the “war party” in Kyiv irresponsibly provided Ukraine with military-purpose items. It is clear that the events of recent days are yet another attempt by Kyiv to resolve the internal political conflict militarily, which will definitely lead to exacerbating the crisis of the State of Ukraine and numerous civilian casualties. Ultimately, it is fraught with catastrophe. Many times here in the Chamber, we have pointed to the fact that those who come to power as a result of a coup d’état — the so-called Government of the victors — and while enjoying support from armed radicals are conducting a policy that has nothing in common with establishing a country of national unity. Kyiv has cast aside all instruments concerning a political settlement of the internal crisis. The 21 February agreement signed by Yanukovych and the opposition on the establishment of a Government of national unity had become a dead letter by the next day. The Geneva statement of 17 April, providing for swift and comprehensive constitutional reform involving all regions and political forces, was ignored. The road map of the Chairman of the OSCE was rejected. Has anyone here heard anything about the inclusive national dialogue referred to in the Minsk protocol? The first thing that the forces that came to power after the coup in Kyiv did was to forge ahead with decisions aimed at restricting the rights of linguistic minorities and suffocating dissidents. Despite the fact that half of the country speaks in Russian, almost all Russian-language media were closed down, Russian television broadcasts were forbidden and the political forces representing the Russian citizens in south- east Ukraine were intimidated or simply banned. The south-east and south saw horrific crimes be committed, which have not yet been brought to light or seriously investigated. On 2 May in Odessa, dozens of people were burned alive in the House of Trade Unions building. On 9 May, Victory Day in the Great Patriotic War, in Mariupol, civilians were shot. And at the beginning of in July there were again airstrikes in Luhansk. The nature and dynamics of the crisis in Ukraine are difficult to understand without an understanding of the ideological undercurrents. Last year, 14 October was declared a public holiday in Ukraine — the day of the establishment of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army — which fought on the side of the Nazis. That is an all-out glorification of Ukrainian Nazi collaborators and misanthropes Bandera and Shukhevych, who have the blood of tens of thousands of Soviet and Polish citizens on their hands. Bandera gave indiscriminate orders to execute his opponents on a massive scale, in particular on grounds of nationality. Let me recall Bandera’s words: “I will kill every Pole from 16 to 60 years of age”. Shukhevych so instructed his followers: “Do not bully; destroy! Fear not that people will curse us for cruelty. If only half of the Ukrainian population of 40 million remains, there is nothing wrong with that!” Now incendiary marches, in the style of the Waffen-SS, with portraits of the so-called “heroes of Ukraine” are held completely openly, with the approval of the Kyiv authorities. Honestly, the Ukrainian people deserve better heroes. The people of eastern Ukraine view this as Americans would feel if in the United States the founding day of the Ku Klux Klan were proclaimed a national holiday and its members marched in Washington, D.C., with burning crosses and formed detachments to be sent to other areas of the country to put things in order. However, speaking on German television, Prime Minister Yatsenyuk lamented the fact that during the Second World War “the Soviet Union invaded Ukraine and Germany”. Apparently, he would like Ukraine to remain under Nazi occupation even today. Still, enlightened Europe kept silent on the matter. Indeed, it is very strange that those who claim to be civilized can tolerate such a subversive ideology. This is the ideology guiding Kyiv’s so-called “anti-terrorist” operations, which are, in reality, punitive operations. Aircraft, heavy weaponry, artillery, banned cluster and phosphorus munitions, tactical missiles and multiple rocket launchers are being used against cities in the south- east. The confirmed death toll is approaching 5,000. Refugees and internally displaced persons number in the millions. In the city of Donetsk alone, more than 1,000 houses have been destroyed. Many small towns and other inhabited areas have been totally destroyed. There have been strikes against residential areas and infrastructure, with total disregard for international humanitarian law and basic moral decency. Even major western non-governmental organizations, which hardly sympathize with the militia, say that the Ukrainian security forces do not distinguish between military and civilian targets. Kyiv reacted immediately to a terrible incident that occurred on 13 January involving a passenger bus in Volnovakha, leveling charges at the militias without any investigation or trial. However, according to the conclusion of the OSCE Mission, the firing came from the north-north-east direction, which is an area where it is dubious rebels could be. The Ukrainian Government is using this tragedy to the full extent so as to incite militaristic hysteria. The very next day, the Ukrainian brass stepped up artillery and bomb strikes against the cities of Donbas, resulting in the deaths of dozens of civilians, including women, children and the elderly. A bus stop was hit yesterday, resulting in two deaths and 11 serious injuries. Those are just the latest such incidents. A Russian television station on the ground said that today in Donetsk eight civilians had been killed and 30 wounded, including children. Meanwhile, a Ukrainian newspaper reported that today five civilians had been killed and 29 wounded. The websites of Ukrainian militias say basically the same thing. In the city of Stakhanaov, Luhansk district, up to 10 citizens were killed today as a result of salvoes from multiple rocket launchers. However, no one in Kyiv is conducting funeral marches. It would seem that the fallen are going unnoticed. A significant military force in the south-east is made up of the so-called “volunteer battalions”, which are funded by Ukrainian oligarchs and answer to no one. Some of them openly use Nazi symbols. The Kyiv authorities, while constantly referring to the unity and territorial integrity of the country, have not taken a single step towards genuine national dialogue or constitutional reform with the participation of all groups and regions. Moreover, Kyiv is doing everything to cut off the south-east in practical terms. A decision has been made to withdraw all State institutions and terminate payments from the budget, including welfare and pensions. The movement of persons and goods is limited along the lines of engagement. Since 12 January, transportation between Ukraine and Luhansk has been at a standstill. The humanitarian situation is catastrophic. Just last summer, we raised this issue and proposed that the Council adopt a draft resolution in this regard. Some members of the Security Council, unfortunately, did not heed our call. They hushed up the topic, waxed poetic and squabbled about the number of victims required to qualify the situation as a “humanitarian crisis”. Today there is no room for demagoguery. United Nations humanitarian actors view the situation as a full-scale crisis calling for a presence on the ground, clusters for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and financing humanitarian appeals. They have recently reported a deterioration in the situation regarding the delivery of aid due to further obstruction from the Kyiv authorities. Russia is providing significant humanitarian assistance to Donbas, in spite of the controversy that some members of the Council have attempted to raise in this regard. At the same time, we continue to seek agreement with Kyiv, in spite of its obstruction, on the conditions for the provision of such supplies. We give timely information regarding sending humanitarian convoys and cargo. Aid is also going through various channels. Russia has just decided to contribute $5 million to the World Food Programme’s humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine. The Minsk agreement, signed in September by Kyiv and representatives of Luhansk and Donetsk with the mediation of the OSCE and Russia, laid the groundwork for a peaceful settlement. There is a need for the swift resumption of practical work with the contact group for their full implementation. For our part, we are doing out utmost to ensure that the next meeting in Minsk will take place as soon as possible. We urge all responsible members of the international community to put pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to move away from confrontation and bring to an end its policy on the forced suppression of the south-east. They must understand that the most pressing need now is to launch direct Ukraine-wide dialogue to discuss the constitutional makeup of the country, which should be comfortable and safe for all citizens without exception. Before the beginning of today’s meeting, we were supposed to hold closed consultations to consider whether or not the Security Council could make a contribution to settling the Ukrainian crisis. However, as colleagues have complained to us, the delegation of the United States showed its hand, and we know why. It was to create yet another propagandist controversy. The representative of the United States went beyond the Ukrainian topic and made a number of inappropriate insinuations regarding Russia’s policies. That is why we need to talk about the United States policy. Throughout the Ukrainian crisis, the United States has played a destructive and — if we are to speak frankly — a provocative role. After every visit of high-ranking United States officials to Ukraine, the Kyiv Government has stepped up the confrontational nature of its activities, and the current military escalation horrifically coincides with the visit to Kyiv of the commander of the American forces in Europe. It is surprising that wherever Washington, D.C., turns its gaze — be it Iraq, Libya, Syria, Ukraine, everywhere — we see destabilization, crises and bloodshed. Perhaps the United States believes that Europe does not have enough problems and that the eastern part of the continent needs a long, drawn-out crisis. It would seem that some European capitals — though not yet all, as demonstrated by today’s discussion — have begun to understand where things are going. Ms. Power and other colleagues talked about certain conflicts that occurred as a result of the fall of the Soviet Union, and for some reason blamed Russia for them. I recall that the conflict in Transnistria could have been settled back in 2005 if Washington, D.C., had not intervened at the last moment, convincing Chisinău not to sign the prepared agreement. Abkhazia, in South Ossetia, would not have declared its independence if in 2001 Washington, D.C., had not provoked an eruption of the already unbalanced regime of Saakashvili. I now come back to the subject of Ukraine. During today’s discussion, we have heard a number of specific grievances against Russia. I would recommend that colleagues carefully study the text of the major press conference held in Moscow today by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of our country, Mr. Sergey Lavrov, and that they reread my statement. In regard to the statement made by the Ukrainian representative, I have only one thing to say. In all our many discussions in the Security Council, the Ukrainian delegation has never uttered a respectful word and has actually been insulting when referring to the south- eastern part of his country. He uses the terms “bandits” and “terrorists”. Sometimes the Ukrainian political elite calls them “inhuman” or “insects”. I have yet to hear my Ukrainian colleagues raise the subject of inclusive political dialogue. While the Kyiv Government does not seem ready to take this up, it is now time to do so with political courage and to understand that there is no other way to keep Ukraine whole. I understand that Ms. Power decided that she had not been eloquent enough in setting out the American position, and that her Deputy needed to repeat some portions of her statement. I regret that Ambassador Power has decided not to continue this principled discussion with us on matters of international policy. ","I welcome the briefing today by Under-Secretary- General Feltman following his recent visit to Ukraine. The worrying surge in violence over the past week underlines the grave threat that the situation in eastern Ukraine continues to pose to international peace and security. We were all shocked at the deaths of at least 12 civilians in Volnovakha earlier this month and by reports of hospitals being shelled in Donetsk. We have seen yet more reports of Russian personnel and equipment crossing the Ukrainian border. Among this, we have heard the usual pattern of Russian denials and misinformation. It is clear, just as it was when we last met, in November (see S/PV.7311), that Russia’s actions continue to undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, violating international norms and flouting the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. The humanitarian impact of these actions is also clear. Over 1 million people have been displaced from their homes. As winter deepens, the situation will only get worse, with the elderly, the young and the infirm all increasingly vulnerable. The separatists must allow Ukrainian humanitarian convoys to enter the regions they control, and Russia must stop using its unilateral humanitarian convoys as cover to supply those separatists with arms. The human rights situation gives equal cause for concern, with human rights violations reported in the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula and a total breakdown in law and order in areas under separatist control. Against this deteriorating context, it should dismay us all that repeated calls for a ceasefire and for respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity have not been heeded. All sides must engage in constructive dialogue and bring about an end to violence in eastern Ukraine. Russia must take steps to withdraw its equipment and troops from Ukraine, cease its support for the separatists and effectively control its borders. Despite persistent claims to the contrary, the evidence of Russia’s support is beyond denial. Two days ago, two companies of Russian troops, including up to 30 armoured personnel carriers and a dozen tanks, were seen crossing the border into Ukraine. Daily we see Russian soldiers operating alongside the separatists. We see separatists brandishing the PKP, Russia’s newest machine gun. We have also seen Russian- supplied T-72 BM tanks in the streets of Luhansk and Donetsk. Neither the PKP nor the T-72 BM is used by the Ukrainian armed forces. The consequences of the situation in the Donbas continue to hurt both the people and the economies of Ukraine and Russia. But there is a political way out: through implementation of the agreements that were reached in Minsk in September. However, despite a number of diplomatic initiatives, including today’s Normandy-format meeting, more than 1,000 people have been killed since those commitments were made in September, and separatists have taken control of a substantial additional area of Ukrainian territory since the September agreements. Indeed, any analysis of the implementation of the Minsk agreements lays bare the manifest failure of Russia and the separatists to implement 10 out of the 12 commitments made on that occasion. In particular, Russia’s refusal to implement two key provisions continue to undermine the prospects for peace in Ukraine. First, at Minsk, all sides agreed to secure continuous monitoring on the Ukraine/Russian border and verification by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) of the creation of a security zone in the border regions of Ukraine and Russia. Despite the best efforts of the OSCE, whose work has been exemplary despite the challenges presented, only two checkpoints are currently monitored on the Russian side, leaving hundreds of kilometres free for the flow of weapons and personnel into Ukraine. If it is serious about Minsk, Russia must stop blocking the expansion of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission. Secondly, at Minsk, all sides agreed “to remove illegal armed formations, military equipment, fighters and mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine”. Yet hundreds of Russian troops still remain on the territory of Ukraine, as do thousands of so-called volunteers, in flagrant violation of the protocol. The withdrawal of those forces is fundamental to the Minsk agreement and the only way to secure the future territorial integrity of Ukraine. It is important that the Council continue to pay the closest attention to the situation in Ukraine and insist on further progress towards the implementation of the Minsk agreements. Russia has chosen not to uphold its commitments and pursue this path to restoring stability. And Ukraine, sadly, is not the only case. Russia has made an agreement with a breakaway Georgian province of Abkhazia and is in the process of doing the same with another Georgian region, South Ossetia. This demonstrates a pattern of Russian interference in the domestic affairs of its neighbours and a blatant disregard for their sovereignty and territorial integrity. We call on Russia to exert its influence over separatists, cease the destabilizing activities and work in good faith to find a political solution. The Minsk agreements provide the framework for that solution. They must be implemented in full and without delay. ","I thank you, Mr. President, for convening today’s meeting on the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. We are grateful for Under- Secretary-General Feltman’s unflagging attention to this alarming situation and for the alarm he sounded in the Security Council today in very explicit terms. As this is the Council’s first meeting on Ukraine in 2015, it is our twenty-eighth meeting on the crisis in the past 11 months, far more than on any other situation during the same period. We keep meeting on Ukraine because, despite countless commitments made to the international community to de-escalate — here in the Council and in Geneva, Minsk, Berlin, Normandy and elsewhere — Russia continues to choose a path of escalation and obfuscation. In addition to occupying Crimea, Russia continues to train, equip and fight alongside separatists in eastern Ukraine. Indeed, Russia has so consistently broken its commitments and violated its obligations not to lop off part of another country that some in the Council may begin to accept Russia’s behaviour as an unfortunate but inevitable reality, a new normal that would be dangerous for Ukraine and dangerous for international peace and security, because complacency would reward aggression and threaten the basic rules on which our collective security rests. The current situation is dangerous. It is dangerous because Russia continues to train and equip separatists with heavy weapons and to fight by their side, in flagrant violation of the September Minsk agreement, Ukrainian sovereignty and international law. Even as we sit here today, the separatists trained, supplied and supported by Russia are launching a full-scale attack on the strategic city of Debaltseve, inside Ukrainian-controlled territory, in blatant violation of the 19 September Minsk ceasefire lines, in an attemp to gain control of a significant rail juncture. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reported yesterday that at least 30 Grad rockets had hit the city on 19 January, killing 3 civilians and wounding 12. The OSCE confirmed that those rockets had come from the direction of the separatist-controlled city of Horlivka. Yesterday, independent media reported that separatists had blown up a rail bridge connecting the port city of Mariupol to the rest of Ukraine. Thankfully, there were no casualties, but now the city must rely on northern access via Donetsk, effectively isolating it and leaving it vulnerable to separatist attacks. These moves appear calculated and strategic in nature. Since President Poroshenko announced the unilateral silence regime on 9 December, which brought about a brief respite from the violence, separatists and the Russians who backed them have carried out more than 1,000 attacks against Ukrainian positions. Since late December Russia has transferred at least 100 additional pieces of Russian military equipment and materiel to separatists. These latest transfers come atop previous transfers of hundreds of pieces of Russian military equipment to separatists since September, including tanks, armoured personnel carriers, heavy artillery pieces and other military vehicles. The OSCE is allowed to operate at only two checkpoints on the vast Ukrainian-Russian border. Yet from those two checkpoints alone, monitors note hundreds of individuals in military-style dress freely crossing the border every week. The separatists have a larger fighting force, with more weaponry than some European countries. Meanwhile, Russia is reportedly preparing to deliver its twelfth resupply convoy to separatists in Ukrainian territory at the end of the month. If the past 11 deliveries are any indication, Russia will deny international monitors or Ukrainian authorities the ability to fully inspect the convoys. If Russia is indeed sending humanitarian aid, what does it have to hide? The current situation is dangerous. It is dangerous because separatists continue to harass, threaten and intimidate the impartial monitors deployed by the OSCE, — monitors who serve on behalf of the international community. According to a 14 January OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine report, the SMM was stopped at a separatist checkpoint in Oktyabr by a hostile separatist commander who ordered the team’s car searched and said the monitors would be shot if a camera was found, even though cameras are a basic tool of documentation work. Separatist guards kept their guns pointed at the monitors during the exchange, the monitors said, even though the team posed no threat and, mercifully, had no camera. The current situation is dangerous. It is dangerous because Russia continues to break commitments it has made to the escalades. Ukraine and the international community have launched several serious efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict, including through the trilateral contact Group on Ukraine, the Minsk agreement, the Normandy group and other negotiating forums. We continue to believe that there can be no military solution and that political negotiations are key. Yet, time and again, Russia’s words promise peace while Russia’s actions make war. Time and again, President Putin has extended an olive branch in one hand while passing out Grad missiles and tanks with the other. The current situation is dangerous. It is dangerous because Russia’s actions are directly contributing to a humanitarian crisis. With each passing day, more civilians are killed and maimed. Many of us have seen the ghastly images of the 13 January attack on a passenger bus, which was struck while waiting at a Ukrainian security checkpoint at Volnovakha. Indelible images of the blood-soaked snow alongside the bus, of its blown-out windows and the gapping holes left in its seats and curtains, of the gory steps to the back entrance of the bus — these images are unforgettable. Thirteen civilians were killed in that attack and at least 16 more people were wounded. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission said in a 17 January report that it had “conducted a comprehensive inspection, focusing on five craters caused by explosions that had occurred during the incident. The investigation included comprehensive crater analysis of two specific blast craters, including the crater located 10 metres from the side of the passenger bus. In the SMM’s assessment, all craters examined were caused by rockets fired from a north-north-eastern direction.” The conclusion of the impartial OSCE monitoring mission is that the craters at the crime scene were caused by rockets fired from the north-north-east direction from the checkpoint. That area is controlled by Russian-backed separatists, and multiple open- source reports have shown separatists firing Grad rockets from the territory to the north-north-east of Volnovakha. The same day the bus was struck, the SMM reported hearing Grad rockets fired from several other separatist-controlled areas. At first, separatists bragged on social media about the strike on the Ukrainian security checkpoint. Vut the postings disappeared after it was reported that a busload of civilians had been hit. For every attack on civilians that makes headlines, there are dozens more, no less deadly, that go unreported. Since the conflict began, more than 10,000 people have been injured in the conflict. Nearly 5,000 people have been killed, approximately 800 of them since November when the Council last met to discuss the Ukraine crisis (see S/PV.7311). One of the attacks that did not make news occurred on 11 January. According to the SMM, mortars struck two houses in the Government- held town of Hranitne, wounding a girl. She died of her injuries before she reached the hospital — she was three years old. Those are some of the reasons why the Russians’ most recent efforts to blame Ukraine ring so hollow. On Thursday, President Putin issued a last-minute invitation to President Poroshenko to discuss a new Russian-conceived so-called peace plan — a plan that would free Russia from the commitment it made in Minsk to withdraw its fighters and return control over the international border to Ukraine. The plan would seek to legitimize territorial gains made by separatists since September, as well as Russian personnel and military equipment on the territory of Ukraine. We have seen peace plans like that before in Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria. When President Poroshenko did not accept Putin’s offer, Russia immediately launched a diplomatic and media blitz, claiming it was proof that Ukraine was not interested in peace. Let us pull the veil away from Putin’s peace plan and call it for what it is: a Russian occupation plan. We need to implement the peace plans we already have — peace plans Russia has signed and broken. If Russia is serious about peace, it should follow through on Minsk, to which it had agreed more than four months ago. If Russia wants to end the conflict, the steps they must take are the same as they were on 5 September 2014: remove all military equipment and personnel from Ukraine; stop backing the separatists; allow unimpeded OSCE monitoring; return control of Ukraine’s international border to the Ukrainian Government and release all hostages, including those being held in Russia, such as Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko. We understand Ms. Savchenko has been on hunger strike for nearly a month to protest her detention and is suffering serious health problems. Yet Russia has taken none of the steps set out in Minsk. In contrast to Russia, Ukraine has consistently taken steps to de-escalate the crisis, demonstrating measurable progress on several key commitments made in Minsk and passing key reforms to reduce corruption and grant greater authority to its regions. In September and December, President Mr. Poroshenko announced unilateral ceasefires on the part of Ukrainian forces, resulting in brief but significant decreases in violence. Yet peace cannot be made unilaterally. Where Ukraine has been forced to respond to cynical attempts by the separatists and Russian forces to use the ceasefires to gain additional territory, the Ukrainian forces have tried to hold the agreed line. Of course, the Ukrainian Government must abide by international norms, even as it defends its land and its people. We are concerned by the European Council’s report on abuse in Ukrainian prisons, and we urge the Government to conduct thorough, impartial investigations into its findings, as well as to develop a plan to address them. We take seriously reports of the alleged use of cluster munitions in populated areas. All sides should take every feasible precaution to prevent any loss of civilian life, including by indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas. There is a broader reason it would be dangerous to accept Russia’s actions as the new normal. We have seen this playbook before. Before eastern Ukraine we saw it in Crimea, and before Crimea we saw it in the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and before that in Georgia and Transnistria. The end-game in all of those Moscow-manufactured crises has been identical: to gobble up parts of neighbouring countries and to create frozen conflicts. And Russia is consistently working to put those frozen conflicts under a deeper freeze. In recent weeks, for example, at the same time that Russia was flouting its Minsk agreements, President Putin was putting the finishing touches on another set of agreements, the so-called “treaties of alliance”, with de facto authorities in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Those treaties will compound years of violations of Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. What is frozen in these conflicts? Instability is frozen. Violations of sovereignty are frozen. Militarization is frozen. In sum, all of the problems that the United Nations, and the Security Council in particular, were created to address, are frozen. If Russia succeeds in achieving its aims, if we allow this behaviour to become the new normal, this will not be the last time Russia uses this well-worn playbook. I certainly understand the desire of the representative of the Russian Federation to speak about other conflicts and other crises, rather than the situation and their tactics of continuing to support the separatists who are wreaking havoc in Ukraine. It seems that while Russia continues the same tactics of supporting the separatists in Ukraine, it also continues its same tactics in the Council — distracting and demonstrating a repeated preference for fantasy over fact. So let us be clear. It has been claimed that the Russian Federation is striving for implementation of the Minsk agreements. In fact, Russia and the separatists it supports have taken practically no steps to implement the September Minsk agreements. For example, attacks are continuing past the agreed ceasefire line. Weapons, heavy artillery and military personnel continue to flow across the border from Russia to the separatists. The border remains unsecured and hostages are still being held, including on Russian territory. Meanwhile, Ukraine has taken great strides to implement the provisions of the 5 September Minsk protocol, including twice declaring a unilateral ceasefire as separatists continued to fire. It has been claimed that Ukraine is building up its military presence and resorting to militarization. In fact, Ukraine is attempting to hold the ceasefire line agreed to on 19 September. The fact that the Russian-backed separatists have decided to ignore the line and try to take additional territory does not provide a basis to renegotiate that line. The line should not be renegotiated because the separatists have gained additional territory through repeated ceasefire violations since September. It has been claimed that the Donetsk airport, under the Minsk agreements, should be under the control of the Russian-backed separatists. In fact, according to the 19 September Minsk agreement, the line of contact should go straight through the Donetsk airport and the agreement stipulated that all forces would draw back at least 15 kilometers on both sides of the ceasefire line. The airport would have remained neutral territory had the Minsk agreements been properly implemented. The 19 September agreement laid out specific coordinates. There should be no confusion that cannot be resolved with a GPS. The representative of the Russian Federation claims that Ukraine will not respond to President Putin’s latest proposal. In fact, there is no need to renegotiate a new peace plan or a new ceasefire line. The September Minsk agreements, which provide for a cessation of fighting, permanent international monitoring of the border, the removal of all Russian equipment and personnel from the Ukrainian territory, the release of all hostages, and increased autonomy for the region within Ukrainian law, remain the best path to de-escalating the conflict. What the Russians seem to be doing is not to implement Minsk, but to redraft the line of control articulated in it. Russia and the separatists it supports should fulfil the commitments they made in September, rather than attempt to reopen negotiations while increasing the level of violence and attacks to change the facts on the ground. We need more facts, less fantasy. We need more implementation of Minsk, not more distractions from it. ",,,,,,,,,,,"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your effective leadership of the Council for the month of January. Since this is the first time my delegation has taken the floor this year, I would also like to congratulate the new members — Angola, Malaysia, New Zealand, Spain and Venezuela — on their election to the Council. I am grateful to you, Sir, for convening this meeting, and would also like to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing.
It has been almost a year since the events of February and March 2014, when the Russian Federation manipulated two of the basic principles of the United Nations — the right to self-determination and the right to protection — in order to create a fake legal pretext for invading Ukraine. As a result, it occupied and then annexed part of the sovereign territory of Ukraine, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol. Sooner or later the Russian Federation will be brought to justice for that particular crime of aggression against Ukraine.
As of today, the Russian Federation is continuing its military aggression in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine by sending military units into our territory, delivering heavy weapons to the local terrorist groups, training, equipping and financing mercenaries and waging an information war. That aggression is aimed at forcing my Government to change its constitutional and territorial order, thereby undermining the territorial integrity and political sovereignty of Ukraine.
Every day of the past year has been traumatic for the Ukrainian people. On 8 June, militants from the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic tortured and killed eight priests and parishioners of the Protestant church in the Ukrainian city of Slovyansk. On 17 July, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 was brought down from a zone controlled by the terrorists. Last week, on 13 January, terrorists fired on a passenger bus near the Ukrainian town of Volnovakha, killing 13 and wounding 15 Ukrainian civilians. The ongoing investigation of that tragic terrorist attack on civilians near Volnovakha, and the relevant conclusions of the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, prove that the shelling was carried out from the north-north-eastern areas currently occupied by illegal armed groups. I would like to take this opportunity to express Ukraine’s appreciation for the Council’s strong condemnation of that terrorist act. My country is waging a war against terrorism. It is fighting on the front lines for such universal values as freedom, sovereignty and democracy.
In the wake of the Minsk agreements of 5 and 19 September 2014, the President of Ukraine declared a ceasefire and began to implement all points, without exception, of the agreement signed by the representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the rebels. Despite the fact that they are signatories to the agreements, the Russian side and Russian-backed terrorists have persistently and brutally violated the Minsk provisions. With Russia’s backing, and in breach of the Minsk arrangements, the illegal armed groups have occupied more than 550 square kilometres since September. As a result of the terrorists’ lack of compliance with the ceasefire regime, during this period Ukraine has lost 237 military troops and at least 148 civilians. In contravention of the ceasefire regime, the shelling of Ukrainian positions has increased. In particular, in the past 10 days alone the total shelling has surpassed the numbers for the whole of the previous month.
Since signing the Minsk agreements in September, the Russian side has significantly increased its military presence in Donbas and has filled the region with highly sophisticated heavy weapons. The terrorists recently announced that they have created their own air force. We presume that is a manoeuvre to cover up the future deployment and use of Russian military aircraft in action. The build-up of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border has also increased and has now reached 50,000.
With your permission, Mr. President, I would like to say a few words in Russian.
(spoke in Russian)
What is a battalion of the 76th Airborne Division from Pskov doing in the residential areas of Heorhiivka and Komachova? What is a battalion doing in the residential areas of Pobeda and Hryhorivka?
(spoke in English)
A battalion is around 400 or 500 men.
(spoke in Russian)
What is a separate air-assault brigade from Ulyanovsk doing in the area of Starobeshevo? There is a battalion from the 76th Motorized Brigade from Maikop and the 49th Brigade from Stavropol. What are armed units from Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Kostroma, Shilovo, Yurga, Aleysk, Gusinoozyorsk, Pecheneg, Sputnik, Novorossiysk, Tula, Naro-Fominsk and elsewhere in Ukraine? These amount to more than 8,000 troops. Are they on vacation, as we have heard many times in clarification from the Russian side? Do their families know where they are?
(spoke in English)
Russia officially denies sending troops, but the Russian families of troops killed tell a different story. What is this if not aggression? We again draw the Council’s attention to the fact that the illegal armed groups intensified their attacks and shelling after receiving reinforcements from the territory of the Russian Federation, including in the form of Russia’s so-called humanitarian convoys. We denounce the provocative statements made by Russian officials, who have tried to shift responsibility for violations onto Ukraine, including those which the Russian delegation has made to the Security Council today. I do not have any intention of continually commenting on or of repeating the disinformation concerning the implementation of the Minsk agreements by my Government or the measures the Government of Ukraine has taken to meet the needs of the Ukrainian citizens in Donbas. Recently, we helped disseminate information on that issue to all members of the Security Council.
Even despite the intensification of foreign aggression, Ukraine remains fully committed to a peaceful settlement of the crisis, which should be based on the Minsk agreements and on full respect for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political unity of Ukraine. We have twice initiated a ceasefire and unilaterally adhered to it. On 13 November 2014, representatives of Ukraine and Russia signed a working document envisaging a clear schedule for the implementation of the provisions of the Minsk agreements, in particular concerning assurances of the bilateral ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons and return to the touch-line. The Russian side recalled its signature under that document.
On 18 January, Ukraine once again reiterated its appeal to the Russian Federation and suggested that Russia should sign the timetable for the implementation of the Minsk agreements, as worded on 13 November 2014, and to ensure that the ceasefire would start on 19 January. We believe that it will allow us to immediately resume the ceasefire and to protect civilians from the attacks carried out by the militants in the region in the course of the past four months. The beginning of the strict implementation of the document will create appropriate conditions for holding consultations of the trilateral contact group in the near future, and later the summit of Heads of State and Government to be held in Astana. We demand that the plan be finally implemented.
As was stated by the President of Ukraine, Mr. Petro Poroshenko, despite the escalation of pressure and the activation of terrorists, Ukraine is ready to sign the ceasefire agreement, given our full adherence to the Minsk agreements. Ukraine is striving for peace. We still expect the same commitment to the Minsk agreements on the part of the Russian side. After all, it is the President of the Russian Federation who has repeatedly confirmed his adherence to the implementation of the Minsk agreements in their full scope and without exception. That position was affirmed, inter alia, at the multilateral summit in Milan.
We sincerely thank all our partners for their solidarity with us at this crucial time for Ukraine, Europe, the Security Council and the world. We thank those who have expressed strong support today for the release of the Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savachenko, who is illegally detained in Russia. I apologise for taking the floor again, but my country has been mentioned several times in the past few minutes. I will make a few comments on the so-called national dialogue on decentralization in Ukraine and the humanitarian situation.
As my colleague said, yesterday morning we sent to all members of the Security Council — including the Russian Federation — information on the social and humanitarian situation in Donbas and the measures taken by the Government of Ukraine to meet the needs of the Ukrainian citizens in Donbas. Everything is contained in that paper, so I do not know why the Russian colleague has told the mistruth that we are not commenting on Ukraine’s policy of inclusiveness. It is up to those present to decide.
On mobilization, yes, we are in the process of reforming our army, which was fully destroyed in recent years. Why are we doing that? Because of the facts expressed today — the enlargement of the Russian military presence in in Donbas, Ukraine, with thousands of Russian nationals and sophisticated weaponry. We have a right to defend ourselves. That is why we are doing so, ourselves. Based on the United Nations principle of collective self-defence, we have called on many countries and organizations for assistance. It has not been easy to get a response; we have not received any weaponry equal to the Russians’. That is why we are doing what we are doing to defend ourselves. It is our right.
As to the issue of Ukrainian citizens, the paper I mentioned is addressed to the Ukrainian citizens in Donbas who are under the terrorist threat. Who are we calling terrorists? Those who killed the passengers of Flight MH-17, those who killed priests and those who killed civilians are terrorists and they would be considered terrorists anywhere, whatever their nationality or the threat they represent. We are participating in the common fight against terrorism. They are terrorists and they are called by that name because their actions identify them as terrorists.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I thank you, Mr. President, for organizing this debate. I also thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing.
Often in the corridors of this Organization, there is talk of being weary of the issue of Ukraine because of the many meetings that have been held on the subject, both in the Security Council and the General Assembly. I would like to state very clearly here that Spain will never tire of defending the unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine. That is why we feel that it is important that the Security Council continue to very closely follow developments in the situation.
We heard with great concern the briefing by Under-Secretary-General Feltman, who qualified the situation on the ground as alarming. That alarm is justified, as just yesterday the Permanent Council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) met and made the same observation about the situation on the ground.
Spain of course supports the OSCE activities and the efforts of the trilateral contact group aimed at bringing about an effective ceasefire and implementing the pending elements of the Minsk agreements. The Minsk protocol and memorandum continue to be the fundamental reference points; they should not be reinterpreted. All efforts aimed at a return to the path laid out by the Minsk agreements would be welcome. We therefore hope that the efforts undertaken in recent days in the Normandy format and within the trilateral contact group will continue to make progress.
As I said, we are extremely concerned by the escalation of the situation on the ground. We believe that it is essetnail that all signatories to the Minsk agreements reaffirm the ceasefire’s validity.
With regard to the civilian population, I would say that preventing their suffering is an indispensable and urgent task. We need to guarantee an effective distribution of humanitarian aid. The European Union has shown and will continue to demonstrate itself to be an asset in that regard. We have thus far provided €76 million in aid and are working to increase that amount. Of that, 40 per cent has been allocated to the inhabitants of the conflict areas controlled by the rebels. I would also like to say that there is a clear risk of humanitarian assistance being used for the wrong reasons, and we need to work together to establish a mechanism, perhaps within the trilateral contact group, which would seek to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to its rightful recipients.
Finally, we would stress that any lasting and sustainable solution must include respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. That is the crux of General Assembly resolution 68/262 and the essential message that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Spain, Mr. García Margallo, will convey to the Kyiv authorities when he travels to the region on 8 and 9 February. That will be one of his first trips since the start of Spain’s non-permanent membership in the Security Council.","The recent escalation of violence in Ukraine is a very serious threat to what were at best, even before that escalation, fragile steps towards a peace. The Under-Secretary-General’s report that there is a mounting alarm at the situation, particularly the humanitarian situation, is one with which we can only agree. New Zealand therefore continues to be deeply concerned about this conflict, and particularly its implications for core principles of the Charter of the United Nations, such as territorial integrity and the prohibition of the threat or the use of force. The conflict has so far led to an unacceptable loss of life, especially that of civilians. More than 1 million people have been displaced from their homes, and they now face a very harsh winter.
Examples of the impact of this tragedy on innocent citizens abound. The destruction within the past 24 hours of a major bridge into Luhansk, while no doubt a military objective, also impedes desperately needed humanitarian relief, and that is totally unacceptable. We urge therefore close cooperation among all relevant parties, including the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), to provide urgently needed humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations.
It is a particular concern that the conflict continues despite the clear and unequivocal commitments recorded in the Minsk protocol and memorandum. We call on all parties to fully implement their commitments under those agreements, including an immediate and full cessation of all hostilities, with a clear definition of the line of contact between the parties. We also call for the continued release of detainees. These conditions must come into effect immediately to allow the resumption of productive diplomatic discussions, especially the planned summit-level consultations. And those consultations are now of great urgency. It should be clear to all of us that this crisis cannot be resolved by the use of force. A sustainable political solution must be found.
We continue to read with alarm reports indicating the involvement of Russian troops and materiel in the conflict, and urge both Russia and the pro-Russian separatists to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We also call on Russia to use its influence, as its representative just told us it has done before, to ensure that pro-Russian separatists fully respect the ceasefire.
We welcome the mediating role of the OSCE, and we encourage it to continue its efforts to end the fighting. However, we also believe that this Security Council must live up to its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations. It has already been pointed out that in 2014, the Council met no fewer than 27 times to discuss the situation in Ukraine; but so far, we have seen very little impact from all of that high level attention.
And so it is that at this the 28th meeting New Zealand affirms that the Council is properly seized of the matter and calls for a more purposeful Council engagement with a real focus on supporting efforts to negotiate a resolution to the conflict. Only then will we see tangible outcomes for those most affected — the people of eastern Ukraine.","I thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting. My delegation extends its appreciation to Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for his in-depth briefing.
Malaysia shares the grave concern expressed by Under-Secretary-General Feltman and other Council members on the deteriorating situation on the ground in the east of Ukraine. As expressed by the Secretary-General on 18 January, the severe escalation in fighting, especially at the Donetsk airport, has threatened to unravel the September 2014 ceasefire. With a view to immediately de-escalating the situation, Malaysia calls on the conflicting parties to cease fighting and adhere to their commitments to implementing the Minsk protocol and memorandum in their entirety. A military solution would not be sustainable and would not benefit anyone.
The Ukraine crisis has claimed far too many casualties. Close to 5,000 people have been killed, while over 1 million have been displaced. Malaysia is deeply saddened by the recent tragic shelling of a bus transporting civilians on 13 January in the Donetsk region, which caused the death of 12 and injured many more, among them women and children. Malaysia calls for an independent investigation into the incident to hold the perpetrators accountable. That latest incident is yet another instance of senseless killing as the escalating conflict in eastern Ukraine claims more and more innocent victims.
After the downing of MH-17, which killed 298 civilians and shocked the world last summer, Malaysia hoped that the tragic incident would push the conflicting parties to de-escalate the situation, cease fighting and engage in a dialogue to reach a political solution to the conflict. Instead the conflict has been prolonged and grown more intense since then, claiming more and more casualties, and causing a humanitarian crisis.
It is our conviction that adherence to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations is of paramount importance in maintaining international peace and security. In particular, we affirm our commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as to the principle of non-interference in its internal affairs, as espoused in the Charter. In this regard, Malaysia condemns any threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, which has brought about the crisis, and views such threats as a violation of the United Nations Charter.
Malaysia calls for constructive engagement on all sides and urges the conflicting parties to continue to explore all possible avenues to find a peaceful solution. Malaysia supports every peaceful effort, including international diplomatic initiatives aimed at resolving the situation in Ukraine. We call on all parties to respect the rule of law, including international human rights law and international humanitarian law, to act responsibly and to aim towards finding a peaceful settlement. Malaysia stands ready to play a constructive role towards de-escalating the crisis and resuming talks to restore Ukraine’s stability and territorial integrity. We hope that both sides will adopt a moderate approach and find a mutually acceptable solution. The interest, welfare and security of the people of Ukraine must be given top priority by all parties.","We would like to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this informative meeting of the Security Council on Ukraine. We also welcome Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, and thank him for his briefing on the current situation in Ukraine.
The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela supports the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with international law. We advocate a political and diplomatic solution to the Ukrainian crisis to be brought about constructively in accordance with the norms and principles of international law.
We are firmly convinced of the need to put an end to the hostilities in south-eastern Ukraine as soon as possible. We reject the acts of violence and ethnic and political persecution and the acts of terrorism regardless of who commits them.
Direct negotiation is the most appropriate means for achieving that goal, and there should be no interference in matters under the domestic jurisdiction of States, be they military, political or economic.
Venezuela stresses that the mediation of regional organizations is the path to a negotiated settlement of the conflict. In that regard we support the efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Germany and France aimed at promoting dialogue among Ukraine, Russia and the representatives of the Donbas region. We hope that the recent political meetings will help to bring about a ceasefire that will lead to lasting peace in strict compliance with the Minsk agreements.
Venezuela believes that the parties should act with moderation in order to avoid the dialogue being affected by unilateral actions that could jeopardize the peace process. In that regard, our country rejects the application of unilateral coercive sanctions, which are contrary to international law and counterproductive to the desire for peace and stability in the region, as they erode the necessary climate of trust between the parties. We also believe that any incident on the ground should be investigated in an independent manner, with evidence being provided that supports its conclusions.
We must avoid a military escalation and the spread of the conflict. All efforts should be made to address the historical and root causes of the crisis in order to achieve a strong and lasting peace that includes all parties involved.
We call upon the parties to strictly observe the commitments concerning the protection of civilians in the areas affected by violence, including the need to ensure access to humanitarian assistance for internally displaced persons, refugees and others living in the areas affected by the conflict.
Finally, we call on all parties to redouble their efforts in the search for a just and lasting political solution, which is in everyone’s interest and in the interest of the entire region.","We welcome the convening of this meeting this afternoon, and thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for the very in-depth briefing that he provided to the Council.
The crisis in Ukraine has serious consequences for the political, economic and social stability of its people, and we agree that all peaceful means must be found to resolve it. The Minsk agreement signed in September is an important basis for a settlement as long as all the parties concerned can demonstrate the political will to make it a reality, in spirit as well as in letter. We know that a round of negotiations was scheduled for this afternoon in Berlin between the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany. It is our conviction that it will be possible to reach a negotiated solution if the parties have the political will. That would certainly be a welcome development for the Council at the beginning of a new year and with the restart of our deliberations on this crisis.
The humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine is deplorable, and it is unacceptable that so many people continue to be killed, maimed and deprived of food, clean water, housing and other essentials of human life, especially given the extremely cold winter they are living through.
Finally, Angola appeals to all the parties directly or indirectly involved in the conflict to use their intelligence to find possible solutions to safeguarding international peace and security in this conflict. ","I thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing, and I thank you, Mr. President, for convening this open meeting in view of the recent deterioration of the situation in eastern Ukraine and continuous violations of the Minsk agreements. Both Russia and the Russian-sponsored illegal militants persist in interpreting the ceasefire in their own twisted way: Ukraine must cease while the militants can continue to fire.
I believe that no one in this Chamber has any doubt that a country under attack would do its utmost to protect itself. In the face of aggression, it is the inherent right of each and every State to defend its land and its people. That is exactly what Ukraine is doing — defending itself in the face of the ongoing attacks against its unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Time and again in recent months, its leadership has sought to salvage the ceasefire with new proposals, new deadlines and new periods of silence. The militants, however, have benefited from Ukraine’s restraint by regrouping, rearming and grabbing more land. Since the start of the ceasefire, the militants have captured an extra 550 square kilometres of Ukrainian territory between Donetsk and Mariupol and, according to their commanders, have no intention of stopping.
In spite of the many calls of the international community to close its borders to the illegal flows of arms and foreign fighters, Russia’s borders remain wide open to the flow of deadly weaponry and soldiers of fortune. Here is a typical excerpt from the 16 January report of the smm of the Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE):
“The SMM saw three unmarked trucks towing three D-30 122-mm howitzers on the southern edge of Donetsk city, travelling west past a ‘DPR’-controlled checkpoint. Two unmarked T-80 battle tanks were seen by the SMM travelling south-east in Makiivka ... The SMM observed a convoy of 21 military-style Ural and KAMAZ trucks, also unmarked, heading south on a highway near Starobesheve ... Four of the trucks carried what appeared to be communication equipment, while the remaining trucks were covered.”
Here is another report. In the weekly update for the period of 15-21 January, the OSCE observer mission at Gukovo and Donetsk noted:
“The OM continued to observe a number of persons in military-style clothing crossing the border in both directions... During the reporting period, the Obersvation Teams observed 396 men and women in military-style dress crossing the border in both directions... Ninety-three percent of border crossings occurred at the Donetsk BCP.”
The little that can be gleaned from the two kilometres where the OSCE observer mission is active is clearly indicative of what is happening away from the eyes of the observers. It is no wonder that Russia keeps blocking all attempts to expand the OSCE border observer mission to cover more ground. The Ukrainian sources estimate that as of 15 January, the separatists had 542 tanks, 990 armoured personnel carriers, nearly 700 artillery systems, some 70 Grad rockets and 57 air defence systems.
How on Earth, but for Russia’s continued supply, could a ragtag bunch of illegal militants obtain such an impressive arsenal of sophisticated heavy weaponry and arms, which by now could well rival the arsenals of the smaller European States? And where on Earth, but for Russia’s continued support, could a ragtag bunch of militants get the millions needed to buy all that heavy weaponry and machinery, especially in an area where the local inhabitants are said to be starving and local hospitals cannot even buy bread for their patients? So much for Russia’s claims that it is not a party to this conflict. The war in eastern Ukraine is not a civil war, as some try to portray it, but a calculated and systematic attempt to destabilize Ukraine — a foreign-sponsored war.
Backed by sophisticated weaponry including Grad rockets, artillery systems, modern tanks, armoured personnel carriers, and an influx of foreign mercenaries, the militants continue their barrage of deadly attacks. The past few weeks in particular have seen a disturbing increase in ceasefire violations, including a massive onslaught by the militants on the Donetsk airport. Yesterday again, intensive fighting was reported in several locations, including north-west of Luhansk, where militants destroyed, with massive artillery fire, and occupied one of the checkpoints of the Ukrainian military.
Growing evidence points to a systematic use by the militants of residential areas as a cover for launching Grad rockets and shelling the Ukrainian forces. Overall, since the announcement of the ceasefire on 5 September 2014, Ukrainian forces and civilians have been shelled more than 5,660 times, some 1,500 Ukrainian military have been killed and wounded, and at least 151 civilians have been killed. We look forward to the results of a thorough investigation of the Volnovakha bus attack. We must ensure that perpetrators of this reprehensible act, and all the countless acts of violence and gross violations of human rights, especially around the areas held by the illegal separatist groups, are brought to account.
While every defensive move by Ukraine is blasted by the Russian propaganda as ceasefire violations, Russia has never even once condemned or disowned the illegal and lawless separatist militants. On the contrary. Russia’s intentions to rewrite the Minsk agreements in a way that would legitimize and accept the territorial gains achieved by the militants speaks to the Kremlin’s wholehearted support for those criminals. Lithuania rejects all calls to renegotiate the terms of the ceasefire. The agreed parameters of the ceasefire already exist and must be respected. We urge all sides, in particular Russia, to engage and fully implement the Minsk agreements in their entirety and without any further delay.
If Russia is genuinely interested in putting an end to the devastating violence and deaths in eastern Ukraine, including the deaths of its own nameless soldiers sent to wage a war against a brotherly nation, it must stop destabilizing Ukraine, stop military supplies to its proxies, stop the illegal separatist groups and withdraw all military equipment. The Ukrainian- Russian State border must be secured. Continuous monitoring by the OSCE must be ensured. All hostages and illegally detained persons must be released, including the Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko, who was kidnapped and is being held illegally in Russia.
International observers, including the United Nations and OSCE monitoring missions, must be allowed full and unconditional access throughout Ukraine’s territory, including Crimea. International monitors’ full, unobstructed access to Crimea remains particularly important in the light of the continuous deterioration of the situation of the indigenous Tatar community since the annexation by Russia of the region.
My delegation firmly supports Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and will not recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea. We urge the Minsk signatories to spare no effort in seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis. We urge Russia in particular to embrace the fundamental principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and put an end to its destabilizing, expansionist and revanchist policies in the region, including Ukraine, Moldova and the South Caucasus, where, contrary, to Russia’s commitments under the 2008 August and September agreements, it is pursuing the annexation of Georgia’s Abkhaz and Tskhinvali regions under the guise of the so-called treaties on alliance and strategic partnerships. ","I thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing. Nigeria is deeply concerned that despite the various efforts aimed at resolving the crisis in Ukraine, the situation on the ground has not changed. The fighting between Government forces and separatist rebels continues unabated and has indeed intensified.
In our pronouncements on the crisis in Ukraine, we have consistently called for a political solution that adequately addresses the concerns of the separatists while preserving and fully respecting the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine. That remains our position. We urge the parties to work in good faith towards overcoming the current stalemate in the implementation of the Minsk agreement, which Nigeria sees as providing a credible and workable framework for a peaceful resolution of the crisis.","I should like to extend our thanks to the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, for his comprehensive briefing.
Jordan expresses its concern vis-à-vis the accelerating deterioration of the situation in Ukraine. The crisis has reached dangerous proportions, and the Security Council and the international community must therefore work harder than ever before to resolve the crisis. More than 4,700 people have died so far and more than 1 million have been displaced to other regions within Ukraine and neighbouring countries as a result of the conflict in the east and the deterioration of the humanitarian situation there, especially in basic economic and health services. This is in addition to the flagrant and systemic violations of human rights being committed. We do not need to reiterate them at every meeting, but to affirm that they must come to an end.
That is why we call on all parties to show self-restraint and to immediately stop using force so as to salvage the peace process through a return to peaceful negotiations in order to avert any further escalation, which would only lead to more violence among the parties to the conflict.
We reiterate that there is a need to stop the escalating use of provocative language among the parties so as to give reason and dialogue a chance. Jordan reiterates its belief that it is important to respect the borders of Ukraine as well as its sovereignty and territorial integrity, not to interfere in its internal affairs, to restore security and calm to the border areas, and to stem the flow of foreign fighters and weapons to the separatists.
Instability in Ukraine will be bad not only for Ukraine but also for all the countries of the region and beyond, and the negative political and economic impact will affect the whole region. That is why we feel that we must take practical steps to comprehensively implement the Minsk accord for peace both in letter and in spirit. That is the political framework that was agreed by all parties with a view to achieving a comprehensive peace.
We also call on the Ukrainian Government to continue with its reform programmes, especially in the public and justice sectors, and to see that justice is done by holding accountable those who have committed crimes, including those who have used explosive weapons, and bringing them to justice, as well as completing e the trials that were begun for some of them.
We affirm the need to take every possible measure to protect civilians, provide basic services for citizens and implement the human rights strategy that was charted out for the next five years.
Finally, Jordan values and supports all efforts to bring about peace and to restore stability and security to Ukraine, including the efforts made by European leaders and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and its observers, as well as the efforts of Kazakhstan to host a Quartet summit at the end of this month. Jordan looks forward to that summit and to the urgent meeting of the Minsk Contact Group. We hope that the two meetings will lead to a positive outcome and that a solution will be reached that is satisfactory to all parties.
We also call on the parties to show a genuine commitment to use this opportunity to work to pacify the situation in Ukraine and to bring about lasting peace.","I will now make a statement in my capacity as representative of Chile.
We thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, for his briefing.
I would first like to say how deeply concerned we are about the new escalation of the crisis in eastern and southern Ukraine, particularly around the Donetsk airport. We deplore the worsening security situation, which has had serious consequences for the civilian population, who continue to suffer violations and abuses of human rights inflicted by all sides.
We urge the parties to comply fully with the ceasefire, as monitored and verified by the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, pursuant to the provisions of the Minsk accords. We are confident in the full ability of all the parties to implement the agreement, which is an inclusive political instrument designed to achieve peace and tranquillity for the entire population of eastern Ukraine. We urge all the parties to pursue the high-level dialogue in order to find a peaceful solution to the conflict and to exercise restraint and refrain from unilateral actions that could exacerbate tensions. We hope that the Minsk contact group can deliver positive results in the coming weeks.
Until a permanent peaceful solution is found, humanitarian assistance should be provided without delay and in accordance with humanitarian principles. The efforts of the international community must be channeled through the host Government, which has primary responsibility for aiding and protecting its people.
We emphasize the continued importance of strengthening the rule of law and the obligation to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, General Assembly resolution 68/262 and international law, as well as respecting the principle of non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of another State.
Lastly, we reiterate our support for the Secretary-General’s continued efforts to end the situation that Ukraine is enduring, and we hope that the various independent international mechanisms will continue to contribute to resolving this crisis.
I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.
I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine.","At the outset, I would like to thank the Chilean presidency for its initiative to hold this debate. I would also like to thank Mr. Feltman, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, for his briefing.
Chad is concerned by the deteriorating security situation in Ukraine, in particular in the areas around Donetsk and Luhansk, in the east of the country, where, following a period of relative calm, tensions have been on the rise since the beginning of 2015. Exchanges of fire and violent confrontations broke out around the airport of Donetsk on 29 December 2014, resulting in a number of victims, including Ukraine soldiers and separatists. That constitutes a serious violation of the ceasefire under the Minsk agreements of 5 and 19 September 2014.
We deplore this return to violence, including the firing of rockets on 13 January at a bus near Volnovakha in eastern Ukraine, resulting in the death of at least 12 civilians, most of them women. To that, we must add the violent clashes of the past 48 hours, which have caused several deaths among Ukrainian troops and civilians. Chad firmly condemns the return to violence. We call upon the parties to respect international humanitarian law, in particular with regard to the protection of civilians in armed conflict.
Chad takes note of the adoption by the Ukrainian Parliament, on 20 January, of a law for the partial mobilization of approximately 50,000 reservists to the army in 2015. However, we remain convinced that the solution to the Ukrainian crisis will be political and that it largely depends on the willingness of Ukrainians themselves to undertake a genuine negotiating process to arrive at a lasting peace. In that respect, Chad calls upon the parties to show calm and restraint and urges the Government to establish a direct and inclusive national dialogue in order to bring about national reconciliation.
Ukraine’s civil war sadly took a very high toll in 2014 in terms of lives lost. More than 4,800 were killed, to which we must add the 298 victims of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine in July. There have been 10,300 injured, including 300 children, and more than 1 million displaced.
In the light of this human tragedy, Chad encourages the international community to increase and diversify its mediation efforts aimed at relaunching the peace process in Ukraine. We would also call upon countries that wield influence with the parties to exert the necessary pressure in the pursuit of peace in Ukraine with full respect for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and unity of Ukraine in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.

S/PV.7311,12/11/2014,Political developments in Ukraine (incl. elections in the Donbas regions) as well as the state of the conflict in Donbas,"I thank Assistant Secretary-General ad interim Toynberg- Frandzen, Ambassador Apakan and Ambassador Tagliavini for their briefings just now. While the overall security situation in eastern Ukraine has been stable recently, violent attacks have continued to take place and have caused loss of life and property. China is concerned about that. At the same time, China welcomes the recent agreement signed between Russia and Ukraine on natural gas and hopes that the agreement will contribute to easing the current tensions and enhancing a political solution to the crisis in Ukraine. China believes that a political solution is the only way to resolve the question of Ukraine. For the next stage, all the parties concerned should truly implement the Minsk agreement in a comprehensive manner so as to ensure that a ceasefire is achieved, the violence in eastern Ukraine is brought to an end and the humanitarian situation in affected areas is alleviated. The question of Ukraine involves both complex history and current reality. A fundamental solution to the question of Ukraine should take into full account the legitimate rights, interests and wishes of all regions and ethnic groups in Ukraine. It should also seek to satisfy the reasonable concerns of all parties and achieve a balance of interests among them. We hope that all parties will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with a view to agreeing on a balanced, lasting and comprehensive political solution. All parties should work together to achieve that goal. China has always abided by the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, including Ukraine. China supports all actions that will contribute to dialogue and consultation and to finding a political solution to the crisis. China will continue to play a positive and constructive role in favour of a political solution to the question of Ukraine. ","I thank Mr. Jens Anders Toyberg-Frandzen for his briefing, and Ms. Tagliavini and Mr. Apakan for theirs. Almost a year ago, Ukraine entered into a period of unprecedented transformation after years of administrative inefficiencies and political blockage. This transformation came from deep within Ukrainian society. Following the presidential election in May, the Ukrainian parliamentary elections of October 26 represent a new phase in the process of democratization taking place in Ukraine. The elections neatly confirm the fundamental choices of the Ukrainian people in favour of a deep transformation and a deep economic and social modernization of Ukraine. The forward march of Ukraine to the rule of law and political pluralism can continue. The path will be long. Agreed steps must now be translated into the implementation of necessary reforms in the areas of the economy, rule of law, decentralization and reconstruction. However, since Ukraine has embarked on the path of reform, it has been constrained in moving forward. The separatist agitation helped from outside the country has spread to the eastern part of Ukraine, first in Crimea — annexed in violation of the law — and then in the Donbas region, causing disturbances, human rights violations and a serious humanitarian situation. We condemn in the strongest terms this interference in Ukrainian internal affairs, which has taken place with flagrant disregard for its sovereignty and territorial integrity. As occurred in Crimea in March, so-called elections were held on 2 November by the separatists in the part of Donbas that they occupy. These elections violate the letter and the spirit of the Minsk protocol, which provides for local elections in accordance with Ukrainian law. It is essential to quickly reach full compliance with the ceasefire and pursue further negotiations on the provisional status of the regions of the east. With the signing of the ceasefire in Minsk on 5 September and an agreement on 19 September, a diplomatic process was finally set in motion between Kyiv and Moscow. These agreements remain a good basis for bringing about an end to the crisis based on three principles: respect for the ceasefire, monitoring of the eastern border of Ukraine, and political discussions for the purposes of finding a lasting solution. The priority now must be to remain on the path of dialogue and to continue the implementation of the agreements. Our goal is to bring Ukrainians, separatists and Russians to the negotiating table in order to stop the escalation. That is a crucial aspect of the Minsk protocol. Military movements last weekend at the Russian- Ukrainian border, confirmed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), are cause for great alarm in that respect. Several dozens of military vehicles including tanks entered Ukraine in recent days. The strengthening of the military presence of the separatists and the proliferation of troop movements have raised fears of renewed fighting on a larger scale. The announcement of the creation of a Donbas army and a general mobilization is particularly worrying. The separatists and their supporters must prove they are ready for dialogue and the search for peace. In this context, we call once again for Russia to prevent the transfer of arms and men across its border and to use all its influence on the separatists so that the ceasefire is fully respected. The issue of monitoring the Russian-Ukrainian border remains a focal point for reaching a political solution to the crisis. We expressed our readiness to provide the OSCE with our surveillance capabilities. The utility of drones has been shown in that they can be alternative and exclusive sources of information. We are in discussions with our Russian and Ukrainian partners on the subject. These discussions are difficult, but they are crucial if there is to be progress. We also believe that the mandate of the OSCE mission in Russian territory should be strengthened and expanded as quickly as possible to other border posts. In this context, our political approach is based on firmness and dialogue. The sanctions are not intended to punish but to encourage dialogue. Sanctions are a tool, but they are not the only one. The conclusion of the negotiations on the supply of natural gas 10 days ago is a sign that some progress can be achieved through dialogue. Europe gave a clear alternative — heavier sanctions if the destabilizing actions continued and worsened, or a re-examination of the question if the situation on the ground bears witness to a real implementation of the agreements of 5 September. It is high time that we all rally in favour of de-escalation and the re-establishment of good-neighbourly relations between independent and sovereign States. No one has interest to fan the flames and return to the rhetoric of another century. ","At the outset, I would call on my colleagues on the Security Council not to turn the Council’s meetings into farces of rabid hysterics. We carefully listened to the briefing of the Assistant Secretary-General ad interim for PoliticalAffairs, Mr. Toynberg-Frandzen and thank him for the information provided. We also thank the Chief Monitor of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Mr. Apakan, and the representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office of the OSCE, Ms. Tagliavini. We were interested to hear the evaluations of those who are directly working on the ground every day to resolve the situation in south-eastern the Ukraine. At the same time, we believe that inviting international players acting under an OSCE mandate to Security Council meetings is not totally appropriate, not to mention that it distracts them from their direct obligations and unnecessarily politicizes practical activities. The fact that inviting them was for precisely that purpose has been confirmed by the statements we have heard today by several Council members, who have used our platform and the OSCE representatives not to constructively seek a solution to an internal Ukrainian crisis, but rather to make another foray into propaganda, with new flourishes. The situation in the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces unquestionably remains tense. The ceasefire regime is not being fully complied with, and the withdrawal of heavy weaponry and equipment has not begun. On the contrary, during the entire period of the ceasefire we have seen Ukrainian forces concentrated along almost all the front lines. It is important to note that that concentration of the Ukrainian forces is taking place very close to the cities of Donbas, which the rebels are forced to protect. As a result, there have been clashes between the parties along the front lines. Innocent civilians are being killed every day, especially in territory controlled by the Ukrainian armed forces in the residential areas of Avdeyevka and Peski. There is systematic shelling in residential areas of Donetsk near the airport. On 6 November, a mortar shell launched from that neighbourhood in a north-westerly direction — which has been confirmed by the OSCE monitors — fell on a Donetsk sports school soccer field, killing two boys and injuring three. Cluster munitions fired from the same position at the beginning of October killed some workers from the International Committee of the Red Cross. In the Russian language the word “truth” exists only in the singular. It has no plural, unlike the word “lie”, and in the context of that silenced truth, it would seem logical that the strengthened rebel positions the OSCE monitors have seen are in areas that are under constant attack by the armed forces. Apparently Kyiv’s fear of the rebel forces is so great that in order to justify their failures and the massive deployment of people and equipment to the front, we are once again hearing loud assertions about Russia sending weapons and members of its regular army. In the Western capitals and through NATO they are shouting pronouncements about virtual deployment of convoys and fighters from Russian territory. But no one is presenting any real facts to confirm such assertions, because this is all empty talk and the usual propagandistic lies. It should be clear that in the current conditions, the Russia-Ukraine border is subject to particularly careful attention and observation and is easy to monitor, including from space. We are unfortunately compelled to admit that we are discouraged by the almost complete lack of reaction from the OSCE Mission concerning the movements and strengthening of positions of the Ukrainian armed forces and its other armed sub-divisions, which, by the way, have their own “Daddies”, as one of our colleagues expressed it here in the Chamber. We do not know to whom or how they are accountable. But on 9 November heavy artillery and tanks entered Karlivka; on 8 November Grad and Uragan multiple-launch rocket systems and Scud missile launchers arrived in the Luhansk area, and a group of 500 Ukrainian military entered the Krasna Talivka district in the Luhansk region. On 7 November, 32 tanks approached the eastern outskirts of Horlivka, while 13 tanks, 15 Shilka self- guided anti-aircraft guns, 7 Tochka-U tactical missile launch systems, 6 Grad multiple launch rocket systems and a Smerch multiple rocket launcher headed for Artemivsk. On 6 November a tank convoy entered the outskirts of Yasynuvata in Donetsk province. Those are statistics. Why are these facts not being talked about? It must be clear to everyone that the lack of information on this in the OSCE report creates a false and provocative picture of what has happened. We hope that gap will be filled. We believe that the full, thorough compliance of the parties to the conflict with the Minsk agreement is essential. In that regard, he first major issue is establishing a genuine ceasefire that both sides would observe responsibly. No less important, however, are the elements of the agreements concerning the decentralization of authority and establishing an inclusive nationwide dialogue and measures for improving the humanitarian and economic situation in Donbas. But the Ukrainian authorities are doing none of those things. We are concerned about President Poroshenko’s decision to recall the law on a special status for specific areas of Luhansk and Donetsk provinces. After all, that is a cornerstone of the Minsk agreements, which will essentially be made completely null and void. The law was not ideal and had limited legitimacy; the previous convocation of the Verkhovna Rada did not indicate the boundaries of the districts that would have special status, and the date of 7 December for elections cited in the law was notdiscussed with representatives from Donetsk and Luhansk and violated Ukraine’s own Constitution. Despite that, the law could have become a basis for further talks between Kyiv and the rebels. Kyiv also failed to implement another important provision of the Minsk agreement, the law granting amnesty to those who have participated in the events. Moreover, it appears that the Chair of the Verkhovna Rada is proposing that it be rescinded. No guarantees of personal security for participants in the consultations were provided. Turning now to the humanitarian aspects of the agreements, we find that instead of taking measures to rebuild Donbas, the Ukrainian Government has established a new order for financing its budgetary institutions and meeting social and pension payments — they have simply been cancelled. How can there be any talk of trust from ordinary people’s point of view when their homes being bombed and they themselves lack the wherewithal to live? In that regard, we reject any accusations directed at Russia’s efforts to send humanitarian convoys carrying food, medicines and building materials to Donetsk and Luhansk. In the worsening circumstances, such accusations are simply amoral. And we have had enough of the fabrications and distortions on this subject. Kyiv is informed about every humanitarian convoy fully and in good time, but getting its cooperation is problematic. We get the feeling that it is not very concern about the fate of its own people in those regions. Regarding the elections held in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions on 2 November, over which a number of delegations have expressed exaggerated horror, as if the process was not a democratic one, I would like to emphasize the following points. The Russian Federation respects the will of the people of the south-east as they have expressed it. On the whole, the elections were conducted in an orderly way and oter turn-out was high, and certainly not forced at gunpoint. It is particularly important that the elected representatives received a mandate to resolve the practical issues of restoring normal life in the region. They pose no threats to the Minsk agreements and the peace process. Moreover, they present a unique opportunity for launching a sustainable dialogue between the central Ukrainian authorities and the representatives of Donbas, with the goal of finding comprehensive political solutions that can eliminate the accumulated disagreements. We have been talking since the spring about the fact that there is no alternative to an inclusive dialogue conducted on a mutually respectful and equal basis. It is high time for Kyiv to fulfil the obligations it undertook in Geneva, particularly given that it now has representative partners in the negotiations. I do not want to engage in polemics with the Permanent Representative of Ukraine, but all the same I wish to call attention to a few things. First, I have said, and I repeat, that of course the ceasefire and the normalization of the situation are the key tasks, but they require trust. When we heard the statements of Ukraine’s representatives in late October, early November and more recently, we were convinced that Kyiv was not committed to a diplomatic solution to the conflict. From the very beginning, the Kyiv authorities have made no secret of the fact that the ceasefire would be used for a realignment of forces and the pursuit of military activities. In the framework of what I have said, there is only one truth. I would like to cite two statements, the first made by Yuri Lytsenko, an adviser to the President of Ukraine, on 24 October, before the elections, on the Ukrainian radio. He said: “The ceasefire and the achievement of peace are going to work in our favour. All four tank factories are working three shifts. Several hundred armed vehicles have been fully rebuilt and have entered the anti-terrorist operation area. We need the ceasefire regime to receive high-tech equipment and military and financing assistance from the West.” Markiyan Lubkivsky, an adviser to the head of the Security Service of Ukraine, also said on the national radio, on 2 November and again on 7 November: “Sooner or later, we are going to have to engage in very proactive activities” and that “we will need three or four years to resolve the situation. We think we could win this war based on the Croatian scenario. In 1991, Croatia began the war and it ended in 1995 as a result of successful special operations.” As we can see, there is not a single word about the implementation of the Minsk agreement here, just about a victory on the battlefield. Secondly, of course some activities do not help the situation from the Ukrainian perspective. For example, with respect to the serious matter of the delimitation of territory, an agreement had been almost 80 per cent concluded. Then suddenly on 28 October, the Ukrainian representative General Dumansky, without offering any reasons, annulled an accord in which over 80 per cent of the lines of opposing forces had been delimited. Lastly, as I understand it, the Ukrainian representative asked me here and now to an answer the question why several hundred units and vast amounts of Russian military equipment are being concentrated on the Ukrainian border. First, I cannot answer because I do not know if that is true or what sources of information are being cited. Those are horrific numbers; they are very striking, even to me. I am ready to respond to that question in a more specific manner. It will be agreed that the equipment and the Russian armed forces are on the territory of my country and are not threatening Ukraine. They are not leaving my country. Thus, inciting such emotions in the Security Council, as if there were going to be such huge attack on Ukraine, does not help the constructive discussions that all here are counselling and that we too endorse. ","I thank the three briefers for their briefings this afternoon. As others have pointed out, the Council has met many times on Ukraine over the past six months. There is a reason for that. The situation in Ukraine continues to be a severe threat and indeed an escalating threat to international peace and security. There is a reason why that is so. Since the start of the crisis, Russian actions have been consistently designed to undermine, interfere with and transgress Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in a way that flouts international norms, including the Charter of the United Nations. Since the Council last met on 24 October to discuss Ukraine (see S/PV.7287), Russia and the separatists it supports have repeatedly undermined and ignored the Minsk agreements. Russian leaders have told us one thing and then ordered their military, their special forces and their separatist rebel proxies to do another. The ceasefire has been breached. Attempts to monitor and verify the ceasefire and the border have been blocked. Russia continues to supply its soldiers in Ukraine and the separatists they fight alongside with heavy weaponry, artillery, tanks and armoured vehicles in flagrant breach of the Minsk protocols. Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reporting in recent days lays bare the extent of that Russian support. On several separate occasions, the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission has witnessed significant numbers of troops and military equipment moving in convoy in separatist-held areas. I will mention just one such report. On 8 November, the Mission observed a convoy of more than 40 unmarked military vehicles moving west on the outskirts of Donetsk. It included 19 unmarked Kamaz trucks, each towing a howitzer artillery piece and carrying personnel in green uniforms without insignia; 15 Kraz troop carriers; 6 fuel tankers; and an unmarked Bronetransporter armoured personnel carrier. We have seen this pattern before — unmarked columns of military vehicles entering Ukraine to support continued fighting by separatists. Efforts to remove markings and insignia from those vehicles cannot disguise the fact that they come from Russia. What other credible explanation is there? Yet Russia continues to deny that fact, despite the fact that its attempts at deception turned to farce only yesterday when Russian television station NTV broadcast footage of an armoured personnel carrier at the head of a column in Donetsk bearing markings from the Russian city of Ryazan. If Russia is not supplying separatists across the border, then why does it continue to block any expansion of OSCE border monitoring? Russia must implement the commitment it made at Minsk to allow the monitoring of its border with Ukraine, of which only 2 kilometres are currently observed by the OSCE. Flights of OSCE unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) above Donetsk must also be allowed to proceed unhindered. OSCE reports that UAVs are being jammed electronically by military- grade equipment call into question the credibility of the commitment towards the Minsk agreements of those who control that territory and their Russian supporters. The United Kingdom deeply regrets that illegal elections took place in separatist-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk on 2 November. The Secretary- General could not have been clearer in his public message that the elections were illegal under Ukrainian law and seriously undermined the Minsk protocol. The Chairperson-in-Office of the OSCE was equally clear that the elections ran counter to the letter and spirit of the Minsk protocol and would further complicate its implementation. When the leadership of international organizations to which Russia belongs issue such statements, one would expect Russia to listen. Instead, Russia has offered support to the elections. Russia has said that it will respect the will of the citizens of the Donbas despite the fact that, as President Poroshenko has made clear, the so-called elections were “a farce at gunpoint that had nothing in common with the real expression of the people’s will”. Russia’s refusal to disavow the elections is a continuation of a pattern of Russian behaviour that flouts the Minsk agreements and is designed to destabilize the situation in Ukraine. Although the focus of today’s discussion is the increase in fighting and the illegal elections held in eastern Ukraine, the Council must not lose sight of the deteriorating human rights situation in areas under separatist control in eastern Ukraine and in particular in the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula, which the mission of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is still unable to visit. We continue to receive disturbing reports of intimidation and harassment of Crimean Tatars, ethnic Ukrainians and all those who have refused Russian citizenship. The de facto Crimean authorities have undertaken a campaign to rid the Crimean peninsula of its Ukrainian and Tatar identity. Citizenship provisions, the educational syllabus and the media are all being ruthlessly engineered to that end. Crimean Tatars are being targeted by security forces; 18 prominent Tatars remain missing and 1 body has been found. That is an issue that we will need to come back to discuss when the mission of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights produces its next report. We have said in the past that Russia must be judged by actions, not words. What we see is that Russia’s actions continue to escalate tensions rather than contribute to a peaceful resolution of the crisis. The Minsk agreements offer a framework that can move the situation away from the current crisis and towards stability based upon de-escalation and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. However, that requires genuine commitment of a kind we have not yet seen from Russia. Instead, Russia is taking a cynical and selective approach towards the agreements while it continues its destabilization of Ukraine. That must change. We therefore call again on Russia to withdraw its equipment, weapons and troops from Ukrainian territory, as it undertook to do in September, and to use its influence to secure a lasting ceasefire. Its continued support for the armed separatists serves only to escalate an already perilous situation and will only lead to a further deterioration in Russia’s relations with the international community. ","I thank you, Mr. President, for convening today’s meeting on the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. We also thank Assistant Secretary-General Toyberg-Frandzen for his clear and objective briefing. We are grateful to Ambassadors Apakan and Tagliavini for briefing us today and for the brave and critically important role that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is continuing to play on the ground. This is the Security Council’s twenty-sixth meeting on the current crisis in Ukraine. If our message and the message of other countries today on the deteriorating situation in eastern Ukraine sounds familiar, it is for good reason. For while the situation has evolved, the root of the problem remains the same: Russia’s flagrant violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Time and again, Russia has made commitments and then failed to live up to them, and subsequently offered explanations to the Council that it knows are untrue. The most recent example involves the joint commitments made by Russia, the separatists it supports and Ukraine on 5 September in Minsk. They include an immediate end to the ceasefire violations, the restoration of Ukrainian control of its side of the international border, OSCE monitoring of the border and a security zone on either side of the border, as well as the withdrawal of foreign forces, mercenaries and equipment from Ukraine and the release of hostages and prisoners. On none of those have Russia or the separatists lived up to their word. At Minsk, all sides committed to an immediate ceasefire. Yet, rather than observe the ceasefire, the separatists have taken advantage of the agreed-upon pause in the fighting to try and expand their territory beyond Minsk lines. Meanwhile, Ukraine has maintained a full ceasefire along the agreed lines, as it defends its forces and population from separatists’ push for more. Over the last few days separatist attacks have increased significantly, including on positions around Donetsk airport, the city of Debaltseve and,of course, near Mariupol. At Minsk, all sides committed to permitting the OSCE to monitor and verify the ceasefire. Yet Russian- backed separatists have fired on OSCE monitoring drones and used jamming signals to interfere with its team members’ electronics using equipment supplied by Moscow. At Minsk, all sides agreed to permanent monitoring at the Ukrainian-Russian State border and the creation of a security zone along the border. Yet Russia has done nothing to restore Ukrainian Government control over the international border. Russia has refused to press separatists to allow the OSCE access to the border, and Russia continues to flout Ukrainian air space with its helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles. It also continues to send so-called humanitarian convoys — convoys it will not allow Ukrainian customs authorities or international monitors to search. At Minsk, all sides committed to immediately free all hostages and illegally held persons. Yet Russia and the separatists it backs continue to hold approximately 500 captives. Those captives include Ukrainian pilot Nadia Savchenko and Ukrainian film director Oleg Sentsov, both of whom were captured by separatists on Ukrainian soil and illegally transported against their will to Russia. At Minsk, Russia committed to remove all illegal military formations, military equipment and militants from Ukraine. Yet, rather than withdrawing its military forces from Ukraine and rather than cutting off its support for separatists, Russia is instead surging more forces and more equipment across the border. The Russian military has maintained a forward presence in eastern Ukraine since the ceasefire took effect. We have information indicating that a Russian air-defence system was operating near one of the separatist convoys in Donetsk. Russia has not provided that type of air- defence system to separatists to date, suggesting that Russian forces were protecting the convoy. On 9 November, the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission reported two convoys of 17 unmarked green trucks moving west through Donetsk towards the ceasefire line. Yesterday, 11 November, OSCE monitors observed the movement of 43 unmarked military vehicles on the eastern outskirts of Donetsk. Five were seen towing 120-millimetre howitzers and five others were towing multiple-launch rocket systems. NATO confirmed it had observed columns of Russian equipment — primarily Russian tanks, Russian artillery, Russian air-defence systems and Russian combat troops — entering Ukraine over the past 48 hours. The list goes on, but the pattern is clear. Where Russia has made commitments, it has failed to meet them. Russia negotiated a peace plan, then systematically undermined it at every step. It talks of peace, but it keeps fuelling war. That is not all. On 2 November, Russian-backed separatists held illegal elections in the parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that they control. The elections contravene Ukraine’s laws and its sovereignty. They defied point 9 of the Minsk protocol. But if Russia and the separatists intended the elections to cast a veneer of legitimacy on their actions, they failed. Instead, the world saw the elections for what they are: a shameless attempt to validate territory seized at the barrel of the gun — a gun provided by Russia. In keeping with its efforts to escalate rather than de-escalate at every turn, rather than condemn the separatists’ sham election like most of the international community, Russia encouraged it. Foreign Minister Lavrov even tried to argue that the elections were part of the Minsk agreements, which clearly stipulate that the elections be local and conducted “in accordance with the law of Ukraine”. Russian and separatist actions in eastern Ukraine currently have nothing to do with improving the humanitarian situation in Donbas, or decentralizing power, as called for in points 3 and 8 of the Minsk protocol. A recent Associated Press (AP) report from the rebel-held town of Perevalsk, part of the territory that recently declared independence from Ukraine, revealed the town was ruled by a local warlord who goes by the name of “batya” — or “daddy”. Daddy’s power is maintained by a group of armed Cossacks, whom he calls his Great Don Army, and four tanks outside his office fly Russian and rebel flags. Asked where his authority came from, Daddy told the AP reporter: “We are an independent organization and we don’t depend on anyone. I am answerable only to President Putin and Our Lord.” In neighbouring Alchevsk village rebel leaders preside over the kangaroo trials of people accused of crimes. Defendants are not given lawyers and their judges are whatever members of the community show up, who vote by a simple show of hands. That is what the separatist democracy looks like. We continue to see similar repressive tendencies in Russian-occupied Crimea, where members of the Tatar minority have been relentlessly persecuted and the free press muzzled. By contrast, Ukraine has made a genuine effort to live up to its agreements at Minsk and continues to show considerable restraint in response to constant provocation and attack. The Ukrainian people have repeatedly chosen leaders who call for de-escalation over escalation, first in the presidential election and then in parliamentary elections. Ukraine has also put in motion critically important reforms to reduce corruption and grant greater authority to its regions through constitutional reform. It has sought to maintain the ceasefire along the lines established at Minsk. The United States continues to support the Minsk peace process, and we continue to call for its full implementation. We remain prepared to roll back sanctions if the fighting stops, the border is closed, the foreign forces and equipment are withdrawn and hostages are released. We have said all along that there is no military solution to the crisis. The solution, as has been said, by the OSCE here today and United Nations, must be political. With Minsk we have a road map to reach that solution. The problem is, as it has long been throughout this crisis, you cannot reach a political solution if only one side is committed to forging it, and you cannot effectively implement a road map with parties who, like the Russians and the separatists they back, so consistently fail to keep their word. We have seen Russia’s playbook in Transnistria, South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Crimea — so the question is not what Russia will try to do in eastern Ukraine, the question is what we, the international community, will seek to do to prevent yet another frozen conflict in Europe manufactured by Russia. The Minsk agreement was brokered under the auspices of the international community; as such, there must be consequences when Russia flouts the commitments it has made and continues to destabilize its neighbour. Russia has not earned the good faith we would wish to bestow. Even when Russia claims, as Foreign Minister Lavrov did today, “the inadmissibility of disrupting the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements” actions are all that matter — and actions alongside these words show intentions. The Donetsk airport has come under attacks from artillery and arms fire four times in the past 24 hours, and in the past day Ukrainian positions have been shelled near Debaltseve, Avdiyivka, Hirske and Krasnohorivka. What we can do — what we must do — is keep ratcheting up the pressure on Russia until it abides by Minsk and chooses the path of de-escalation. Russia’s actions in Ukraine are a threat not only to the countries in Russia’s immediate vicinity but also to the international order. ",,,,,,,,,,,"I wish to start by thanking all of the briefers for the information they brought back from the ground. I thank Mr. Toyberg-Frandzen and our colleagues the Ambassadors for their political observations. I also thank the Security Council for having responded to my letter of 7 November (S/2014/798) and convened today’s meeting. In that letter, I drew the attention of the Council to the dangerously deteriorating security situation in the eastern part of Ukraine, which threatens our territorial integrity and shows a tendency to transform into a “frozen conflict”, and thus continues to be a challenge to peace and stability in the whole of Europe and beyond.
I should like to take this opportunity to thank all present for the solidarity that they have demonstrated today and in the past and for their constant support for our territorial integrity and the inviolability of our borders.
Ukraine remains devoted to the settlement of the conflict through diplomatic means. The establishment of a Trilateral Contact Group of senior representatives of Ukraine, the Russian Federation and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Chairman-in-Office is aimed at finding a political and diplomatic solution to the crisis. The Group held several meetings, including those in Minsk, on 5 and 19 September. The agreements reached at those meetings — a protocol and a memorandum dated 5 and 19 September, respectively — were supposed to become an important step towards a sustainable, mutually agreed ceasefire, a secure Russian/Ukrainian border and the return of peace and stability to eastern Ukraine, with the establishment of a special status zone, which is to be empowered with strong local self-government under Ukrainian law. The commitment to the implementation of the agreements was confirmed during the high-level meeting held in Milan on 17 October, in which the President of the Russian Federation participated. Despite their claims, the separatists and the Russian Federation, as their sponsor, continue to commit gross violations of the Minsk agreements. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, for his part, has expressed his disappointment and called upon the parties involved to fulfil their obligations.
I agree with what my Russian colleague said earlier, that in Russian the word “truth” has no plural form but that the word “lie” does. In that regard, I wish to draw the Council’s attention to a few major points concerning violations of the Minsk agreements.
The first point is that we agreed in Minsk on an immediate bilateral ceasefire and the withdrawal of illegal armed groups, military equipment and fighters and mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine. What happened instead? In breach of all of the agreements, militants backed by Russian regular forces continue to shell the Ukrainian military as well as civilian locations, in particular using Grad and Smerch systems. Since 5 September, Ukrainian forces and civilians have been shelled over 2,800 times. A total of 131 Ukrainian servicemen have been killed and more than 568 have been wounded. At least 65 civilians lost their lives.
Militants inspired by Russia are disregarding efforts to set up the touchline and continue to conduct offensive operations, trying to expand the area under their control. The large-scale recruitment and training of militants is taking place in the area of Donbas, which is temporarily out of Ukrainian Government control, as well as on the Russian side of the border. An offensive is expected in a number of locations along the touchline. We cannot exclude the possibility of an attempt to create a land corridor from Russia to temporarily occupied Crimea.
Another clear indication of violation of the Minsk agreements is the large amount of heavy weaponry, along with personnel and fuel, that after 5 September illegally entered Ukraine from Russian territory. A dangerous shipment of illegal armament supplies from Russia to militants was observed by Ukraine and the OSCE in the past few days. On 6 November, Ukrainian authorities detected the large-scale movement of heavy weaponry from Russian territory to the town of Krasny Luch in Ukraine: two columns, including 32 tanks, 16 howitzers and 30 Kamaz trucks, with soldiers and ammunition. The OSCE confirmed on 8 November the movement of two columns of 50 fully loaded trucks. Almost every truck had an artillery mount in tow. On 9 November, the OSCE recorded a convoy of 17 trucks 15 kilometres to the east of Donetsk. Five trucks transported Grad systems. On 10 November, the OSCE spotted another convoy of 17 trucks that supplied the terrorists with 122-millimetre howitzers and radio-location stations. On the same day, a second convoy of trucks, three of which carried radio-location stations, illegally crossed the border. Yesterday, the OSCE recorded a convoy of 43 trucks in the eastern part of Donetsk. Five of these trucks carried 122-millimetre howitzers and five others carried Grads. A Pantsir-1 anti-aircraft missile and gun system was spotted in the vicinity of the militants’ checkpoint near the town of Novoazovsk.
Illegal Russian convoys with heavy weapons are reported literally every day. The Russian delegation insisted today that its Government does not provide any military assistance to the separatists in Ukraine. This means that someone else besides the State has missiles, tanks and guns, and is supplying them to the illegal armed groups in Ukraine. It means that somebody else in Russia has attack aircraft and helicopters that are continually violating our State air border. The Russian delegation keeps saying that the Russian armed forces and military equipment have never crossed the borders of Ukraine. Does this mean that it is not the Russian Federation’s border guard that controls its side of the Ukraine-Russia border, but someone else who is permitting the illegal crossing of military convoys?
We have heard many times, here and from Moscow, about their readiness to withdraw the vast amount of arms and troops from the borders of Ukraine. Today, we have all the evidence we need to conclude that Ukraine is surrounded by a huge amount of armaments and troops. We demand that Russia explain here and now why it needs to maintain 200 tanks, 1,600 vehicles, 640 artillery units, 191 attack aircraft and 121 attack helicopters on our borders. Still, neither Ukraine nor the OSCE has received any kind of explanation.
The illegal movement of cargo from the territory of the Russian Federation through the State border, which the Russian delegation today characterized as humanitarian aid, to the civilians of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, is also a matter of deep concern to Ukraine. It was organized without seeking the official consent of the Ukrainian side, without completing the necessary border and customs procedures by the relevant Ukrainian authorities, and without coordinating with the International Committee of the Red Cross for its representatives to accompany the cargo, in breach of the national legislation of Ukraine and the agreements reached earlier. The latest so-called humanitarian convoys crossed the State border of Ukraine on 31 October and 2 and 4 November. We demand that the Russian Federation stop using the issue of humanitarian aid as a cover for delivering illegal supplies of troops, mercenaries and weapons to eastern Ukraine.
Contrary to these hostile actions and Russian propaganda myths, Ukrainian forces are observing the ceasefire regime. They make every effort to avoid full-scale military actions and use weapons only to defend themselves against militants’ attacks. Let me say very clearly that the only reason why open war has not started yet in the east of Ukraine is because of Ukraine’s restraint. We remain committed to a peaceful settlement and the Minsk arrangements, and urge Russia to do the same.
We agreed in Minsk that the OSCE would ensure the monitoring and verification of the ceasefire. We also agreed to that the OSCE would ensure the ongoing monitoring and verification of the Ukrainian-Russian border, and envisaged the creation of security zones in the border regions of Ukraine and the Russian Federation. Where are we with that? Ukraine has rendered all necessary assistance to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine to effectively implement its mandate.
Russian-supported militants have not extended security guarantees to OSCE personnel in all areas that they control, and obstruct the Mission’s monitoring activities. Moreover, in order to hide its violations, the Russian military uses cutting-edge electronic technology to jam OSCE drones, thereby disturbing monitoring efforts in the region in spite of the Minsk agreements. The Russian side has also refused to join the consensus on the proposed expansion of the mandate of the existing OSCE observation mission at two Russian border checkpoints to all Russian checkpoints along the 400-kilometre section of the border in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
With the Mission’s mandate set to expire on 23 November, we urge the Russian side to demonstrate a clear commitment to the peaceful resolution of the crisis in the eastern Ukraine by agreeing to allow OSCE observers to conduct their monitoring activities at all border crossings with Ukraine and along the entire length of the border in the area. That would contribute to establishing effective border verification by the OSCE, as foreseen in the Minsk agreements. Why is there such a stark difference in the approaches adopted by Ukraine and Russia to the role that the OSCE monitors can play in the current situation? Ukraine is open to transparent monitoring and control. Russia and its puppets are not.
Let me turn to my third point. We agreed in Minsk to adopt the Ukrainian law on provisional arrangements for local government in some areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts — the law on special status — and to ensure within the provisions of that law early local elections in some areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. The new law was adopted by the Ukrainian Parliament on 16 September. According to that law, local elections in some areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions were scheduled for 7 December and were intended to produce legitimate local self-governance that would make proper use of enhanced powers, engage in an inclusive national dialogue and ensure the reconstruction of Donbas, which has been severely damaged by the military activities of illegal armed groups. Ukraine rejects any rumours about alleged additional agreements on this issue. What was agreed was signed and what was signed was published, including the OSCE press releases.
Contrary to this, on 2 November Russian-backed terrorists held illegitimate elections for the so-called presidents and parliaments of illegitimate self-proclaimed entities in certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. These so-called elections were conducted in violation of Ukrainian legislation and international standards and contrary to the third and ninth articles of the Minsk protocol. By opting to recognize the illegal and illegitimate so-called elections in certain areas of Donbas, Russia has chosen time and again to violate the norms of international law and fundamental OSCE principles and commitments. It has chosen to act in breach of the Minsk agreements.
We are very concerned by the approach of the Russian Federation that consists in manipulating peoples’ right to self-determination. Once again, it has, as we saw in Crimea, only one priority — to feed separatism and create frozen conflicts in sovereign States that Russia treats as zones of national interest. That is why neither Ukraine nor the international community will ever recognize the illegal referendum in Crimea or the illegal pseudo-elections in certain areas of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions, whatever their outcomes.
The Ukrainian leadership has already expressed its deep concern over the violation of the Minsk agreements by Russia and the ring-leaders under its control in eastern Ukraine. Illegal elections and continuous violations of the ceasefire regime by militants, as well as a sharp increase in the illegal supply of weapons and military equipment across the border by the Russian Federation, have seriously undermined the Minsk process towards a peaceful settlement. They undermine any trust placed in signatories who fail to keep their word. Nevertheless, Kyiv has confirmed its commitment to continuing to observe the ceasefire regime in line with the Minsk agreements, and called on all involved in the process to swiftly resume settlement efforts.
We are seeking to make use of all possible mechanisms to forge a peaceful solution to the situation. We call on Russia, the European Union and the United States to meet together in the Geneva format in order to send a clear and consolidated message as well as strong impetus to the parties concerned to strictly adhere to the letter and spirit of the Minsk agreements. However, we will not yield to Russia’s attempts to compel implicit international recognition of the ring leaders of illegal entities in the Donbas by inviting them to this meeting.
We continue to demand that the Russian Federation stop backing illegal armed groups; immediately and strictly comply with the Minsk agreements by withdrawing its military forces and weaponry from the territory of Ukraine; establish joint customs and border control; release all Ukrainian hostages captured by Russian forces and their proxies; and stop its protracted military exercise in close vicinity to our borders. We continue to call on the Council to finally assume its Charter responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in order to put an end to the Russian aggression against Ukraine. I too do not want to continue this dialogue because it is going nowhere. I would just remind our Russian colleague, citing one of the most famous Russian writers, Turgenev:
(spoke in Russian)“There is one truth for everyone. Everyone has their own truth, but there is only one real truth.”(spoke in English)
The problem is that the Russian representative quoted two advisers to somebody, and raised the issue of trust. I do not have the quotation, but all of us remember that three or four times the Russian President promised the world community — the last time it was a decision — to withdraw those troops. That is why they are worrying about what is going on. We are worrying about where the armaments are coming from — from the regular Russian army or from somebody else in Russia? That is the question. I am asking about the position of the Russian leadership. Why, despite the promises, are huge amounts of armaments and personnel — around 49,000 people — still positioned along the Ukrainian border? This is about trust. How can we come back if we have lost confidence, if the Russian leadership — not our adviser to somebody, stating something — promised and and yet has failed to deliver?
I will give the Council the figures. They are not secret because they come from different sources. Council members may brief their colleagues in any format convenient to them, but that is what we have from a variety of sources. The OSCE keeps demanding, under agreements to which the Russian Federation is party, information concerning those flanks, limits and excercises which Russia is obligated to report. What are the troops doing? They have been carrying out exercises since February or March, without explanation. That is about trust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"An undeclared war is being waged by Russia against Ukraine. By now, it is barely making the world’s headlines because it is slow and creeping — a few more metres of captured land, a few more explosions, a few more Russian tanks, a few more dead at a time. As Europe marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Europe, Russia is doing its best to resuscitate the bygone era of division and brinkmanship, continuing its aggression against Ukraine, buttressed by bogus claims of defending Russian speakers from the advances of fascism and by outlandish accusations against Europe and the West.
The abduction of an Estonian intelligence officer on the Estonia side of the border and of a Ukrainian pilot in Ukraine; the alarming rise in the intensity and gravity of provocations involving Russian reconnaissance and fighter jets over an increasing territory, from the Baltic Sea region to Portugal, the United States, Canada and Japan — all point to a more aggressive unilateral Russian military posture going well beyond Ukraine’s borders.
The conflict in Ukraine is not an internal affair. It is neither a civil war nor a rebellion of disgruntled citizens. It is Russia’s war against Ukraine for daring to choose a different, European path. Sponsored by the Kremlin, the illegal armed separatists, many of whom carry Russian passports, have inflicted heavy damage on the Ukrainian forces and civilian population before and during the ceasefire, using sophisticated weaponry, tanks, multiple rocket launchers and heavy artillery. While Ukraine honoured the ceasefire agreement, Russia-backed separatists used the time to rearm and grab more territory. By now, those illegal armed groups are probably better armed than some of the smaller European armies — all thanks to Russia’s continued support and supplies.
We are profoundly worried by the recent reports of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, registering unmarked convoys of trucks carrying substantial amounts of heavy weaponry, ammunition, Grad multiple-launch rocket systems and howitzers, as well as armoured personnel carriers and tanks, moving cross the border and westwards inside the separatist held areas. That is a clear and blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement, which called for the withdrawal of Russian weapons and troops from Ukraine and a sealing of the border under international observation. Let us not forget that despite relevant provisions of the Minsk protocol on the establishment of a permanent OSCE presence along the Ukraine-Russia border, Russia single-handedly prevented the expansion of such a presence on the border, as a result of which OSCE observers monitor only 2 kilometres of the Russia-Ukraine border out of a total of 400 kilometres.
The holding by the separatists of illegal elections in eastern Ukraine is another clear violation of the Minsk agreements. Russia alone endorsed those sham elections and even arranged the presence of “observers” — a bunch of hard-line nationalists, Nazi sympathizers and xenophobes, tried and tested in the illegal plebiscite in Crimea. If Council members google the name of Mateusz Piskorski, they will find him posing in front of a swastika flag. Frank Creyelman is an open xenophobe, known for demanding amnesty for those who collaborated with the Hitler regime during the Second World War. Marton Gyongyosy once suggested that Hungarian Jews should be tallied up because they pose a threat to the State. Srđa Trifković is defender of Slobodan Milošević and an Islamophobe. Ewald Stadler is known for delivering one of the most racist speech ever in a European parliament. The list could go on.
It is with the help of such odious characters that Moscow is “fighting Fascism” in Ukraine. Little does it matter that Ukraine’s population squarely rejected the extreme forces during the recent national elections. As Russia flirts with Europe’s extremist fringe, the myth of Ukraine’s fascist junta continues to be advanced by Russia’s propaganda machine. What the Russian propaganda machine will not say, however, is that since Russian troops “liberated” Crimea, the human rights situation in the region has deteriorated dramatically, and that the separatist-held regions in eastern Ukraine have been repeatedly described by United Nations human rights reports as an abyss of lawlessness and criminality.
Russia’s disdain for the internationally accepted norms of behaviour, international law and the Charter of the United Nations is astounding, including the manipulation of all things humanitarian. Under the pretext of humanitarian aid, we have seen the preparation of what may be the seventh convoy now to be sent into Ukraine without Ukraine’s consent and in violation of Ukraine’s borders. While the humanitarian needs in the region have not diminished and remain dire, the armed separatists have been gaining ground with each new convoy. Today, the cost of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is some 400,000 displaced, at least 4,000 killed, over 9,000 wounded, and some 5.2 million people living in conflict-affected areas. The result of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is also Russia’s own young men returning home dead and anonymous in the notorious Cargo 200 boxes.
The Geneva statement, the Berlin joint declaration, the Minsk protocol and Minsk memorandum are the latest additions to the long list of documents and treaties that Russia has breached, from the 1991 Alma-Ata Declaration, the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, the 1997 Black Sea FleetAgreement Between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, and the Charter of the United Nations itself. Only a full and sustainable return to the ceasefire by all parties can defuse this increasingly bloody crisis before it gets completely out of hand — and that, with Russian troops amassed near Ukraine’s borders and increasing military movements in separatist held areas, could happen at any time.
Ukraine has been doing its part, and must continue to do so, by pursuing a wide range of necessary reforms, fighting corruption and reaching out to the affected regions to rebuild popular trust in the national Government. The onus, however, is on Russia and its militant proxies in eastern Ukraine to do theirs. Russia must stop threatening its neighbours, accept the spirit and letter of the Minsk agreements and allow unhindered international monitoring of the Ukrainian-Russian border. Russia must disown the separatists and condemn all attempts on the part of the self-proclaimed leaders to create parallel power structures in eastern Ukraine. As per the Minsk agreements, it must also withdraw its equipment, weapons and troops from Ukrainian territory and seal its borders to the movement of arms and mercenaries into the separatist-held areas.
A peaceful settlement of the crisis in eastern Ukraine is squarely in Russia’s hands. It bears full responsibility for the further escalation of the situation, and for creating another frozen conflict in Europe. Attempts to redraw Europe’s borders by military force 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall are criminal and undermine the very foundations on which the United Nations is built.
My delegation thanks the OSCE and the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights for the important observation and monitoring work that is being done on the ground, and stresses the importance of ensuring their continuing reporting and presence in the conflict-affected area. Providing an objective, unbiased alternative narrative is critical as Russia’s propaganda machinery expands its reach. My delegation reiterates its full support to Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. Ukraine’s European choice is not an imposition from the outside. It is the choice of the Ukrainian people who a year ago showed clearly that they have had enough of corruption, enough of cronyism, enough of kleptocracy. That choice was reaffirmed in the recent national elections and must be respected by all.","I thank the briefers for their statements.
We are concerned by the escalating violence and mounting civilian casualties in eastern Ukraine. The constant shelling, the fragile security situation, the teetering economy and an atmosphere of uncertainty are obstacles to the attainment of peace in the region. Strict adherence by all parties to the provisions of the Minsk protocol and the memorandum of 19 September is vital and urgent. We call on all concerned to keep genuine channels of communication open and take concrete steps to consolidate the ceasefire agreement. We emphasize that there can be no military solution to the crisis.
The elections conducted on 2 November in the separatist republics of Donetsk and Luhansk run counter to the spirit of the Minsk protocol and pose a threat to the peace, unity and sovereignty of Ukraine. Although the Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe recently stated that the elections would further complicate the implementation of the Minsk protocol, and we share that view, we urge all concerned, and in particular nations with influence over the parties, to continue to facilitate dialogue with a view to easing tensions, de-escalating the violence and ultimately arriving at a peaceful solution to the crisis. We would like to see Ukraine return to normalcy and its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity respected, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.","I, too, would like to thank the briefers for their presentations this afternoon.
Jordan is extremely concerned by the worsening security situation and the increase in shelling in eastern Ukraine, which follows a period of tenuous calm in the region. We now fear a resumption of full-scale fighting. If the situation is not brought under control, there could be spillover effects beyond Ukraine and into the entire region.
Jordan believes that the military build-up and the illegal flow of weapons into Ukraine, as stated in the report of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, are violations of the Minsk agreements. Any attempt by the parties to resume the fighting flouts international efforts aimed at reaching a lasting and peaceful solution to the conflict. We reiterate our call to all parties, in particular armed groups, to show restraint and discipline, calm the situation and make intensive, serious and sincere efforts to prevent a further worsening of the situation, which would be dire for all concerned.
Any deferral of a political solution based on the peace agreements will only further exacerbate violence and instability and bring about a worsening of the humanitarian situation, which must be addressed. Any delay will only further prolong the ongoing investigation of the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 crash. The shared challenges have to be tackled by all Ukrainians across the board, be they in the east or the west of the country. I am referring to the political reforms, national reconciliation and economic development. Those shared challenges and can be tackled only through cooperation among all the parties so as to ensure that the conflict not worsen irreversibly.
In that regard, the holding of legislative elections in the country on 26 October was an important step on the path to political reform, which the Ukrainian Government has committed itself to. We therefore encourage the Government to continue its efforts to step up the national dialogue and to put in place all the necessary political and economic reforms that can contribute to the national reconciliation process among all members of Ukrainian society.
Jordan will continue to back the Minsk agreements. We stress the importance of cooperation among all parties for a comprehensive and swift implementation of all the provisions of the agreements, including provisions regarding the ceasefire and the halting of weapons flows. We emphasize the need to uphold and maintain the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, as undermining those would be a violation of international law.
We also recall that it is crucial that there be no impunity or immunity for those having perpetrated violations or acts of violence. We further recall that such individuals must be brought before justice to ensure that the situation in Ukraine not further deteriorate.","We thank the Assistant Secretary-General ad interim for Political Affairs, Mr. Toyberg-Frandzen, and we appreciate the presence of Ambassadors Apakan and Tagliavini at this meeting. We also welcome Ambassador Sergeyev, Permanent Representative of Ukraine, to the Security Council today.
We regret that the Council has had to be convened today and express our deep concern at the further escalation of the crisis in the east and south of Ukraine. We are concerned about information with respect to a possible foreign military support in eastern Ukraine and what the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has told us. It is urgent that the ceasefire be fully respected, monitored and verified by the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, in accordance with the provisions of the Minsk agreements. We trust that all the parties will be able to implement the Minsk agreement, which is an inclusive political instrument aimed at achieving peace and calm for the entire population of eastern Ukraine.
We regret the worsening security situation in the east of the country which has had serious consequences for the civilian population, which continues to suffer violations and human rights abuses from all actors. It is urgent that the increasing humanitarian needs in south-eastern Ukraine be addressed, as the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and other United Nations agencies have pointed out. The dramatic increase in the number of internally displaced persons is one of the most disturbing elements. The delivery of humanitarian assistance must go forward without delay and in accordance with humanitarian principles. The efforts of the international community must be harnessed in support of the host Government, which bears the primary responsibility for assistance and protection.
We stress the importance of strengthening the rule of law and the obligation to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, General Assembly resolution 68/262 and international law. It is also necessary to observe the principle of non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of another State. Finally, we urge the parties to seek a peaceful solution to this crisis through direct political dialogue, exercise restraint and refrain from unilateral actions that could increase tensions.
We reiterate our support for the efforts that the Secretary-General and the United Nations continue to undertake to resolve the situation in Ukraine. We also hope that the various independent international mechanisms will continue to contribute to finding a solution to the crisis.","I would first like to thank Ambassadors Tagliavini and Apakan for their statements, and Mr. Jens Anders Toyberg-Frandzen, Assistant Secretary-General Ad Interim for Political Affairs, for his briefing.
Chad remains concerned about the deterioration of the security situation in Ukraine, particularly in the eastern part of the country. In the past few days we have seen a resurgence in the fighting between the Ukrainian army and the separatists. The city of Donetsk is the scene of exchanges of artillery, mortar and automatic weapon fire. Several sources also confirm that the parties to conflict have been firing fragmentation shells in urban areas. Chad condemns such acts of violence and calls for an immediate end to armed confrontations in accordance with the ceasefire established by the Minsk agreement. Chad also deplores the radicalization of the parties’ positions, with the announcement, on one hand, by Poroshenko’s Government that it has suspended all financial aid to Donbas and frozen €2.6 million in salaries and various forms of assistance, and, on the other, the separatists’ holding of elections on 2 November in Donetsk and Luhansk, in flagrant violation of the Minsk agreement and the Constitution of Ukraine. All of that chiefly affects the civilian population, which has already paid a heavy toll in the conflict. According to the United Nations, since the start of the conflict in April more than 4,000 people have died, many of them civilians, and more than 5,000, whose situation will worsen as winter approaches, have been internally displaced.
In the face of this escalating situation, we urge the parties to the conflict to act calmly and with restraint. Like other members of the Council, Chad believes that finding a political solution is the only way to emerge from the crisis. In that regard, we encourage the Government of Ukraine to find a path to a direct and inclusive national dialogue focused on national reconciliation. Chad also urges the countries that have the capacity to influence the parties to the conflict to use that influence to help achieve peace in Ukraine, with respect for its territorial integrity, sovereignty and unity, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.","I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Australia.
I thank our briefers today, including those from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), in which we place great confidence for its indispensable monitoring role on the ground. We also welcome Ukraine’s Permanent Representative, Ambassador Sergeyev.
Two weeks ago, Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs Fernandez-Taranco told the Council the Minsk protocols were not being fully implemented and that the ceasefire was being violated regularly, causing violent loss of life. He described how the security situation was hampering the return and settlement of internally displaced persons, which was becoming increasingly urgent with the onset of winter. His report was of concern then, but the situation in eastern Ukraine has now deteriorated much further.
As Assistant Secretary-General Toyberg-Frandzen has just told us, the ceasefire is “under continuous and serious strain” and Minsk is “in jeopardy”. Ambassador Tagliavini spoke of the “blunt disregard for ... commitments undertaken in Minsk”. We have seen consistent and credible reports of Russian-supplied military reinforcements, including heavy weapons and tanks, moving to the front line of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The OSCE Chief Monitor, Ambassador Apakan, has just described three separate sightings of such convoys by OSCE monitors.
We must all be seriously concerned at these further escalations in eastern Ukraine and at Russia’s ongoing violations of the Minsk protocols, particularly its failure to withdraw all its personnel from Ukraine. And, in further violation of the Minsk protocols, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has been prevented from monitoring adequately the Ukraine/Russia border, where Russian troops appear — once again — to be massing in significant numbers. As Assistant Secretary-General Toyberg-Frandzen has just told us, failure to secure the border is a threat to peace. This is all ominously reminiscent of the situation prior to Russia’s purported annexation of Crimea. We have seen this positioning before.
These recent developments come against the backdrop of the so-called elections in eastern Ukraine. These illegitimate, pseudo-elections have been widely condemned around the world, including by the Secretary-General. They were another direct contravention of the Minsk protocol, which clearly states that elections must be held “in accordance with the law of Ukraine”.
Australia welcomes the legitimate parliamentary elections that were held in Ukraine on 26 October. It was encouraging to note the report from the OSCE affiliated Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights praising the conduct of the Ukrainian parliamentary elections and the impartial and efficient Central Election Commission. Australia looks forward to working with the new Government of Ukraine. It is wrong, of course, that people in Crimea and many in the separatist-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine were unable to exercise their democratic right to vote. We commend the Ukrainian authorities for their efforts to enfranchise as many people as possible in these very difficult circumstances.
The Jordanian representative a few moments ago mentioned the risk from the deteriorating security situation to access to the MH-17 crash site. I must emphasize that Australia remains determined to do all it can to bring those responsible for the downing of MH-17 to justice. We are committed to making a full international return to the MH-17 crash site when it is safe to do so and in the company of our Dutch and Malaysian partners. We appreciate Russian President Putin’s confirmation to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott yesterday, meeting in Beijing, of Russia’s commitment to resolution 2166 (2014), which we all adopted in July, including its support for a full, thorough and independent international investigation into the cause of the crash, and for ensuring complete access for international experts to the crash site. This can, however, happen only if Russian-backed and Russian-armed separatists comply with the ceasefire.
More broadly, adherence to the ceasefire and to the commitments made in the Minsk protocol is essential to move to a lasting political solution in Ukraine, which must be based on respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. But without a genuine engagement from Russia, this plan will obviously come to nothing. This brings us back to the root cause of the deteriorating security situation in Ukraine: Russia’s persistent campaign of deliberate destabilization. Russia’s actions are continuing to fuel the unrest and are undermining the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. The Russian economy is already paying a heavy price for that action, and any further actions can only inevitably lead to even greater consequences for Russia.
There is a clear path forward to end the violence in eastern Ukraine: Russia must withdraw all support to the separatists; remove all its personnel and assets from Ukraine; and engage in genuine dialogue with Ukraine. The OSCE must also be allowed to do its job and monitor unimpeded the Ukraine/Russia border as set out in the Minsk protocol. Russia’s continued refusal to heed the international community’s call to de-escalate the crisis can only lead to Russia’s further isolation.
I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.
I now give the floor to the representative of Ukraine.",,,,"I would like to thank Mr. Jens Anders Toyberg-Frandzen, Assistant Secretary-General Ad Interim for Political Affairs, Ambassador Ertuğrul Apakan, Chief Monitor of the special monitoring mission to Ukraine of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and Ambassador Heidi Tagliavini, representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office, for their briefings on the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. I would also like to recognize the presence in the Chamber of the Permanent Representative of Ukraine to the United Nations.
Since our last briefing, on 24 October (see S/PV.7287), the security situation in Ukraine has deteriorated further, despite the extensive diplomatic efforts deployed in the region over the past month. It seems that when the region takes a step forward, the parties respond with two steps backwards, at the expense of the civilian population. We should remember, as Ambassador Tagliavini has reminded us, that winter is around the corner and that with increased fighting, coupled with a shortage of gas in Ukraine, a humanitarian disaster is looming.
It is disappointing that despite the signing of the Minsk protocol and memorandum on 5 and 19 September, respectively, the parties seem unwilling to implement those agreements. We are seriously concerned about the continued violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, the massive reinforcement of the armed separatists with heavy weaponry, including via military convoys, as well as the continued shelling in populated areas, including, last week, of a school. In that context, we commend the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission for its continuing role in verifying the ceasefire on Ukraine’s eastern border. We note that it is facing serious challenges, including problems with the safety of its personnel and a lack of necessary equipment. We urge all parties, particularly the armed separatists, to assist the Mission in implementing its mandate, and we also encourage those who have the capacity to provide the monitors with the equipment they need to do so, in order to improve the success of its activities.
It is unfortunate that the deterioration of the security situation in Ukraine comes on the heels of the parliamentary elections of 26 October, which were viewed as free, fair and peaceful, despite the fact that there were no polling stations in the rebel-held areas. In that regard, we believe that the subsequent elections organized on 2 November by the armed separatists are unconstitutional and undermine the Minsk protocol and memorandum. In a context of heightened tension and escalation, we note with concern statements from all sides that may jeopardize even the provisions of the Minsk agreements that had begun to be implemented, such as those on the exchange of prisoners of war and the law on interim local self-government. It is therefore imperative that, given the alarming situation, all the signatories recommit to implementing the Minsk agreements and that members of the Trilateral Contact Group use their influence to end the dangerous escalation. Otherwise, despite our collective commitment made yesterday on the occasion of Remembrance Day, the situation could get out of hand and lead to another full-blown regional war on the European continent.
I would like to conclude by recalling that, despite the fact that we all agree that the situation in Ukraine has become a threat to international peace and security, the Security Council is still discussing it based on letters sent by Permanent Representatives in New York back in February (S/2014/136) and April (S/2014/264). While I am aware of the deep division in the Council on the substance, as demonstrated by its persistent lack of any pronouncement on the issue, I believe it is time for the 15 to at least agree that the Council should remain seized of the matter under a specific agenda item, “The situation in Ukraine”.","Ukraine, which follows a period of tenuous calm in the region. We now fear a resumption of full-scale fighting. If the situation is not brought under control, there could be spillover effects beyond Ukraine and into the entire region.
Jordan believes that the military build-up and the illegal flow of weapons into Ukraine, as stated in the report of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, are violations of the Minsk agreements. Any attempt by the parties to resume the fighting flouts international efforts aimed at reaching a lasting and peaceful solution to the conflict. We reiterate our call to all parties, in particular armed groups, to show restraint and discipline, calm the situation and make intensive, serious and sincere efforts to prevent a further worsening of the situation, which would be dire for all concerned.
Any deferral of a political solution based on the peace agreements will only further exacerbate violence and instability and bring about a worsening of the humanitarian situation, which must be addressed. Any delay will only further prolong the ongoing investigation of the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 crash. The shared challenges have to be tackled by all Ukrainians across the board, be they in the east or the west of the country. I am referring to the political reforms, national reconciliation and economic development. Those shared challenges and can be tackled only through cooperation among all the parties so as to ensure that the conflict not worsen irreversibly.
In that regard, the holding of legislative elections in the country on 26 October was an important step on the path to political reform, which the Ukrainian Government has committed itself to. We therefore encourage the Government to continue its efforts to step up the national dialogue and to put in place all the necessary political and economic reforms that can contribute to the national reconciliation process among all members of Ukrainian society.
Jordan will continue to back the Minsk agreements. We stress the importance of cooperation among all parties for a comprehensive and swift implementation of all the provisions of the agreements, including provisions regarding the ceasefire and the halting of weapons flows. We emphasize the need to uphold and maintain the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, as undermining those would be a violation of international law.
We also recall that it is crucial that there be no impunity or immunity for those having perpetrated violations or acts of violence. We further recall that such individuals must be brought before justice to ensure that the situation in Ukraine not further deteriorate. responsibility to safeguard international peace and security.
We deplore the fact that, until now, despite the many times we have met to deal with this situation, we have not been able to play a positive role and overcome the divisions that prevent the Council from contributing to the parties finding the necessary points in common in order to move forward towards a diplomatic solution and put an end to the confrontations, which are especially punishing on the civilian population.
As we seek to move the crisis onto the diplomatic track, there is a need to cotinue to respond to the difficult humanitarian situation being experienced by persons affected by the crisis. We recognize the work being carried out by humanitarian workers to ensure access to assistance to those who need it, in a context that poses many security challenges. We call on all parties to facilitate the distribution of humanitarian assistance on the basis of non-discrimination and in full cooperation with humanitarian actors.
At the same time, we underscore that it is essential that independent investigations be conducted in response to all reports of human rights violations and abuses and violations of international humanitarian law, so that those responsible, no matter to whom they report, be accountable for their actions.
The parties in Ukraine and those who have influence on them are facing a critical moment. They have two clear options before them — working in a genuine fashion to restore calm and peacefully resolve the crisis so that Ukraine may return to the path of growth with inclusion, or immersing itself in unnecessary and fruitless conflict. It is not too late to choose the first path. Argentina will continue to firmly support all efforts for peace and the decisions taken to that end.","I too would like to thank the Assistant Secretary-General ad interim for Political Affairs, Mr. Jens Anders Toyberg-Frandzen, for his briefing. I also thank Ambassador Ertuğrul Apakan, Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission, and Ambassador Heidi Tagliavini, representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office, for making themselves available to us and for the invaluable information they have provided to the Council on the critical situation in Ukraine.
Luxembourg fully supports the efforts of the Swiss Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE to find a political solution to the crisis, while fully upholding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We also support the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, which has a key role to play to promote the de-escalation of tensions by providing objective information on the situation on the ground.
We are very concerned by the serious deterioration of the situation in eastern Ukraine since 2 November, when the separatists held illegal elections in the regions of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts under their control. While the Minsk protocol and memorandum, signed on 5 and 19 September, respectively, paved the way for a peaceful end to the conflict, non-compliance with key provisions of the Minsk agreements has led to a new escalation of tensions and a worsening situation in several regions of eastern Ukraine.
The growing number of violations of the 5 September ceasefire agreement are compounded by worrisome omens. We are concerned about the recent build-up of Russian troops in the immediate proximity of the Ukrainian border. We are also concerned about the increased movements of military convoy in separatist-controlled areas heading for Ukrainian army positions. As has been noted, in recent days the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission has reported sightings of large convoys of military trucks without license plates transporting troops and heavy weapons, including howitzers. A convoy of nine tanks — four T-72s and five T-64s — heading west was observed by the Mission on Saturday, 8 November. These movements of troops and heavy weaponry are accompanied by intensified bombing, especially in Donetsk.
We condemn the sham elections held on 2 November in the eastern regions of Ukraine controlled by the separatists, with the blessing of Russia. We do not recognize those elections. They are illegal under the Constitution and Ukrainian law. They constitute a flagrant violation of the commitments that Russia and the representatives of illegal armed groups made when signing the Minsk protocol. Those sham elections do not legitimize the warlords at the head of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, just as the illegal referendum in Crimea does not and will not legitimize the annexation of the peninsula by Russia. Successive reports of the Special Monitoring Mission bear witness to serious violations of human rights committed since April in areas occupied by armed separatist groups. These individuals cannot claim to speak for the people of Donbas. The Secretary-General and the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office have rightly denounced the elections of 2 November as an obstacle to efforts to find a political solution to the conflict.
We welcome the concrete steps taken by Ukraine to meet its commitments under the Minsk agreements, in particular the adoption of laws providing for amnesty and the temporary status of local autonomy. In addition to scrupulously observing a ceasefire, of particular importance is the withdrawal of armed groups, military equipment, combatants and illegal mercenaries, as well as securing the border between Ukraine and Russia and its permanent monitoring with OSCE verification. It is crucial in this context that the Mission’s monitoring of the border posts at Gukovo and Donetsk be extended to other border-crossing areas as soon as possible.
It becomes more urgent every day to end the conflict impacting Ukraine. The conflict has already killed more than 4,000 people since April. The victims include numerous children, including two struck down on 5 November by mortar shells on a school playing field in Donetsk. The killing must stop. The solution to the conflict has been identified; it includes the good-faith implementation of the Minsk protocol of 5 September and the Minsk memorandum of 19 September, signed by all parties to the conflict, with the decisive verification support of the OSCE.
Ukraine has demonstrated in deed its determination to pursue the path of peace. We call on the separatists and Russia to do the same so as to halt the spiral of conflict. We call on the Russian Federation to shoulder its responsibilities in the full and complete implementation of the Minsk agreements by preventing all military movement of weapons or combatants from its territory into Ukraine and by exercising its influence on the separatists to fulfil the obligations to which they have subscribed under the Minsk agreements.","I would like to thank Mr. Toyberg-Frandzen, Ambassador Apakan and Ambassador Tagliavini for their briefings on the situation in eastern Ukraine.
We are acutely alarmed by the observations reported by the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, detailing the influx of military equipment, weapons and armed personnel into the region of Ukraine held by armed rebel groups. It represents a clear violation of the Minsk agreements, a serious encroachment on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and a challenge to the future of the country. The Minsk protocol and memorandum of September offered the basis for hope towards a peaceful and viable resolution of the crisis. They provided the parties concerned with a measure of political space to build upon. However, such early hopes have turned into worries that the conflict may again escalate. The withdrawal of foreign troops and military equipment under OSCE monitoring is an integral part of the Minsk agreements, which must be fully implemented. We urge all concerned parties to stop any provocative actions that may derail the fragile peace process, as embodied in the Minsk agreements. All outside military intervention in the situation must cease immediately.
Regarding political developments in the country, we welcome the holding of parliamentary elections on 26 October, which proved to be orderly and peaceful. We very much hope that the election results, together with national reconciliation and a process of dialogue, will pave the way for much needed stability throughout the country. In that regard, the separate elections held by armed rebel groups in eastern Ukraine earlier this month run counter to the spirit of a dialogue-based resolution of the situation. They also undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We hope that the political track based on the Minsk agreements can be restored and put back into force as soon as possible.
We commend the role of OSCE, the United Nations and other partners in seeking a peaceful political resolution of the situation, and we stand ready to support such efforts."
S/PV.7287,24/10/2014,Briefings on humanitarian and military situations in Ukraine; discussion of the implementation of the Minsk agreements.,"I wish to thank Assistant Secretary-General Fernandez-Taranco and Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for their briefings. China notes that, since the signing of the Minsk agreements between the Ukrainian Government and eastern militias at the beginning of September, there have been no large-scale armed clashes in eastern Ukraine. However, the security situation on the ground still remains fragile with sporadic violent attacks in violation of the ceasefire agreement, causing casualties and damage to infrastructure. China is deeply worried and concerned about the situation. The top priority now is for the parties concerned to implement effectively and comprehensively the Minsk agreements and to ensure the realization of a ceasefire and cessation of violence in eastern Ukraine. That is the fundamental way to ease the humanitarian situation of the country, and it will create the necessary conditions for the provision of humanitarian assistance. China hopes that the international community will continue to play a constructive role in the improvement of the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. China maintains its consistent position that the United Nations human rights organs and international humanitarian relief agencies should adhere to the principles of objectivity and neutrality in carrying out their work. The question of Ukraine involves a complex history that has a bearing on contemporary issues. The parties concerned should address the root of the problem and find a fundamental solution. While the legitimate rights, interests and claims of all regions and ethnic groups in Ukraine should be fully accommodated, attention must be given to addressing the legitimate concerns of the parties and to achieving a balance of interests among all parties. A political solution is the only proper way to solve the question of Ukraine. China hopes that the parties concerned will continue to implement the Minsk agreements, to further carry out constructive efforts and interaction and to launch as soon as possible an inclusive dialogue that will reach a balanced, durable and comprehensive political settlement of the question of Ukraine. The international community should prevail on the parties concerned to make full use of existing communication channels and opportunities for dialogue, take actions conducive to the establishment of mutual trust and avoid confrontation. China supports any effort that will help the parties to engage in dialogue and consultations leading to a political settlement of the crisis, and we will continue to play an active and constructive role in seeking a political settlement of the question of Ukraine. ","I would like to thank Mr. Fernandez-Taranco and Mr. Šimonović for their briefings, and my British colleague for initiating this meeting. The human rights situation in Ukraine continues to deteriorate, as the sixth report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights based on the work of the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine makes clear. It has been marked by an escalation of hostilities that came to a head at the beginning of September, just before the signing of the ceasefire agreement. The report emphasizes that for the fighting to have reached such a level of intensity, the pro-Russian militias must have been supported by many foreign fighters, including Russians, and must also have been reinforced with sophisticated weaponry. Those responsible for the escalation are the same as those who several months ago decided that Ukrainian sovereignty could be violated, in defiance of the Charter of the United Nations. Since the signing of the Minsk agreements, the front as a whole has stabilized, leading to a diminished overall level of violence, although the ceasefire is regularly violated and fighting continues here and there owing to the separatists’ wish to homogenize their territory. The situation this summer led to a significant increase in casualties, both civilian and military, and to an increase in violations of human rights, including recourse to torture, summary executions and abductions. We condemn all violations of international standards, including the protection of human rights that should be respected by all parties to the conflict. That is especially true in the areas controlled by the separatists, in which people are indeed living in fear and under threat and from which thousands of civilians have fled. We should remember that the death penalty has been reinstated in Donetsk; that when people leave their homes, they are confiscated; and that there are no more police or courts to defend Ukrainians against the arbitrary decisions of militias. As a result, thousands of people have taken to the road, forced to leave everything they own. With winter approaching, the displaced populations will be in a seriously precarious situation. We are also following with concern the deteriorating situation for the people of Crimea. The Tatars, in particular, are experiencing abuse from self-defence groups as well as numerous administrative problems, expropriations and arbitrary arrests. Their human rights, such as the freedoms of expression, religion, conscience and movement, are routinely flouted. In that regard, we wish to reiterate our commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine’s international borders. Against that bleak backdrop, a new dynamic has nonetheless emerged. With the ceasefire agreed in Minsk on 5 September, followed by the 19 September agreement, a diplomatic process has finally begun between Kyiv and Moscow. France, together with its European partners, will continue to support that engagement between the Russians and the Ukrainians, in particular within the framework of the format agreed in Normandy in June. Those agreements offer a sound basis for envisioning a solution to the crisis that is based on three pillars: respect for the ceasefire, the monitoring of the border, and political discussions aimed at finding a lasting solution. The discussions are taking place, and Presidents Putin and Poroshenko met in Milan last week on the sidelines of the Asia-Europe summit. There has been some progress on border monitoring and the monitoring of the cease-fire, generally speaking. Nevertheless, we will remain vigilant to ensure that support for the separatists finally ceases, that the weakening of the State and the rule of law is checked, and that the ceasefire is fully respected. We are awaiting the securing of the Russian-Ukrainian border and its permanent monitoring under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). We believe the mandate of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Russian territory should be strengthened and expanded as quickly as possible to cover other border crossings. Those efforts testify to our collective commitment to resolve the crisis in Ukraine. But that crisis can only be resolved if all the actors act in equal good faith. We welcome the measures taken by Ukraine to implement its commitments, in particular the adoption by the Ukrainian parliament of a law envisioning an interim status of local autonomy for certain regions. In that regard, we would hope that the establishment of that new status through upcoming local elections might provide an opportunity for all parties to resolutely commit to a de-escalation and to a solution to the crisis. Furthermore, we call on all parties to work effectively to make it possible to hold early parliamentary elections this Sunday, in accordance with international standards and on all of the Ukrainian territory. Those elections are crucial to enable Ukraine to continue on its necessary path of reforms. Those who oppose the election would be demonstrating their rejection of compromise and peace. The elections on Sunday are an opportunity for a fresh start for Ukraine, for Russia and for stability in the whole region. ","This is about the twenty-fifth meeting to date in which we have discussed the internal Ukrainian crisis, which has basically been transformed into a civil war. Yet despite dense planning and significant international efforts carried out under various formats, over a period of months Ukraine’s slide towards the abyss has only accelerated. What is the reason for that? The answer is staring us in the face. From the very beginning of the crisis, we have warned that last winter’s events in Ukraine — which were encouraged by crude external interference that led to a coup d’état — could open a deep division of the country that could be overcome only through national dialogue with the participation of all regions, political powers and ethnic groups and respect for their interests and rights. Those principles, which opened a genuine path towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict, were agreed by Russia, the United States, Ukraine and the European Union on 17 April, in Geneva, but they have not been implemented. Not everyone among the new-old Ukrainian elite or among its foreign sponsors agreed with them. There has been no dialogue or promised constitutional reform. Instead of moving towards a balanced solution that would have helped to stabilize the situation and strengthen Ukrainian unity, the war party in Kyiv continually received prompting from Western capitals to conduct a punitive operation, to fight dissent, thus undermining economic, cultural and humanitarian links with Russia. In trying to prevent an escalation of the crisis, we urged the parties involved to stop tearing Ukraine apart and setting before it the false choice of being either with the European Union (EU) and the West, or with Russia. What are we seeing today? Today in Kyiv and in Brussels, as a matter of fact, everyone has returned to the issue we should have started with — delaying the association agreement with the EU, which the ousted President Yanukovych had sought to postpone. The cost of delaying that decision for almost a year is thousands of lives, almost a million refugees and internally displaced persons, a destroyed economy and a civil war, and the very severe situation being endured by civilians in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, to whom we will continue to provide urgent humanitarian assistance. We are ready to cooperate with the Ukrainian authorities and with the International Committee of the Red Cross to that end, but we will accept no obstruction, whatever the hypocrites may say. Some colleagues on the Council and other lofty bodies have stated more than once that the Maidan uprising and the following internal political processes resulted from the democratic aspirations of the Ukrainian people and their expectations with regard to European values and rule of law. That is commendable. However, what are we really seeing? There are those in Ukraine who truly desire the civilized development of their country; there are many such people, and we can only commiserate with them. The current election campaign is especially characterized by bad faith and cynicism. The political field has been cleansed of competitors, both figuratively and literally. A law on lustration has been adopted, which is the precursor of a major witch hunt. Dissent is subject to intimidation and violence. Lynch mobs are modelled on foreign exemplars. Media outlets that stray from the general line are being closed. If a television channel broadcasts in Russian or if a newspaper even contains the word “Russian” in its name, it is immediately considered to be separatist. Against that background, our concern about Ukraine arises from the growth of neo-Nazi sentiment there, encouraged by authorities in Kyiv. On 14 and 15 October in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa and a number of other cities in Ukraine, parades of torch-carrying neo-Nazis with fascist insignia were held. At meetings people quote Hitler. There are calls for violent actions against representatives of different ethnic groups. Following precedents that are unfortunately known in history, there have been public burnings ofundesirable publications in Kyiv. In another act that can only be considered blasphemous the authorities in Kyiv have designated the date of 14 October — the date on whichthe so-called Ukrainian Insurgent Army was formed — as the Day of the defence of the Fatherland. That group was guilty of criminal collaboration with the Nazis during the Second World War, having been involved in the murder of tens and hundreds of thousands of innocent people — Jews, Poles, Russians, even Ukrainians who refused to collaborate with them. It is particularly unacceptable to see such actions on the eve of the seventieth anniversary of the victory in the Second World War. That proclamation grossly violates the General Assembly resolution 67/154 — adopted seven times at the initiative of the Russian Federation — which condemns the celebration of Nazis as heroes. Furthermore, that proclamation poses a serious threat to the post-war world order and to international peace and security. With that kind of ideological baggage, can Ukraine really intend to move towards Europe? Our eloquent Western colleagues have said nothing about that - as if they had lost their sense of smell. We think it strange and unacceptable that the topic was completely left out of today’s briefings by the United Nations officials, Mr. Fernandez-Taranco and Mr. Šimonović. We call on them to focus, as a priority, on combating the glorification of Nazism and countering attempts to rewrite history. Resolution 67/154 calls on everyone to do just that. Prospects for a political resolution in Ukraine have taken on a realistic character since the signature in September of the Minsk protocol and the Minsk memorandum. Our hope for those agreements’ viability stems from the fact that they are based on direct agreement between Kyiv and the south- eastern part of the country, which was achieved with the contribution of Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Such was not the case in the past. Also important is the fact that, thanks to the Minsk process, major military clashes have been brought to an end and major principles of peacekeeping observed. It is true that there have been violations. But that only points to the need for painstaking work and good-faith international support for the negotiations with a view to ensuring the full implementation of what the representatives of Ukraine and the armed groups agreed to in Minsk. At the recent Asia-Europe Meeting, President Vladimir Putin of Russia once again clearly underscored our support for efforts to ensure full implementation of the Minsk agreements. At the same time, the Milan negotiations have shown that it is vital for the essence of the agreements to be upheld and for its implementation to occur in a certain sequence. A report of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine was mentioned today. Unfortunately, once again, the report is very far from being objective. In fact, it was the Kyiv authorities that invited the mission in, and they have been guiding its activities. Nevertheless, certain facts that do not favour the Kyiv authorities cannot be ignored. One can’t ignore the violations of the norms of international humanitarian law committed by the Kyiv security forces, blatant facts that include the disappearance of people, killings, looting, extortion and arbitrary detentions, all of which have been carried out by the Ukrainian military and other battalions under the control of the Kyiv authorities, specifically, the Aidar, Azov, Dnepr, Kyiv-1 and Kyiv-2 battalions. At the same time, ordinary Ukrainians are being harshly detained under the pretext that they have been involved in terrorism. There is an alarming and growing number of civilian victims, including children, as the result of indiscriminate artillery fire in densely populated areas, as well as the use of heavy weapons, prohibited munitions, including cluster bombs and phosphorus munitions, and tactical rockets. There has been a lack of progress in the investigation into the deaths of people on the “Maidan” and the tragedies in Odessa and Mariupol, as well as attempts to meddle with or conceal evidence. It is essential to investigate objectively and thoroughly the graves of peaceable citizens found in Nyzhnia Krynka. We also continue to be concerned about the investigation of the Malaysian Airline Boeing disaster: it is clearly not a coincidence that the crash site came under fire from Ukrainian positions on 13 October when the Dutch expert group and the observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were there. The reporting in one of the statements we heard today of an unconfirmed version of what happened there is irresponsible. We still do not understand the nervous reaction of certain members of the Security Council to our proposal of 19 September calling for the investigation to be expanded and deepenedCrimea was mentioned again today. During the years that the peninsula was forced to be part of Ukraine, many socioeconomic problems accumulated. Russia will try to solve them in a systematic way. That will not be affected by efforts on the part of the Kyiv authorities to take revenge on the population of Crimea for their decision to join Russia. The Kyiv authorities have erected all kinds of obstacles and have been broadcasting anti-Crimean propaganda in an unbridled manner. Unfortunately, instead of working collectively to analyse the very severe problems in Ukraine and attempting to resolve the situation, some members of the Security Council have, as is their custom, expressed unqualified support for all of the actions of the Kyiv authorities, even though the latter represent the party of war. That support is based on their cynical geopolitical calculations that have nothing to do with the interests of the Ukrainian people. What everyone, including the Security Council, should in fact be doing is to help the parties to the conflict to maintain complete observance of the ceasefire, prevent bloodshed, and engage in an honest and fundamental national dialogue on issues of constitutional reform and rebuilding a Ukrainian State on a just and inclusive basis. It is essential that a clear signal be sent in support of those who are in favour of the peaceful resolution of the situation in Ukraine based on the Geneva document and the Minsk agreements. I will not comment on the statement made by the representative of Ukraine in all its details because we have already heard, in 24 previous meetings, the same politicized, often anti-Russian statements. But I will just focus on three aspects of his statement and the statements of several other colleagues. First, I believe that it is inappropriate to bring to the Security Council discussions that are ongoing in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), particularly in regard to the implementation of the provisions of the Minsk agreements regarding border monitoring. Since there have been accusations against Russia in that context, I would just like to recall that the proposal to deploy OSCE observers at certain border crossing points was made by the Russian side in the context of the ceasefire. The ceasefire did not take place. However, we went even further. We said that, even in the absence of a ceasefire, we would be ready to deploy the observers on the Russian side of the Russian-Ukrainian border. That was a significant gesture by the Russian Federation, and any criticism in that regard is unacceptable. With regard to the issues being discussed by the OSCE in Vienna, I would like to recall that, as I noted in my statement, the Minsk protocol presupposes a certain sequence of steps that needs to be followed. The sequence is first and foremost based on the implementation of the ceasefire, which unfortunately did not take place. The Ukrainian representative made a very important appeal for an end to the shelling of areas where civilians live. Why does he not direct his appeal to his own side? He mentioned the insurgents. He asserted that civilians are dying as a result of such shelling. If that is the case, that is of course very unfortunate. However, civilians, sometimes as many as 19 people in one day, are dying in the Donbas region as a result of shells being fired by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. We note an interesting use of terms. The representative of Ukraine says that its armed forces are not responsible, but what about the battalions under Ukrainian command? It seems that they are under such command but the impression is that they are not. Once again, our Ukrainian colleague could do no better than give an unverified version of events, according to which a separatist missile shot down the Malaysian Airlines flight. I want to reiterate that it is irresponsible to voice unverified accounts in the Security Council. In that context, I have two questions: how and why did that happen? I will explain. Everyone now knows that as soon as the tragedy occurred, rumours were circulated in Kyiv. False information that was supposed to affirm a particular version of events was given. Why was that done? Because if one has information, why not share it? Why keep it secret? That is just a very simple explanation. In the preliminary report that they provided to us, the Dutch experts said that the air traffic control recordings were routine and contained nothing of value. If they are routine, why not publish them just to demonstrate transparency? What is more serious is the fact that our experts have drawn up some 40 important questions that need to be answered in order to understand what happened. The Ukrainian representative has made no attempt to reply to a single one of those questions. It is time for him to cease — in particular at Security Council meetings — his endless repetitions of unverified versions of events and to answer those questions. We would then be able to have a serious discussion. Otherwise, let us wait and try to conduct the investigation as seriously as possible, as we proposed on 19 September (see S/PV.7269). I would ask our Ukrainian colleague to reread the text of my statement today, as well as the recent statements issued today by President Vladimir Putin in Sochi and by Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov, which clearly outline our position with regard to the peace settlement and the Minsk process. My statement is in Russian. I will give the Council the text; there is no official English translation, but I think it will be useful. In connection with what our Australian colleague said, I do not think we need to have a broad discussion on the independent investigation, but I am very happy that he sounded so constructive about the investigation. I was concerned about one thing, however, on which I think we need to be very clear. The Australian Permanent Representative stated that the version referred to today is supposedly generally accepted or that it might be the version resulting from such an investigation. That simply is not the case. It was just a version constructed by the United States, which did not provide any justification. That version simply stated that a missile was fired from the region that was supposedly under the control of the separatists. We have not heard any proof. Yet a few days after the tragedy, that same region was visited by a journalist from the Russian Service of the BBC, who gave a four-minute report from there, which clearly demonstrated that no one had shot any missiles from that location. However, that report was posted on the BBC website for only half a day and was then taken down. I suppose it was not considered interesting enough to remain. I would like to reiterate a most important point. We should not exchange views, here in the Security Council Chamber, on versions of what happened. We should wait until the investigation is complete. We should ensure that the independent investigation is substantive and wait to see how the investigative team continues to work and what kind of report it produces. ","The United Kingdom requested this morning’s briefing because we remain deeply concerned about the situation in Ukraine. The illegal annexation of Crimea, the dire human rights situation there and in the east of Ukraine and Russia’s failure to implement its commitments under the Minsk agreements leave us in no doubt that the situation continues to present a clear threat to international peace and security. I am grateful for Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović’s briefing. The United Kingdom welcomes the work of the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, whose objective and impartial reporting cuts through Russia’s misinformation and propaganda. Its sixth report lays bare the grim reality of life in separatist-controlled areas in Donetsk and Luhansk, where “armed groups continued to terrorize the population” and “there is a complete breakdown of law and order”. In those areas, killings, abductions, torture and other serious human rights abuses carry on unchecked, and neither protection nor justice is available to victims. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is rightly concerned about a lack of accountability. It is essential that independent investigations take place into all serious allegations of violations, whoever the perpetrators are. We are troubled by the Human Rights Watch report this week, which alleges the use of cluster munitions by the Ukrainian army. We are aware that Ukraine refutes those allegations and denies that the Ukrainian army uses such munitions. We also note that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has said today that its monitors have seen no evidence of cluster bombs, and we welcome Ukraine’s commitment to cooperating with Human Rights Watch and to a further investigation into those claims. We are deeply perturbed by the OHCHR report’s account of a deteriorating human rights situation in the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula. The introduction of Russian Federation legislation, in contravention of General Assembly resolution 68/262, has curtailed the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, association, religion and belief. The treatment of the Crimean Tatar population is particularly troubling. Russia has often claimed to have concerns about the rights of minority populations in Ukraine, but we see no evidence of that concern for the rights of the Tatars in Crimea. The humanitarian situation in the areas controlled by the armed separatist groups remain precarious and will become even more serious as winter approaches. But the sending of convoys into Ukraine by Russia without the agreement of the Government of Ukraine and in breach of Ukraine’s sovereignty is a provocative act and must not be repeated. Humanitarian assistance is necessary, but it must be provided in an international effort coordinated by the appropriate agencies and with the agreement of the Government of Ukraine. If Russia wants to help improve the lives of civilians living in east Ukraine, it should immediately withdraw its remaining military forces from Ukraine, stop its flow of weapons to the separatists and instead help to restore Ukrainian sovereignty and to secure a political solution to the crisis. Assistant Secretary-General Fernandez-Taranco’s briefing described the fragility of the situation in eastern Ukraine where fighting continues and violations of the ceasefire continue on a daily basis. The Minsk agreements offer a real prospect of de-escalating tensions in eastern Ukraine. All parties must match words with actions and implement the commitments they have made. The Government of Ukraine has taken important steps, including the approval of a special status for districts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and an amnesty law which, the OHCHR report notes, meets international human rights standards. And the Government is now preparing for local elections to be held under Ukrainian law in separatist-controlled areas of Luhansk and Donetsk. Russia, by contrast, continues to supply separatists with weapons and material, including multiple rocket launchers and artillery, continues to maintain several hundred of its forces in Ukrainian territory and, in yet another ominous reminder of the tactics it used to shape the frozen conflicts in Moldova and Georgia, is handing out passports to individuals in separatist-held areas. As the Minsk agreements make clear, in order for the situation in eastern Ukraine to stabilize, it is vital that all illegally armed groups, military equipment, fighters and mercenaries be withdrawn and the Ukrainian- Russian border secured with increased monitoring under OSCE verification. If Russia is committed to those agreements, then why on Wednesday of this week, in Vienna, did it block the expansion of the OSCE border-monitoring mission? That violates article 4 of the Minsk protocol and demonstrates that Russia is seeking to prevent effective monitoring of its border so that it may continue to supply weapons and equipment to militant groups. Stability will not be restored if Russia continues to support separatist groups whose leaders have expressed their intentions to expand the territory under their control. This Sunday’s parliamentary elections mark Ukraine’s commitment to democracy. They must be allowed to go ahead without external influence. The Ukrainian authorities are taking steps to ensure that as many Ukrainian citizens as possible can exercise their right to vote, including by putting in place arrangements for people displaced from their homes by the instability in the east and those from the illegally annexed territory of Crimea. Our expectation is that Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council and as a party to the Minsk agreements, will work to restore peace and security in Ukraine by respecting the outcome of the elections and by supporting the forthcoming local elections held under Ukrainian law. We urge the Russians not to renege on the commitments they have made, but rather to use their influence to prevent the organization of any separate elections by separatists in Donetsk or Luhansk in November. Such elections would be illegal, would contravene the Minsk agreements, and would present a significant obstacle to a lasting peace in Ukraine ","I thank Assistant Secretaries-General Oscar Fernandez- Taranco and Ivan Šimonović for their briefings. The United States has always been and remains steadfastly committed to finding a peaceful solution to the crisis in Ukraine. Peace requires respect — respect for international law, respect for borders, respect for other nations’ sovereignty. It requires living up to one’s commitments and owning up to one’s actions. Yet, over the course of our 25 meetings in the Security Council on Ukraine, that has proved an overwhelming challenge for Russia. Russia continues to provide separatists with resources, arms and training, all the while continuing to deny it is doing so. Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko was seized by separatists in Ukraine and somehow ended up unlawfully transferred to Russia, where she is now being forced to undergo what is termed “psychiatric evaluation”, in which her human rights are violated through the use of a practice made infamous in the Soviet Union. We have seen reports of other Ukrainians similarly detained in Russia, with similar disregard for international standards. Those actions must stop. There is one clear path to recovering peace in Ukraine. All sides, including Russia and the separatists it supports, must honour the commitments they agreed to on 5 September in Minsk. Those commitments include an immediate end to ceasefire violations, restoration of Ukrainian control of its side of the international border, monitoring of the border by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and a security zone on either side of the border, withdrawal of foreign forces, mercenaries and equipment from Ukraine, and the release of hostages and prisoners. All sides agreed to 12 commitments on 5 September, and the Ukrainians have taken action on all those for which they have a responsibility. Unfortunately, both the separatists supported by the Russian Federation and Russia itself have failed to implement their Minsk commitments. In response to the Ukrainian laws on special status that provide additional autonomy for parts of Donetsk and Luhansk, including special elections to be held on 7 December, the separatists have declared unilaterally that they would hold their own local so-called elections in November. That is unconstitutional and completely inconsistent with the Minsk agreements. It also reveals the separatists’ true intentions, which are not to empower people with a choice within the legal political process of Ukraine, but rather to set up another vote that they can once again rig. Continued separatist assaults in locations throughout Donetsk and Luhansk, including in and around the airport, have resulted in the killing and wounding of scores of Ukrainian armed forces and civilians, and the destruction of vital infrastructure. Those attacks have occurred since the agreement in Minsk and after the ceasefire went into effect. The failure to live up to the ceasefire is only imposing greater hardship and suffering on the people of the Donbas region. They are the ones being forced to live with no water or electricity and no opportunity to earn a living, and their children are the ones whose schools are in the crossfire. That is not how anyone should live. The people of Ukraine will celebrate a milestone on Sunday as they go to the polls to elect a new parliament, demonstrating their commitment to an enduring democratic process, despite the political upheaval during the past year. We hope to see wide participation in the elections by all Ukrainians, including in Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk, and strongly condemn any interference in that legitimate democratic process. While Ukraine seeks to build a peaceful, stable and secure future, Russia continues to occupy Ukraine. Following its attempted annexation of Crimea, Russia’s representative pledged that the Council “has no need to worry about the fate of the Crimean Tatars” (S/PV.7157, p. 21). Yet we see report after report documenting abuses, including detentions, expulsions, restrictions of movement and the curtailment of the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, association and religion or belief. The Russian occupation of Crimea must end, and until it does the Russian occupying authorities must cease their harassment of religious and ethnic minorities and allow international human rights monitors and monitors from the OSCE full access to Crimea. In Crimea, we have seen how a group of separatists who seized power on the pretext of protecting one minority have become the cruel oppressors of another. We should expect nothing different from the separatists trying to seize control in eastern Ukraine. We welcome Ukraine’s commitment to investigating the allegations of mass graves, and we note that in July, with the assistance of international experts, Ukraine began an investigation into grave sites containing eight bodies that were discovered in Sloviansk following the town’s liberation from separatist control. No one is above the law, and the United States supports a full, thorough and impartial investigation of all alleged grave sites. Full implementation of the Minsk agreement would, of course, create an environment that would enable those investigations to move forward. We are also aware of reporting by non-governmental organizations on the use of cluster munitions. We take note of the Ukrainian Government’s denial of the use of such weapons. We take very seriously all accusations regarding harm to civilians and unequivocally condemn any indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas. There can be no excuse for abuses committed by anyone fighting in eastern Ukraine, and all such accusations should be fully investigated as soon as the security conditions allow. That, of course, means that the separatists and their Russian backers must cooperate. There has been much focus in recent days on the lines demarcating the ceasefire, but let us not forget a more important line, the international border. Indeed, in the Minsk agreement of 5 September, point number 4 of the 12 calls for permanent monitoring of the Ukrainian-Russian State border and verification of it by the OSCE. The Government of Ukraine recently submitted a plan to provide for that monitoring, restore Ukrainian control on its side of the border, prevent the illegal movement of personnel and matériel across the border and create a security zone free of weapons in the areas adjacent to the border in Ukraine and the Russian Federation. But Russia has not engaged on this plan, neither have the separatists, and Russia has refused to expand OSCE monitoring along the border. Until a full monitoring mission is in place on the international border, supplies and equipment will continue to flow from Russia to the separatists, and separatists will continue to cross back and forth at will. President Putin said in Milan that he would not discuss OSCE monitoring of the border until the residents of the Donbas are secure. In fact, the reverse is true. The residents of Donbas will not be secure until the OSCE is monitoring the border. Ukraine’s sovereignty must be restored over the entirety of its border with Russia. If the border can be secured and if free and fair elections can be held — not only on 26 October across Ukraine for the Rada, but also on 7 December in the areas of Donetsk and Luhansk — everybody will benefit, as will the cause of peace and security. Russia’s actions over the past months have challenged the most basic principles of our international system. Borders cannot and should not be redrawn at the barrel of a gun or on the whim of a single leader and the circle of his cronies around him. We have identified a path to peace. That path has been agreed to by the parties in Minsk. It has concrete, verifiable commitments, and all must be implemented. Ukraine has taken real steps to fulfil its commitments, while Russia and the separatist it backs have not. We call on them to act immediately to implement the obligations they undertook, and we call on them to do so now. ",,,,,,,,,,,"I thank you for convening this important meeting, Madam President. I would also like to thank Assistant Secretary-General Fernandez-Taranco and Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for their briefings today.
We continue to welcome the reports of the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine and the assistance of the United Nations. We are fully committed to protecting and promoting the human rights of all Ukrainian citizens, including those who live in the temporarily occupied Ukrainian territory of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol. We have taken careful note of the issues raised by Mr Šimonović in the Monitoring Mission’s latest report and will continue to work closely with his team.
In order to ensure the proper protection of civil rights and to eliminate the remnants of the totalitarian economy and the injustices of Yanukovych’s rule, Ukraine needs comprehensive reforms. To that end, President Poroshenko has launched a reform strategy for 2020. Its eight priority areas are reform of the judiciary and the fight against corruption, reform of law enforcement bodies, deregulation and development of entrepreneurship, tax reform, decentralization of power and good governance, security and defence-sector reform, and health-care reform. Last week Parliament passed a package of anti-corruption measures and legislation aimed at strengthening the rule of law. The President also signed a decree initiating work on developing a national human rights strategy. The reforms were drafted in close cooperation with civil society and are public-inspired and people-oriented. Further measures will follow.
But even as we work to build a better future, we continue to make it absolutely clear that all crimes, particularly those relating to violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, must be fully investigated, and those responsible brought to justice. That applies to the killings in the Maidan in February as much as it does to the tragedy in Odessa on 2 May. The first cases connected to those tragic events are already before the courts. Last week, Human Rights Watch published a report suggesting that the Ukrainian armed forces may have used cluster munitions in Donetsk. Our forces have never used cluster munitions or any other prohibited weapons. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) confirmed on Wednesday that there is no evidence that Ukrainian forces have used such weapons, but we have nothing to hide and are ready for an open and transparent investigation.
The latest report of the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission presents further details of the appalling human-rights situation in the areas under militant control in eastern Ukraine. It highlights the role of foreign militants, particularly those from the Russian Federation, and the continuing grave human-rights violations committed by illegal armed groups. As the report makes clear, those groups are terrorizing Ukrainian citizens in the areas under their control. They resort to daily acts of abuse, including torture, killings and kidnappings. The report details, for example, the introduction of a criminal code, based on that of the Russian Federation, providing for the establishment of military tribunals and the use of the death penalty. We utterly condemn such violations of basic human rights. These are Ukrainians, and their rights are being abused by the militant groups who claim to be protecting them.
The latest report also draws attention to cases of Ukrainian citizens’ capture and subsequent illegal transfer to Russia. One such is the case of a Ukrainian servicewoman, Nadiya Savchenko, who was kidnapped in July on Ukrainian territory by Russian security services and is currently being kept under illegal arrest in Russia. The Russian law-enforcement agencies and courts have handled her case in a very untransparent way, with numerous violations of her rights. The Ukrainian film director Oleg Sentsov is also being illegally held captive. Russia refuses to grant Ukrainian consular access to Mr. Sentsov because, since he is a resident of Crimea, they now falsely claim, without his permission, that he is a Russian citizen, in a grave violation of his rights as a citizen of Ukraine, as well as contrary to Ukrainian legislation and internationally recognized legal standards. Moreover, according to information the Government of Ukraine has received, both captives have been ill treated in Russian prisons.
We continue to be gravely concerned about the massive and systematic violations of human rights in illegally occupied Crimea. In complete violation of international law, Russia has forcibly imposed its national legislation there. Occupation authorities have also encouraged criminal acts against Crimean Tatars and others belonging to national minorities and religious groups. The Russian authorities have refused to facilitate proper investigations or even to comment on the killings and abductions of pro-Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar activists, who include Reshat Ametov, Tymur Shaymardanov, Seyran Zinedine, Leonid Korzh and Vasyl Chernysh. They have prevented the Tatar leaders Mustafa Jemilev and Rifat Chubarov from travelling to the Crimean peninsula, their historical native land.
Illegal detentions, torture, property searches, confiscations, and pressures on business and social activity groups have become daily realities for the residents of Crimea. We demand that Russia, as the temporary occupier of Crimea, stop violating the rights of our citizens. At a minimum the situation there must be internationally monitored on a constant basis. We welcome the continuing commitment of the United Nations to ensuring that those suffering in Crimea are not forgotten.
As President Poroshenko has repeatedly stated, Ukraine is fully committed to a peaceful settlement of the situation in the east of our country. That situation was not of our making, but we are striving to end the bloodshed. Our commitment to finding a peaceful solution resulted in the signing of the Minsk protocol and the Minsk memorandum amoong Ukraine, the OSCE and the Russian Federation, with the participation of representatives of militant groups.
Immediately after the signing of the Minsk protocol, the Ukrainian Government moved quickly to implement the agreement. Our Parliament adopted a law on interim local self-government in certain districts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and set the date for local elections. It also adopted a law granting amnesty to those involved in the recent unrest. We entered into talks regarding hostage exchanges, resulting in over 1,000 people being freed. We continued to provide humanitarian relief, working in close partnership with United Nations agencies and other international organizations, and the new law, adopted on Monday, on the temporary status of internally displaced persons will further facilitate our humanitarian efforts. We prepared a plan for economic renewal and growth, including plans for the economic revival of the Donbas region, and have called for a donor conference later this year. We have rendered all possible assistance to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in order to create conditions for its experts to verify the ceasefire.
We fully support current efforts to step up those monitoring efforts, as demanded under articles 2 and 4 of the Minsk protocol, particularly along the Ukrainian-Russian border. At present, only two border crossings are monitored by the OSCE. That is clearly insufficient. Unfortunately, on Wednesday, our proposal to expand the monitoring of the border was blocked by the Russian Federation in the OSCE. It is of grave concern that, despite being a signatory to the agreement, Russia refuses to undertake tangible steps to implement it. It is clear that that is simply a cynical attempt to maintain the daily flows of arms, weaponry and militants from Russia to Ukraine.
We have strictly observed the ceasefire regime, the details of which are specified in the Minsk memorandum. Since its signature, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have not undertaken offensive operations and have used their weapons only to defend themselves. Regrettably, our goodwill has not been reciprocated. Militant leaders have openly stated their intentions to violate the terms of the ceasefire and their aim of capturing new territories, including the cities of Mariupol and Sloviansk. Fierce fighting has been occurring around Donetsk airport and the outskirts of the towns of Debaltseve and Shchastya, where the militants are trying to extend the area under their control.
It is a tragedy that Ukrainian citizens continue to lose their lives. Since the truce started, the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been shelled over two thousand times. As a result of those attacks, 89 Ukrainian servicemen have been killed and 500 wounded. At least 54 Ukrainian civilians have been killed as a result of separatist shelling, including 7 killed by separatist rocket fire near the village of Sartana last week.
If the Minsk agreements are to succeed, all parties must live up to one hundred per cent of their commitments. The militants, together with Russian troops that continue to remain on our soil, must cease their offensive military actions and end the shelling of civilian areas. A11 foreign military personnel must leave the territory of Ukraine. The Russian Federation must cease its illegal supplies of weapons and equipment, limit the flow of so-called volunteers across our sovereign border and allow us to re-establish proper controls.
Unfortunately, what we are now seeing is the continuation of a military build-up by Russia along our border and in north Crimea. The illegal militant groups have been able to strengthen their military capabilities and are now threatening to seize other cities of Ukraine by further offensive military actions. In making those calls, we are simply urging Russia and its pro-Russian separatist allies to live up to the agreements they freely entered into. In particular, we warn them to refrain from any provocations aimed at disrupting the coming elections.
This Sunday, national parliamentary elections will be held across Ukraine. Local elections in the Donbas region envisaged by the Minsk protocol are scheduled for December The leadership of Ukraine will do its utmost to ensure their fair and transparent conduct, in full compliance with international democratic standards and the legislation of Ukraine. Both those votes are an integral part of the peace process and are vital for an inclusive dialogue at the national level. They will identify parliamentary representatives from all regions of Ukraine and legitimate local representatives in the Donbas.
As of today, due to the security situation in the east, parliamentary elections can be held in 11 of 21 constituencies of the Donetsk region and in 4 of 11 constituencies of the Luhansk region. But it is important that everyone’s voice is heard. Therefore, we urge that free and secure access to polling stations be granted to those Ukrainian citizens who reside in the areas that remain under militant control. We call on Russia to unequivocally condemn the attempts by the illegal armed groups to hold their own local elections on 2 November. Moscow must make clear to the militant authorities that that effort will hinder the peace process and that the results of that illegal vote, organized in violation of Ukrainian legislation, will never be recognized.
Since the beginning of this year, Ukraine has suffered immense upheaval. Our territory has been illegally occupied and our borders violated. In pursuit of its own narrow self-interests, Russia has instigated a brutal insurgency in the Donbas region that has led to the loss of numerous lives, including the passengers of Flight MH-17, shot down by a separatist missile. International law has been trampled and the human rights of Ukrainian citizens abused.
In this difficult time we are grateful for the support shown by the United Nations, members of this Council, the European Union and the members of international community who have stood up for the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of this Organization. But the crisis in our country is not yet over. We need he Council’s help now more than ever to bring an end to the violence. In September we engaged in arrangements with the hope of ending the bloodshed and ensuring sustainable peace. To fulfil that goal the terms of the agreement must be implemented in full by all involved in the trilateral dialogue. We urge the Council to hold all signatories to their commitments.I would first like to say that the independent investigation into the Flight MH-17 aircrash is being undertaken by the Netherlands and competent authorities and that the investigation includes an international team. My Government is also participating in that task. It is fully committed to the work being undertaken within that group.
As for the other allegations voiced by the Russian delegation, I regret that it continues to use such unconstructive rhetoric. I just want to reiterate our main message regarding the accusations levelled at the Government of Ukraine that our troops committed some crimes. We take very seriously all credible information about any crimes committed on the territory of Ukraine. The Government of Ukraine condemns all crimes, especially serious crimes in breach of international law. Any such crimes should be properly investigated. They will be investigated and those responsible will be held accountable sooner or later. Ukraine is open to cooperating with international partners in the investigation of such crimes.
I hope that that position is quite clear. However, at the same time, it seems to me that Russia is casting such unfounded allegations against Ukraine in order to distract the attention of the international community from the main issue, which is the Russsian aggression against Ukraine and its interference into the domestic affairs of my country. The occupation of Crimea, the instigation of unrest in eastern Ukraine and the supply of weapons and manpower for the needs of the separatist movements in Ukraine are among the main causes of those dramatic events.
Unfortunately, I have not heard from the Russian delegation a firm willingness to comply strictly with the Minsk arrangements, to which it is a party. We have not heard any expression of Russia’s firm intention to withdraw its troops from Ukraine or its readiness to cooperate with Ukraine in establishing effective control over the State border. We have not heard a condemnation of the serious crimes committed by the illegal armed groups, crimes that are clearly reflected in the United Nations Monitoring Mission’s report.
We also had expected that Russia would condemn the intentions of the separatists to hold local elections on 2 November, an act that would violate the Minsk arrangements, signed by Ukraine and Russia. It would be quite difficult to settle the situation in eastern Ukraine without addressing that issue, as noted in our statement today. The leadership of Ukraine has demonstrated by its deeds its readiness and willingness to work for a peaceful resolution. It is time for the other parties to step up and show their sincere will to engage in dialogue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I would like to thank Assistant Secretaries-General Oscar Fernandez-Taranco and Ivan Šimonović for their briefings. We thank the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine for its work and look forward to its continued reporting. The monitoring missions of the United Nations and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) must be provided with full, free and unrestricted access to the whole territory of Ukraine, including Crimea.
Since we last met on the situation in Ukraine (see S/PV.7253), a ceasefire has come into effect, or rather a “fire and cease”, in the interpretation of separatists. During this period, Ukrainian forces and civilians have been shelled some 2,000 times, some 90 Ukrainian servicemen have been killed and 500 have been wounded. The self-proclaimed Premier of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, Zakharchenko, claims that all of the Donetsk region is theirs, and that they could take the towns of Berdiansk and Izium, among others.
Russian soldiers continue to die on Ukrainian soil — soldiers who allegedly are not even there. Yelena Vasilyeva, the head of a Russian women’s group, Cargo 200 from Ukraine to Russia, says that some 4,000 Russian soldiers have lost their lives in Ukraine.
The self-appointed separatist chieftains in eastern Ukraine — pawns in the Kremlin’s dangerous Novorossia plan of redrawing Europe’s borders — are wasting no time in causing to erode what was achieved in Minsk. Relentless attacks by illegal armed groups on Donetsk airport are a daily reality. The latest reports of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission speak of the attempts by separatist armed groups to seize strategic targets. Sophisticated Russian military equipment, multiple rocket launchers, tanks and ammunition continue to cause death and destruction on Ukraine’s soil, and the border remains wide open for the comings and goings of men in military fatigues and Cossack uniforms.
As a matter of fact, only one kilometre of the entire 400-kilometre segment of the border, currently out of Ukraine’s control, is being monitored by the OSCE. At a meeting of the OSCE Permanent Council on 22 October, Russia single-handedly blocked the extension of the OSCE Observer Mission’s activities along the entire border. “We control the border and we will not let Ukrainian border guards return there. We do not need any international mediators on the border, either”, says Andrei Purgin, self-proclaimed First Deputy Prime Minister of the Donetsk People’s Republic, according to Interfax. Indeed, why should they need an international presence that could witness illegal flows of military supplies and foreign fighters or register the fact that Ukraine’s coal and equipment are being smuggled out of the country, causing Ukraine considerable economic and financial damage?
Let us not forget that in August and September, Russia sent three unchecked humanitarian aid convoys into Ukraine in clear breach of Ukraine’s sovereignty, without inspection by the Ukrainian authorities and without coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross. Notably, immediately after the entry of those mystery convoys, the rebels were quick to regain ground and reverse Ukraine’s successes in clearing the area of illegal armed groups.
As Ukraine prepares for the critical national elections on 26 October, the separatists are planning an election of their own on 2 November — another sham, illegal and illegitimate election, another cynical and blatant breach of the Minsk agreements. Russia, so quick to make accusations against Ukraine, including long-debunked ones, has not spoken even once against the multiple violations of the ceasefire by the illegal militants who continue to enjoy its full support.
The human rights situation in the areas controlled by Russian-backed armed groups remains of most serious concern. Extrajudicial killings, torture, intimidation, public humiliation, ill-treatment, extortion, abductions for ransom, and forced labour remain the trademarks of the pro-Russian militants in eastern Ukraine. As the latest report of the monitoring group indicates, violence against women in separatist-held areas, including rape, has reached disturbing proportions. Information on child soldiers among the militant separatists and military schools for children points to violations of international humanitarian law.
The situation of the indigenous Tatar community in Russia-occupied Crimea continues to deteriorate. Reported cases of kidnapping, torture and killing of young male Crimean Tatars, their persecution and eviction from the Mejlis in Simferopol, and interrogations of the community’s activists continue unabated. Yet once again, in spite of the multiple atrocities committed by the illegal separatist groups, we have yet to hear a single condemnation of those crimes by Russia. It is quite ironic that Russia, which has consistently ignored Human Rights Watch reports on such abuses, including on enforced disappearances in the Crimea, should now widely quote a Human Rights Watch report on the alleged use of cluster bombs in Ukraine. While Ukraine has denied their use, its joining the Oslo Convention would be the best antidote to any further speculations to that effect, and we urge Ukraine to do so.
Contrary to Russia’s claims, Ukraine is demonstrating its commitment to implementing the Minsk agreements. Life is slowly returning to normal in areas freed from the illegal insurgents. Important legislation has been adopted, as noted by Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović. On 18 October, the law on the special status of Luhansk and Donetsk came into effect. We commend Ukraine’s commitment to pursuing the path of difficult but necessary reforms and strongly encourage the Government to continue the national dialogue and ensure full inclusion of all components of the population.
At the same time, we must stress that without Russia’s full cooperation and compliance, the Minsk agreements will be worth no more than the paper on which they are written. The only viable solution is one that fully respects Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity, including Crimea as an integral part of Ukraine. Russia must immediately withdraw all its armed formations, military equipment and fighters from the territory of Ukraine, stop supporting and arming the separatists, and unequivocally condemn the illegal elections planned by the separatist commandos. Permanent monitoring and verification on both sides of the Ukrainian-Russian border must be ensured. Russia should also stop escalating tensions in the wider region. The recently proposed draft agreement on alliance and integration between the Russian Federation and the surrogate republic of Abkhazia is nothing else than a de facto annexation of an integral part of Georgia.
With thousands of human lives lost and hundreds of thousands displaced, it is also essential to establish accountability for the human rights violations and abuses that have taken place during the war against Ukraine. Those who have committed serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law must be brought to account. In that respect, we encourage Ukraine to accede to the International Criminal Court Statute and accelerate its national efforts to pursue accountability. We also reiterate our position that those responsible for the downing of Flight MH-17, as well as those who have obstructed access to its crash site and interfered with the investigation, must be brought to account.","I thank the briefers for their briefings. Nigeria welcomes the efforts of European leaders towards resolving the crisis in eastern Ukraine. The recent meeting between President Putin and President Poroshenko during the Asia-Europe summit has opened a promising vista. We see such high-level engagements as providing a platform for exploring ways to end the instability and violence that have engulfed eastern Ukraine. We stress that a diplomatic solution is the only viable option for resolving the crisis in Ukraine.
The Minsk agreement is an encouraging development that provides an avenue for de-escalating tension in eastern Ukraine. We believe that if fully implemented, it could restore peace and stability in the region. We therefore strongly urge all parties to abide by their commitments under the provisions of the agreement.
Throughout our engagement on this issue, we have stressed adherence to the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations, namely, respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States. In that connection we condemn the plans by separatist forces to hold local elections in November. It is contrary to the spirit of the Minsk agreement and can further threaten the peace, unity and sovereignty of Ukraine. We appeal to Member States with influence over the separatists to prevail on them to drop their plans to hold the elections in the interest of peace and security in Ukraine.","I wish to thank the Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Fernandez-Taranco, and the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Mr. Šimonović, for their very comprehensive briefings the on recent events in Ukraine and the human rights situation.
Jordan has also taken note of the sixth report of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, issued by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. We express our regret over the non-compliance with the most important parts of the peace plan, namely, the complete cessation of hostilities and a halt to the confrontations between Ukrainian forces and the separatists, although the frequency of such confrontations has been reduced. There have been increasing numbers of crimes against citizens, including forced displacement, torture and forced labour, and the deprivation of the right of citizens to stability and security. Jordan is concerned at reports by human rights organizations on the use of cluster bombs in several attacks. That is a violation of the provisions of international law and a dangerous development that imperils the lives of citizens. In that framework, we call for an international independent inquiry, an objective inquiry, to investigate the use of such internationally prohibited weapons.
Jordan expresses its support for the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine and for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission. We support them because of their important role in monitoring events regularly and presenting periodic reports to the Council on the facts on the ground in Ukraine, especially in the eastern part of that country. We call on the Government of Ukraine and the separatists to facilitate the entry of those missions to all parts of the country in order to promote security and stability. We reiterate our full support for efforts to find a solution to the crisis through dialogue and diplomacy, and we reaffirm the need to protect citizens and respect the provisions of international law, human rights, international human rights law and to prevent elicit attacks against citizens, in contravention of human rights.
Putting an end to the conflict is a political responsibility and a moral responsibility for all those concerned. The Security Council must play its role and make every possible effort to facilitate a political solution with regard to Ukraine’s sovereignty and unity. We call on all parties to respect their commitments, the peace agreements and the Minsk memorandum, and to remain open to the various viewpoints in order to reach a lasting solution.
We welcome the positive measures taken by Ukraine: the adoption of the transitional status legislation, especially that giving special status to the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which have been autonomous for three years, as well as the preparations for the local elections to be held next January. We call on the Government of Ukraine to make greater efforts aimed at guaranteeing the freedom and equal rights of all citizens of Ukraine, including the members of minority groups. Political, social and cultural rights are all equally important for stability.
We hope that the parliamentary elections scheduled for 26 October will be organized in a climate of stability and confidence in order to facilitate the reform process and a return to the rule of law and democracy in Ukraine’s political life.","At the outset, we would like to thank Mr. Ivan Šimonović, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, for his briefing on the human rights situation in Ukraine and Mr. Oscar Fernandez-Taranco, Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs. We appreciate the efforts that they, together with the Secretary-General, are making in that country.
The report before us describes the human rights situation in eastern Ukraine in a worrying way. The dramatic increase in violations of the rights to life, liberty and security now affecting civilians in Donbas underscores the need to restore the rule of law and to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine in accordance with General Assembly resolution 68/262 and international law. The recent reports indicating the possible use of cluster bombs in eastern Ukraine are of particular concern. They must be investigated. If they are proved to be true, those responsible must be brought to justice. As we have pointed out in various forums, we condemn the use of such weapons. We call on those countries that have still not signed and ratified the Convention on Cluster Munitions to do so in the near future.
We reiterate that accountability for all human rights violations and abuses committed in Ukraine must be guaranteed. It is equally critical that the authorities conclude the investigation, that those responsible for the deaths of 48 people in Odessa on 2 May be brought to justice and that there be clarification as to why the security forces did not act in a timely and decisive way. We are also concerned about the human rights situation in Crimea, in particular with regard to discrimination against Ukrainian nationals and the Tatar minority.
On the humanitarian front, we are concerned about the situation of internally displaced persons in eastern Ukraine, who, according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, now total more than 400,000 people, mostly women and children — a clear sign of the severity of the crisis. In that regard, we commend the recent adoption by the Ukrainian Parliament of the law on the rights and freedoms of internally displaced persons on 20 October.
Ahead of the elections scheduled for this weekend, we would like to reiterate that an inclusive political process, based on dialogue, is essential to a stable and democratic future for all the Ukrainian people. To that end, we welcome the ongoing steps by the Ukrainian Government to implement the provisions of the Minsk protocol, in particular those relating to the ceasefire, the release of all prisoners, the withdrawal of armed groups and the disarmament of those groups.
Finally, along with the repeated call to urgently ensure full respect for the rule of law, democracy and human rights in Ukraine, including the rights of all minorities, we also reiterate our support for the work of the human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, together with the monitoring mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.","I would like to join others in thanking Mr. Oscar Fernandez-Taranco, Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, and Mr. Ivan Šimonović, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, for their briefings.
Chad continues to be gravely concerned by the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Ukraine, especially in the eastern part of the country. On the humanitarian level, Chad notes that despite the Minsk agreement of 5 September, which includes the ceasefire agreement, the use of heavy weapons and bombings in inhabited areas continue on a daily basis. We are all the more concerned because, according to certain sources, the Ukrainian army and separatist forces are using cluster bombs in their confrontations in eastern Ukraine. As the Council is aware, such weapons cause severe harm. Sometimes, when a bomb does not explode immediately, it becomes the equivalent of a mine. Chad emphatically condemns the use of those weapons of mass destruction in violation of international treaties and calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities.
On the humanitarian level, the figures demonstrate that civilian victims have increased sharply in this situation of intensified combat. According to the report of the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights, over 3,000 people have been killed to date and 9,000 have been injured in eastern Ukraine. Despite the truce of 7 September, another 350 people have been killed. As for the internally displaced persons, Ukraine has over 400,000.
It is a dire moment. The majority of the population in the conflict zones are facing substantial difficulties, with no access to education, sanitary facilities, shelter or work. Furthermore, with the advent of winter and the stalemate in the negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine on the provision of natural gas, we fear that millions of people will be subjected to an untenable situation. In the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, thousands of people have been deprived of income because nearly 40,000 small and medium-sized businesses have closed shop due to the fighting.
Moreover, war-related practices — torture, abduction, illegal detention, intimidation, confiscation of goods, summary and arbitrary execution and acts of sexual violence — are being committed against the civilian population by Government forces as well as by separatists, and are unacceptable. Chad condemns all acts of violence and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.
Given the scope of the conflict and despite the repeated calls of the international community and the Security Council, Chad believes that the situation is not simply fragile, as stated in the report; rather, we are on the verge of an acute humanitarian crisis. In view of the situation, Chad urges the parties to the conflict to exercise restraint and calm, and calls on the countries with influence over the actors on the ground to exert all efforts to find a political solution to the crisis, which has lasted too long.
Chad congratulates the Government of Ukraine on its peacemaking and peacebuilding efforts in Ukraine. First was the signing of the Minsk accord and memorandum under the auspices of the Trilateral Contact Group on 19 September. Then, on 16 September, the Ukrainian Parliament ratified the law on special autonomy for certain regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, the law on amnesty and the immediate release of all hostages and detained persons. Those efforts must continue. The elections scheduled for Sunday will be another key step of the will for peace in Ukraine.
The humanitarian situation requires responsibility on the part of the authorities and political actors. Lasting solutions must be provided to the affected population, making a priority of the structural issues affecting human rights, in conformity with international norms, the recommendations contained in the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the human rights situation in Ukraine, and in the framework of respect for General Assembly resolution 68/262, on Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.","I thank Assistant Secretary-General Fernandez-Taranco and Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for their briefings. Australia supports the ongoing work of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the human rights situation in Ukraine, which is so important to enabling the Council to assess developments in Ukraine, a task that is clearly needed by us. As we have seen, the sixth report of the human rights monitoring mission gives rise, yet again, to serious concerns.
There have been some encouraging developments in the reporting period and since then, particularly the ceasefire agreement and the Minsk protocol in early September, the restoration of law and order to some parts of eastern Ukraine, and the partial drawdown of some Russian military personnel and equipment from Ukrainian territory. But of grave concern are the continuing hostilities in parts of eastern Ukraine, which have led to well over 300 fatalities — both civilian and combatants — since the ceasefire began. The latest report details significant casualties, significant numbers of displaced people, the dreadful state of critical infrastructure and of thousands of children who are unable to access education. Australia calls for all parties to uphold the ceasefire and to engage in a genuine and constructive dialogue to find a political solution.
The report paints a very disturbing picture of life in the eastern Ukrainian territories occupied by armed groups. Yet again, we have another United Nations report that documents the breakdown in law and order in areas under separatist control. The reports of abductions for ransom and forced labour, torture and extrajuducial killings are all the hallmarks of criminality and illegitimacy. The killing of a staff member of the International Committee of the Red Cross by shelling in Donetsk is deplorable and highlights once again the need for all parties to respect international humanitarian law. Any violations of international humanitarian law by any party to the conflict must be properly investigated and the perpetrators held accountable.
Upholding the ceasefire is clearly an important enabling step towards a political solution, but so, too, is the preservation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We are troubled by credible reports, including from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), of significant numbers of foreign fighters continuing to move across the Russian border into Ukraine and of large-scale attacks against Ukrainian border checkpoints. That must stop. The Ukrainian-Russian border must be secured, ideally with permanent monitoring under expanded OSCE verification. It is disturbing that Russia has blocked that.
We note the reports of the possible use of banned munitions and of indiscriminate shelling. We also note that the Government of Ukraine has denied having had a role in any such abuses. Clearly, the facts should be established. If there are such abuses, they should cease. We also note that the ongoing violation of the ceasefire prevents the resettlement of the many thousands of internally displaced persons that the conflict has generated. As Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović has emphasized this morning, that is particularly worrying given the onset of winter.
Ukraine will hold parliamentary elections in two days’ time. Ukrainians have the right for those elections to be free, fair and transparent. Clearly, they should be held without external interference. They must take place in a secure environment that protects freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and association within Ukraine’s legislative framework.
Announcements by the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics that they intend to hold separate elections in November contravene both the letter and the spirit of the Minsk protocol and undermine efforts towards finding a sustainable political solution within Ukraine’s legislative framework. Those purported elections can have no legitimacy. As the report notes, the parallel governance structures being created in Donetsk and Luhansk do not comply with international norms and standards or, of course, with Ukraine’s Constitution.
The report again draws the Council’s attention to disturbing, multiple and ongoing human rights violations in the illegally annexed territory of Crimea, including the imposition of Russian laws that restrict the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, association and religion. The persecution and intimidation of Crimea’s Tatar population is unacceptable.
The international dimensions of the conflict in Ukraine are known to us all, including the families in Australia still grieving the loss of their loved ones on Flight MH-17. All available information, including the independent preliminary investigation report of the Dutch Safety Board, is consistent with the assessment that Flight MH-17 was shot down by a surface-to-air missile fired from a location under the control of Russian-backed separatists. Australia, along with our Dutch and Malaysian partners, remains committed to returning to the crash site when conditions are safe to do so and to doing all that it can to bring to justice those responsible for the downing of Flight MH-17 and the murder of all those on board.
To conclude, we must not overlook the root cause of the situation in eastern Ukraine: Russia’s persistent campaign of deliberate destabilization. However, there is a clear path towards an end to the violence in eastern Ukraine. Russia must withdraw all its support to separatists, remove all its military forces and assets from Ukrainian territory, respect Ukraine’s borders, observe its obligations under the Minsk agreements and engage in genuine dialogue with Ukraine. Russia’s continued refusal to heed the international community’s call to de-escalate this crisis can lead only to Russia’s further isolation. I will be extremely brief. I would like to agree with my Russian colleague on the importance of answering all questions that need to be answered in respect of the independent investigation that is currently under way with regard to Flight MH-17. That investigation is independent. It is being undertaken by an independent body — the Dutch Safety Board. Participation in that investigation includes two Russian experts. As we understand it, all the questions that have been raised are being systematically looked at.
Our Australian experts are, of course, participating in that investigation, but I, as a member of the Australian Government, do not have access to the nature or detail of that participation. It is an independent investigation that has drawn up one preliminary report so far but which continues. All participating Governments and other bodies, including the International Civil Aviation Organization, have been assured that it will be very proper and very systematic and will answer all the questions that have been raised.
I therefore agree with my Russian colleague that such kinds of questions need to be looked at. Our understanding is that that is being done. But the fact is that we have an independent investigation. It enjoys the participation of all those who need to be involved, including Russian experts, and is being undertaken in accordance with accepted international guidelines, as affirmed to us in the briefing by Mr. Feltman that took place on 19 September (see S/PV.7269).
In terms of what I said in my earlier statement about the cause of the downing of the aircraft, what I said was that all the apparent evidence that has been produced so far, while not conclusive, is consistent with the initial assessment that that event, that atrocity, was consistent with a surface-to-air missile from the areas and in the terms that I mentioned. I did not assert that that was a definitive conclusion — certainly not yet — of the independent investigation, which is still looking to establish what happened rather than who was responsible.
The prosecutorial investigations that are under way and that involve hundreds and hundreds of prosecutors from 13 countries, who are being coordinated by the Dutch Government, will seek to establish the culpability and then lay the basis for accountability. Those countries most directly affected that lost citizens in that outrage have all indicated consistently their confidence in both processes that are taking place. I have said enough but I just wanted to put that firmly on the record.",,,,"Madam President, I would like to thank you for convening this meeting. I would also like to thank Mr. Oscar Fernandez-Taranco, Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, and Mr. Ivan Šimonović, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, for their respective briefings on the political and human rights situation in Ukraine.
The Security Council has been preoccupied with the conflict in Ukraine since February. In the intervening months more than 3,700 people have been killed, more than 9,000 civilians have been wounded and more than 824,000 Ukrainians have been driven from their homes. There are over 430,000 internally displaced persons. The position of Rwanda is clear and constant; it revolves around three key principles. The first is putting a stop to the hostilities and ensuring respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. The second is promoting genuine dialogue among Ukrainians, fostering national reconciliation, establishing self-governance and promoting rights for minorities. And the third is securing a diplomatic settlement to the crisis, involving the countries and organizations of the region.
It is in that context that Rwanda welcomes the signing of the 12-point Minsk protocol agreement on 5 September, which declared a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, as well as its implementation memorandum of 19 September under the auspices of the trilateral contact group. We note with satisfaction the steps already taken by President Petro Poroshenko and the Ukrainian Parliament to implement both agreements, namely the implementation of the ceasefire, the exchange of detainees and the adoption of laws on amnesty and self-governance. We believe that the parliamentary elections on Sunday will help implement those agreements, as they are critical to the consolidation of democracy and to diversity and the rule of law in Ukraine. We are, however, concerned by the inflammatory statements of armed separatists denouncing those elections, and we emphasize that only elections organized by the legitimate Government in Kyiv will be constitutional and in line with the Minsk agreements.
Although the ceasefire had for a while raised hopes for peace in Ukraine, we are perturbed by the statement of the Prime Minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic officially declaring the end of the ceasefire, in the wake of regular violations by armed parties. In that context, we reiterate our call on all illegal armed groups in Ukraine, mainly in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions to lay down their arms, and we urge the trilateral contact group to use its influence to ensure that the work of the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is not hindered and that the Minsk protocol is fully respected.
Rwanda is deeply troubled by the findings of the six-month report of the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. We condemn the continuing terror activities of armed groups in areas under their control, where they have perpetrated killings, abductions, torture, ill treatment and other serious human rights abuses, including the destruction of housing and seizure of property. We equally condemn the violations of international human rights law by some of the volunteer battalions under the control of the Government of Ukraine. Furthermore, we express our concern about the use of heavy weaponry and the indiscriminate shelling of densely populated areas, including through the reported use of cluster munitions. In the light of the response of the Ukrainian Government, which denied the use of illegal munitions, we hope that a full, thorough and independent investigation will be conducted to shed light on those allegations.
More generally, given the dark picture of the human rights situation in Ukraine, Rwanda urges all warring parties to comply with international humanitarian and human rights law. We welcome the commitment of the Ukrainian Government to investigate the reported human rights violations, including the reports of mass graves, and we stress that the perpetrators, including those who bear the command responsibility, should be held accountable.
Allow me to conclude by noting that, with the ongoing fighting, the fast-approaching winter season and the current gas shortage in Ukraine, the eastern part of the country is heading towards a humanitarian catastrophe. We therefore call on the political leaders in Ukraine, and those who have influence over them, to show leadership and a sense of responsibility by making sure that the ceasefire holds firm and by finding a lasting political and diplomatic solution to a crisis that has been going on for too long. ","I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Argentina.
Like my colleagues, I would like to thank the Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Oscar Fernandez-Taranco, and the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Mr. Ivan Šimonović, for their respective briefings on the situation in Ukraine.
Argentina expresses its concern about the continued deterioration of the security, human rights and humanitarian situation in Ukraine, especially in eastern Ukraine. We are also troubled by the effects of the resurgence of violence on the civilian population, which jeopardizes the efforts made to reach a diplomatic and political solution to the situation.
We are emphatic that no peaceful way out of the situation in Ukraine can be found through unilateral actions of any kind. It is imperative for all stakeholders to frame their actions strictly within international law and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We recall the obligation of all States, under the United Nations Charter, to settle their international disputes through peaceful means, in order not to endanger international peace and security.
We reiterate that the only possible solution is through dialogue and negotiation, with due respect for Ukraine’s management of its domestic affairs. Today, once again, Argentina calls for an end to confrontation and all forms of interference in internal affairs, which fall exclusively within the domestic jurisdiction of States, whether such interference is military, political, economic or rhetorical in nature.
For that reason, we believe that it is a positive step that the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine — comprising Ukraine, Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe — agreed to the protocol to implement President Poroshenko’s peace plan and President Putin’s initiatives, which were also signed by armed groups opposing the Government of Ukraine. However, we recognize that the fragility of the ceasefire is a true concern. After the recent meeting in Milan between the Presidents of Ukraine and Russia, we call for continued discussions in order to find a way out of the conflict and for all parties to implement the measures agreed upon in the protocol.
We are naturally deeply perturbed by the reports of the use of cluster bombs in densely populated areas. The parties must unreservedly respect human rights and international humanitarian law and must ensure accountability wherever violations of human rights and international humanitarian law occur. We deplore the reports of killings, kidnappings, abductions, torture, abuse and other serious violations of human rights, which are very worrying, but in the face of the evidence of such violations of human rights, we need truth, objective information, a speedy, reliable investigation and justice. With regard to the humanitarian situation, we would like to highlight the assistance being provided by the International Committee of the Red Cross and Médecins sans frontières. The international community should continue to support those efforts, and the parties should ensure that there is access for humanitarian aid.
Finally, as we have done every time the Security Council has dealt with this issue, Argentina would like to emphasize the Council’s primary responsibility for ensuring the maintenance of international peace and security, in accordance with the role assigned to it by the Charter of the United Nations. We deplore the fact that, despite the many times we have met to discuss the situation in Ukraine, the Council has not been able to play a positive role. As in other cases, constructive diplomacy has given way to politicization and personal attacks within the Council.
Once again, Argentina urges that we make a contribution rather than become an obstruction to bringing the parties together, so that they can find the common ground necessary to achieving a political and diplomatic solution and ending the confrontations that have had increasingly serious and severe effects on the civilian population. We cannot allow ourselves to be witnesses to further setbacks. Those of us with the greatest influence should contribute the most to constructive diplomacy. The international community must unite its efforts to help the parties find a peaceful solution to the complex situation in Ukraine.
I now resume my functions as President of the Council.
I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine.","I too would like to thank the Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Oscar Fernandez-Taranco, and the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Mr. Ivan Šimonović, for their briefings.
Luxembourg is deeply concerned by the human rights situation in eastern Ukraine, especially in the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, which are now outside the control of the Government of Ukraine. We condemn the many cases of killings, abductions, torture, mock executions, forced labour and forced recruitment, for which the armed separatist groups are responsible. The 16 September report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also mentions the adoption of an illegal criminal code re-establishing the death penalty for certain crimes, the confiscation of housing from people who have fled the conflict, and the public humiliation of political opponents and Ukrainian soldiers who have been taken prisoner. Those acts deserve our unanimous condemnation.
We also condemn the human rights violations committed by the battalions of volunteers working alongside the Ukrainian forces. We have become aware of the allegations regarding the use of cluster bombs by the parties to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has, however, not been able to confirm the truth of those allegations, and we note that Ukraine has denied that its forces have used such weapons. We welcome Ukraine’s willingness to cooperate with an impartial and independent investigation to shed light on those serious allegations, and we expect the separatists to do the same. The attacks on populated areas should be condemned and must stop.
Ukraine has the right and the obligation to defend its territory against the continuous and repeated violations of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. At the same time, it is essential for Ukraine to respect its international obligations and for its forces to always act in a proportionate and restrained manner. As the High Commissioner for Human Rights has said, with the increasing number of reports of serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights committed in the conflict zone, it is crucial to ensure accountability and the fight against impunity.
The situation in eastern Ukraine should not lead us to forget the problems that have persisted in Crimea since it was illegally annexed by Russia, in flagrant violation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and General Assembly resolution 68/262. The rights of minorities continue to be violated, especially those of the Crimean Tatars and the Ukrainian-speaking populations, the great majority of whom oppose the recent political changes. We are particularly concerned by the repeated intimidations targeting the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People and its members, Crimean Tatar activists and the journalists who cover those events.
We welcome the approval, in the context of the trilateral contact group, of the Minsk protocol of 5 September and the Minsk memorandum of 19 September, which represent a step towards a lasting political solution to the crisis. That solution must be based on respect for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. We note the decrease in the overall level of violence following the ceasefire agreement. However, the ceasefire continues to be repeatedly violated, particularly by the separatists, which we strongly condemn.
Luxembourg welcomes Ukraine’s efforts to implement the commitments it has made, including the Ukrainian Parliament’s adoption of legislation providing amnesty and a transitional status of local autonomy. We must now redouble our efforts to ensure that the parties fulfil all the other commitments made in the Minsk documents. On Monday, in Luxembourg, the European Union underscored the Russian Federation’s responsibility in that regard and called for the withdrawal of armed groups, military equipment, combatants and illegal mercenaries, as well as the securing of the border between Ukraine and Russia, and the constant monitoring of that border by the OSCE. We regret that it has not yet been possible to extend the OSCE monitoring mission deployed at the border posts of Gukovo and Donetsk to other border crossings adjacent to the territory occupied by the separatists.
We welcome the steps taken by the Government of Ukraine aimed at the proper holding of parliamentary elections two days from now, on 26 October. Those elections will enable the country to continue the positive reforms that began a few months ago. To ensure free and fair elections, the OSCE electoral mission will play a key role, and my country, like others around the table, will be actively involved in that mission.
We call on the Russian Federation to use its influence on the separatists to encourage the proper holding of local elections, scheduled for 7 December, under the new Ukrainian law. Indeed, only that election will make it possible to elect legitimate representatives of the relevant regions, who will be able to participate in a resumed inclusive national dialogue in Ukraine.
I will conclude by stating the obvious. It is high time to put an end to this conflict, which has already led to the deaths of more than 3,700 people, including at least 36 children. The agreements reached in Minsk present a unique opportunity that should be seized so as to restore peace. It is in no one’s interest for a new conflict to take root on the European continent.","I thank the Assistant Secretary-General Fernandez-Taranco and Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for their briefings.
Since the signing of the Minsk agreement, the Republic of Korea has been closely monitoring the situation in eastern Ukraine with the expectation that there might be a turning point towards a political solution to the crisis. However, despite the overall decrease in violence, fighting has continued to flare up in Donetsk with daily reports of shelling and skirmishes threatening to derail a fragile ceasefire. We are especially troubled by the report that more than 300 fatalities have been recorded since the ceasefire came into effect. Those ongoing ceasefire violations clearly show that the risk of the re-escalation of tensions still remains. We need to keep in mind that the slightest provocation could once again cause the situation to spiral further out of control. In the light of such a volatile situation on the ground, all concerned parties must take immediate and credible steps towards the observance of a durable ceasefire, including the full implementation of the Minsk ceasefire memorandum. Any further incitement or provocative actions aimed at disrupting the peace process must cease immediately.
In that regard, we believe that there must be effective control and credible verification of the ceasefire as an integral part of the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire memorandum. A monitoring mechanism of an international and impartial nature, as embodied in the Organization for Security and Cooperation Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, is an indispensable tool for verifying such cease fire commitments. At the same time, the safety and security of international personnel under difficult and challenging conditions must be fully guaranteed by all actors on the ground.
We also take this opportunity to reiterate our full support for the work of the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. As its recent report elaborated in detail, the protracted fighting in eastern Ukraine has resulted in further deterioration of the human rights and humanitarian situations, which continue to be a source of deep concern. We are particularly disheartened that there have been over 3,000 casualties to date, and a large number of internally displaced persons, whose situation becomes increasingly precarious with the onset of the winter. Moreover, reports of widespread human rights violations by illegal armed groups, involving killings, abductions, arbitrary detention and torture, speak to the urgency of bringing perpetrators to justice and establishing accountability.
With important elections scheduled for 26 October, we would like to reiterate that an inclusive political process is the essential foundation for a stable and democratic future for all Ukrainian people. In that regard, we welcome the progressive steps taken by the Ukrainian Government in implementing the provisions of the Minsk ceasefire memorandum, notably the adoption of a draft law on amnesty and special status for the eastern region, which is an important step towards a more inclusive political process, which we hope can provide a sound basis for the de-escalation of tensions.
In conclusion, the Republic of Korea supports the ongoing diplomatic efforts towards the stabilization of Ukraine, including the recent meetings on the sidelines of the Asia-Europe summit in Milan. While the situation on the ground remains tense, such constructive diplomatic efforts give us reasons for hope. We once again encourage all concerned parties to continue exerting maximum efforts to seek a peaceful political solution. "
S/PV.7269,19/09/2014,Updates on and discussion of the developments related to the investigation of the MH-17 crash,"I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing. The downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in eastern Ukraine on 17 July is a tragedy that caused 298 deaths. China has taken note of the preliminary report of the investigation issued by the Dutch Safety Board on 9 September. China hopes that, through an independent, just, objective and transparent international investigation, the truth can be established and justice served for victims and their loved ones at an early date. China calls upon the parties concerned to offer cooperation and coordination with the investigation in accordance with the relevant Council resolution and provide objective, authentic and verifiable evidence in order to ensure that the result of the investigation is credible and able to withstand any scrutiny. International specialized agencies, such as International Civil Aviation Organization, should continue their pivotal role in the investigation. Objectively speaking, the continuous improvement in the situation in Ukraine is conducive to the smooth conduct of the international investigation of the incident. China welcomes the recent signing between the Government of Ukraine and the militias in the east of the Minsk ceasefire agreement, which is in conformity with the fundamental, long-term interests of the Ukrainian people. China has also taken note of the bill recently adopted by the Ukrainian Parliament that grants special status to the eastern part of Ukraine. China hopes that in the next phase the parties concerned will continue their constructive efforts to ensure the effective implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreement. In the meantime, inclusive dialogue should be initiated as soon as possible in order to find a balanced, lasting and comprehensive political settlement that takes into consideration the common interests of various ethnic groups and regions in Ukraine. ","I too thank Mr. Feltman for his briefing. I also thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, Mr. Timmermans, for his briefing and his participation in our work. Two months have passed since the tragedy of Flight MH-17. The memory of the victims and their shattered futures does not go away. Today I reiterate the solidarity of France with the relatives of the passengers in their ongoing ordeal. We join in their grief and we offer them our full support. In the face of that disaster, the international community had requested that everything be done to shed light on the circumstances of the tragedy. Through resolution 2166 (2014), the Security Council has stressed the importance of quickly conducting the investigation into the circumstances of that abominable act. It was a first step towards the elucidation of the tragedy, towards establishing accountability and the need for justice. According to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, it is up to Ukraine, together with the support of all those affected by the disaster and, in particular, experts from the International Civil Aviation Organization, to conduct the work of the international investigation. The Ukrainian Government has diligently discharged that responsibility. As early as 24 July, it had entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Government of the Netherlands entrusting the Dutch Safety Board with task of conducting the investigation. Ukraine then hosted in Kyiv a group of international experts who offered their assistance. We commend the Dutch Safety Board for the quality of their experts’ work. Their professionalism in collecting information and their impartiality are exemplary. We now eagerly await the publication of the final report. Confident in the process and the results it will produce, we fully support the investigation and we urge all parties to cooperate fully with investigators. The findings of the preliminary report are serious. The investigating commission has excluded the hypothesis of a technical error, saying that the disruption of the aircraft is the result of contact with “a large number of high-energy objects”. It thus clearly points to the hypothesis that the destruction of Flight MH-17 was by a surface-to-air missile, confirming the worst fears that had already been expressed to the Council. A surface-to-air missile pointed at a civilian airliner? From that, we should draw all conclusions about those who handled that weapon system and those who gave the order to fire, but also those who allowed such weapons to be used by criminals. Resolution 2166 (2014) also required that everything be done to enable the work of investigators. All the parties and all the States in the region should guarantee immediate and unhindered access to the disaster site, the remains of the victims and material items useful for the investigation. We are sadly off the mark. Separatists have not cooperated with the Ukrainian authorities in the searches. The safe, immediate and full access to investigators was not granted. That is not only a violation of the resolution 2166 (2014), but also of what had been decided between the Contact Group — Ukraine, Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe — and the separatist representatives themselves. As proof, we cite the security detachments from the Netherlands, Australia and Malaysia that were to be deployed to the crash site to secure it but which were unable to be deployed because of obstacles put in place by the separatists. That lack of cooperation is more powerful and evocative than any propagandistic speech of separatists and their supporters. This tragedy, as we have said, occurred against a backdrop of chaos, but that chaos did not appear all by itself. By the time the plane was shot down, the violent fighting in eastern Ukraine had intensified. The separatists, who had been thoughtlessly armed, were bringing about terror and desolation. Now, all those responsible for abuses will be held accountable. And let there be no mistake. Questioning the quality of work done by the investigators and the findings of the preliminary report would be a return to methods that we hoped were long gone — denying the obvious, twisting the facts — old tricks that no longer fool anyone. Such manipulations move us away from the worthy debate we want to have today. In conclusion, I would like to say that the ceasefire applied since Friday, 5 September should be respected. We remain vigilant. But the silence of weapons is only the prerequisite for the implementation of the settlement plan for the Ukrainian crisis. To achieve a long-term solution, the discussions in the Contact Group should continue. The resolution of the conflict can only be achieved by stopping shipments of weapons to the separatists by Russia, the establishment of a lasting and verified ceasefire, the control of the border and the pursuit of political dialogue. Russia has a responsibility in that regard that it cannot avoid. It is essential to move quickly on those various issues. ","First, I thank you, Madam President, for convening today’s meeting, which was initiated by the delegation of the Russian Federation. I also thank the Under-Secretary-General for his briefing and express our particular gratitude to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, a country that has undertaken the leadership role in the investigation of the tragic incident that took place in Ukraine on 17 July. It seems to me that in the Minister’s statement, his words of gratitude to the local citizens were particularly important. On 17 July, they found themselves without warning involved in a tragic situation. We recall that over the following days, there was much criticism of the local citizens and rebels; later, it came to light that they had in fact carried out very useful work, as recognized on 6 August by the Prime Minister of the Netherlands. On 21 July, the Council adopted resolution 2166 (2014) in support of a full, thorough and independent international investigation into the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in Ukraine that resulted in the deaths of 298 people. The scale of the disaster, its political implications and consequences, and the resolution’s provisions regarding the role of the United Nations and the Security Council in political arrangements for the investigation indicate that the Council must continue to monitor the issue. Resolution 2166 (2014) sets out the modalities for conducting a comprehensive, thorough and independent international investigation. The document stipulates United Nations participation, which is particularly important to ensuring a genuine, impartial, international process and the necessary degree of transparency in the organization of the investigation. We believe that the Council has an important role to play in resolving a number of thorny issues set forth in the resolution, without which an investigation in south- eastern Ukraine cannot be conducted. These include halting all military activities of all sides in the area of the crash site, halting all activities that could threaten the integrity of the crash site, providing swift and safe access by international staff to the crash site, and supporting the role of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to ensure that the relevant investigation is guided by the principles of international civil aviation and ICAO rules and standards. In resolution 2166 (2014), the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to recommend possible ways that the United Nations could assist the investigation and report to the Council as events unfolded. It is unfortunate that to date we have seen no sign of the recommendations or any attempt by the Secretariat to demonstrate any initiative aimed at assisting the international investigation. We consider it important that the Secretary-General conduct a review and assessment of the state of affairs regarding the aforementioned issues and report on them to the Council, including with respect to the drafting and adoption of additional measures to assist the investigation. It it may be necessary to consider establishing a post of Special Representative of the Secretary-General in the matter and authorizing a relevant mission, in cooperation with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), to be sent to the crash site. Of particular relevance to United Nations participation is the current state of affairs of the investigation. The preliminary report of the Dutch Safety Board is minimally informative and contains no convincing information about the crash circumstances. There is no reference at all to resolution 2166 (2014). The promised transparency is lacking. The investigation, it seems, has been entrusted to a small group of countries. There have been delays and deferrals of the process. The data on the dispatchers’ voice recorders were transferred only in late August. Many questions have arisen regarding compliance with ICAO standards. The report contains no information on the work carried out by the Ukrainian military, on the voice recordings of the armed forces with the dispatchers, or on the deployment of the Ukrainian anti-aircraft system on the day of the catastrophe, and it is totally silent concerning the possible presence of fighter jets in the vicinity of the flight path of Flight MH-17. We are also concerned about a certain indifference conveyed in the report regarding the issue of lack of access to the crash site. Yet it is a priority issue involving relevant tasks — indeed, urgent tasks. The debris could be of key importance in establishing the circumstances surrounding the crash of Flight MH-17; unfortunately, much important expertise on that and other aspects has not been forthcoming. After the pause on 6 August in the work of the international experts at the crash site, no journalists or OSCE observers have visited the site. It is not clear what is stopping the team from going to Donetsk now, given the ceasefire. We are not questioning the sovereignty of the State where the event occurred — Ukraine — to arrange the investigation of the crash that took place in its air space and to address the issue of confidentiality regarding the investigation. However, pursuant to resolution 2166 (2014), the arrangement should ensure the authentically international nature of the organization of and participation in the investigation. Experts are needed from various countries to participate in the group of international experts — including Russian nationals and representatives of the Interstate Aviation Committee — to work together as a unified team with fair and equal access to all materials necessary to carry out the investigation. We must shed light on the truth regarding the incident that took place in Ukrainian air space on 17 July; it is therefore imperative to shed light not only on the root causes and the perpetrators, but also on the political circumstances that led to the disaster itself. The tragedy has been manipulated by a number of countries to exacerbate international tensions. Immediately following the incident, even before receiving any reliable information, public statements were made, in which full blame was attributed to the militants. Our country was held responsibility for the perpetration of serious international violations. Let us not forget that those actions were the grounds for the cycle of sanctions against Russia. We believe that to be an act of information warfare, blatant interference into the investigation of the accident and a political attempt to predetermine the results of the investigation. The Russian Federation was the first and, in fact, only country to immediately and openly provide all available and impartial information related to the crash. The Russian Defence Ministry and the Federal Air Transport Agency not only released information but also presented a list of questions that must be answered for an objective picture of what happened. Many of those issues were put to the Ukrainian side. Unfortunately, most of those questions, including the most important, have not been answered objectively. We are convinced that an unbiased and impartial investigation will be needed to clarify all those concerns. On many occasions, we heard from a number of States that they allegedly had verified information about what happened, including satellite images of the area where the 17 July crash occurred. We call on them to disclose that information. In conclusion, I would like to underscore that Russia continues to insist on the holding of a transparent and objective international investigation in full compliance with all requirements and standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization in order to establish the truth. We believe that that goal can be achieved only with United Nations assistance and involvement in the investigation, in line with resolution 2166 (2014). The preliminary report on the causes of the crash does not address our concerns but, in fact, gives rise to new questions that the Russian side is ready to discuss with its foreign partners in a constructive way. The list of questions is something that we intend to send to the commission of inquiry and to the Secretary- General. We will distribute it as an official Security Council document. As we initiated today’s meeting, and as a number of assertions have been made concerning, in one way or another, with the content of our statement and the Russian position, I would like to make a few remarks. First, in some statements, there were affirmations that Russia, in its statement in today’s meeting, sought somehow to call into question the investigations conducted by the Dutch Safety Board, and that is absolutely not true. However, the Council will agree that it is somewhat strange that the Board has published a preliminary report in which there is not even one reference to resolution 2166 (2014). In the report, the Board, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs noted, very accurately, professionally and correctly formulated the targets of its work so as to prevent the recurrence of such an incident in the future, and that is quite right. However, let us be honest. We are not experts, but I think that everyone here today knows what is necessary to ensure that such a tragedy does not happen again. Flights should not be sent into conflict areas, and civilian aircraft should not be targeted. However, as our German colleague rightly stated, there are many pending questions, and these questions, we believe, lie in the area between the Dutch investigation and resolution 2166 (2014). We are not proposing abolishing the Board or creating a new one. The first thing we are going to do is send our questions to the Board. Then we shall continue to work with it, with the broader participation of international bodies such as the International Civil Aviation Organization, which is mentioned in resolution 2166 (2014), and draw on all the resources that the United Nations has to offer. The need for cooperation is also mentioned in the resolution. Now, some rather strange bits of information were cited that I must comment on. Our Ukrainian colleague, for example, said that rebels at the crash site attempted to somehow hide evidence, and the United States representative surprisingly quoted something a rebel had allegedly said to the effect that Moscow wanted the black boxes. If Moscow had wanted those black boxes, why did they end up London? If my colleagues are going to be so literary in their expressions, I would ask them to follow the chronology. Two or three days after the crash, the black boxes were transferred entirely intact to the Malaysians present at the crash site, and the Malaysians then provided them to London. Now, how could Moscow receive those black boxes from London, when the report states that they were indeed intact? We should in fact thank the rebels that the black boxes were kept intact and transferred to the experts who are now working with them. The United States also accused Russia of blocking access to the crash site for 10 days. That is not true. The Australian delegation, I think, can underscore that this is not the case, because as soon as resolution 2166 (2014) was adopted, the question of the security of the area arose. Telephone calls were made between the President of Russia and the Prime Ministers of the Netherlands and Australia. During those phone calls, we discussed the possibility of adopting yet another Council resolution that would ensure a presence at the crash site that would guarantee the security of the investigations. Moreover, with our Australian colleagues, we even presented a draft text on that issue. I recall that we asked them if they might care like to author the draft resolution and did not insist that it be our draft, but stated that if they wanted something, there it was. We offered to adopt it that very day. However, Australia and the Netherlands took a different decision, as was their right. They decided to start negotiations with the Ukrainian side. Why did those talks go on for 10 days? That is their right and a question of their relations with Ukraine, but Russia was ready to do everything in its power to ensure that international investigators came promptly to the crash site. Certain questions have been raised regarding security. Once again, the rebels have somehow been blamed for everything. The rebels controlled the area of the crash site. Why was there gunfire at the site? The most important security issue was ensuring that the Kyiv authorities did not attempt to seize that area in violation of resolution 2166 (2014). Moreover, Russia twice attempted to stop such incursions into the crash site so that the investigation might proceed normally. On 28 July, when Kyiv threatened to seize the area of the crash site, we proposed a draft press statement for the Security Council calling for the implementation of resolution 2166 (2014), and for some reason three Security Council members blocked it. On 7 August, when the Ukrainian Government had declared that it would bypass the ceasefire regime, and that its decision had been approved by the investigating countries, we again convened a Council meeting and called for compliance with the resolution. For some reason, Council members could not agree once again. So if security has not been upheld, Russia is not to blame. The sponsors of the Kyiv Government and their military actions are the ones to blame. Regarding the shots fired on the monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on 14 September, for some reason people said that the rebels were responsible. That is not right. There were two shots, coming from the north, which was the position of the Ukrainian armed forces, and one of those shots happened at a border crossing point that was controlled by rebels. The rebels would not have been shooting at themselves, would they? Another issue has been raised that I do not think is appropriate for the Security Council, since we are not here to discuss various versions of what happened. However, as some colleagues have allowed themselves to get into such analyses, I must respond. Our United Kingdom colleague, for example, said that a Buk missile system with three missiles instead of four was seen, as he affirmed, moving towards Russia, and that it was that system that shot down the Malaysian aircraft. Indeed, such images were distributed by the Kyiv authorities and made their way around the world. But why would one believe that the Buk missile system was heading for Russia? The most important thing here is that it was clear from those images that the launch system was heading west, towards an area controlled by the rebels. The Kyiv authorities were therefore incriminating themselves by claiming that the Malaysian aircraft was shot down by that system. That would have meant that they had launched the missile. Once again, Russian officials have accused no one. We shared our information. We asked questions and asked for clarifications, but we did not accuse anyone, and we said that there should be investigations. Some colleagues were hasty in saying that the investigations had shown that the aeroplane was shot down by a rocket. We do not see anything about that in the preliminary report. It speaks of three civilian aircraft in the area of the Malaysian aeroplane, but we do not see any evidence stating that there was no military aircraft. With regard to the information provided by our Ministry for Foreign Affairs, we wonder if there has been any contact at all between the Board and the Ukrainian armed forces. We do not know. Perhaps, under the Board’s standard working regulations, they cannot be in contact with military officers but only with civilian representatives. In that case, the Security Council might do something to broaden the scope of the work and ensure that they are in contact with those who can respond to those questions. Furthermore, with regard to the exclusion of the type of aircraft in the preliminary report, I recall that representatives of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe who saw the remains in the very first days said that even an amateur could understand that the aircraft had been shot down by an air-to-air system. I am no specialist, but that is what the evidence indicated. Now if we want to talk about the versions put forward recently in the German Parliament, an answer to the question posed by a Deputy of Parliament was put forth. The answer was based on information provided by NATO, which had said that it could have been a different anti-aircraft rocket system that is not used by the Russian army but is used by the Ukrainian army. Once again, the Security Council is not the place for members to be putting forward various hypotheses. It is a place to assist with the investigations and clarify the questions to which we want answers. I repeat, we will send our questions to the Dutch Safety Board and hope that they will be addressed credibly and transparently and that the questions will be distributed as a Security Council document. Let the entire world work collectively to ensure that this tragic incident is fully clarified without any insinuations, intimations or references to evidence that has not been brought forth. If members are not sharing information, what they are providing is not an eyewitness account, but rather fiction. That is not suitable evidence for the investigation. While you hold the presidency, Madam President, you do not have the right to pass judgment on the status of the Russian Federation in the Security Council. The second part of your statement only shows that you are attempting to dilute the circumstances. Let me put it this way. Even if everything you just said is right, that has nothing to do with the investigation into the downed flight. So let us not get into various political issues and insinuations beyond the scope of the investigation, because we might have different opinions in that regard. Let us concentrate on the required investigation.  I would just like to respond to the statement made just now by the representative of Lithuania and then to the representative of the United Kingdom. I do not really understand why the representative of Lithuania is raising the question. Why would Russia not convene the meeting? She blamed us for this incident, but then when we have questions about the course of the investigations, she says that this is somehow insulting to the memory of the victims. That is, indeed, some kind of extreme cynicism. The best way to pay due tribute to the memory of the victims is by answering all the questions by undertaking an investigation in accordance with resolution 2166 (2014). With regard to the statement made by our English colleague, one of his great approaches is not to dispute what we say in the Council, but to interpretat what I said or might have said in the press somewhere. However, let us carefully look at what was said in the Council. As to my somehow not having spoken truthfully, take all the records of our meetings and highlight the areas where I did not speak truthfully and show them to me. I am talking about transcriptions, because what my colleague has said about my statements was totally inaccurate. First of all, we are coming to the end of the meeting and finally we are ending on a positive note. I am very happy to hear the Foreign Minister of Australia say that experts are ready to go back to the crash site. That is indeed what we have called for in our statement today. But the Minister should understand that Russia — and I have already said this — has attempted to do everything possible to ensure security. But if the Kyiv forces are shelling the area, then we say that we, as the Security Council, should tell them not to do that. But some Council members say, “No, we cannot call upon the Kyiv authorities not to shell”. Well, then, how is Russia is going to ensure security in that case? How can it? I cited a specific example of how two times we proposed that the Security Council call upon the Ukrainian armed forces, when they said they wanted to go into the area of the crash site, not to do so. But the Council did not want to. Russia is doing everything it can and drawing on the contacts it has with representatives in the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics. ","I thank Mr. Feltman for his briefing and acknowledge the presence in the Security Council this morning of the Foreign Ministers of the Netherlands, Australia and Luxembourg. The United Kingdom welcomes the Dutch Safety Board’s preliminary report of 9 September and would like once again to send our deepest condolences to the friends and families of those who died on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. Last month, I had to honour to lay a wreath on behalf of all Security Council members at the memorial site in Schiphol airport in honour of the 298 victims of the tragedy. We commend the Dutch Safety Board for having produced a report that is thorough, professional and based firmly on the facts. While it is a preliminary report with a limited mandate, the conclusions drawn from the evidence available to the investigators are clear. The report rules out any operational or technical causes for the crash. The damage discovered on the wreckage of Flight MH-17 is consistent with the damage that would be expected from a large number of high-energy objects penetrating the aircraft from the outside. From that we can draw only one conclusion: Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, a civilian airliner carrying 283 passengers and 15 crew, was hit by a blast fragmentation warhead, which is typically fitted to surface-to-air missiles. Neither the preliminary report nor the final report will seek to attribute culpability. But we know that seconds before Flight MH-17 dropped out of contact, a surface-to-air missile launch was detected from a separatist-controlled area in south-eastern Ukraine. We also know from an intercepted conversation that a known separatist leader was overheard claiming that a separatist faction had shot down an aircraft at the time of MH-17’s disappearance. Another separatist leader claimed on Twitter to have shot down an aircraft around the same time. We have seen on social media, shortly after the crash, an SA-11 missile system missing at least one missile travelling back towards Russia, and we also know that separatist fighters trained, equipped and armed by Russia shot down more than a dozen Ukrainian aircraft in the months before the tragedy of M H -17. I, and others, have spoken before in the Council about Russia’s supply of significant quantities of advanced weapons, including tanks, armoured personnel carriers and artillery to separatist groups in Ukraine. And there is evidence that Russia has been providing training to separatist fighters at a facility in south-western Russia, including training on how to use air defence systems. The Russian Federation bears significant responsibility for the violence and instability in south-eastern Ukraine — responsibility that, at the very least, means Russia has questions to answer about the tragic downing of MH-17. Assertions promoted heavily in domestic Russian media that Ukraine had some degree of culpability in bringing down MH-17 simply do not stand up. They are sham arguments that attempt to distort the facts. We have heard contradictory stories that MH-17 was brought down by a Ukrainian Su-25 fighter jet, either by missile or by gunfire, or that it shadowed MH-17, using its crew and passengers as human shields. But the damage found on the wreckage of MH-17 is not consistent with the behaviour of an air-to-air missile, nor does it relate to a gun attack. Radar evidence shows only three commercial aircraft in the vicinity of MH-17 before the occurrence which led to its breakup. There was no Su-25 visible on any Ukrainian radar data, and international investigators regard that data as accurate and reliable. That Russian version of events is pure fiction. Russian allegations of the malign intentions of Ukrainian air traffic control and insinuations that air traffic control records were subsequently being withheld also do not add up. There is no evidence of any unusual activity in the management of flights in that area at the time, and the preliminary report contains a full transcript of the conversations between MH-17 and Ukrainian air traffic control. The transcripts of the Ukrainian side have been fully confirmed by data that was traced back from the black box. We have also heard Russian suggestions that the Dutch Safety Board report is not fully independent or impartial and has ignored the opinion of Russian investigators. That also is untrue. The Board is a fully independent organization. As we have heard this morning, it was assisted in its investigation by experts from 12 aviation agencies, including experts from Russia, and it has been advised by the International Civil Aviation Organization to ensure that its report complied fully with international standards and recommended practices. The Dutch Safety Board has set out particular areas in the report that require further analysis if this important investigation is to make progress. That will require full and safe access to the crash site, as demanded by the Council in resolution 2166 (2014). That is also needed for the separate criminal investigation, which will determine culpability and ensure accountability. Firing on OSCE monitors, such as occurred last weekend near the crash site, does not create the conditions for a resumption of the investigation into how MH-17 came down and who was responsible. If the Russian Federation shares the wish of the international community to see progress on both the Dutch Safety Board final report and resolution 2166 (2014), then we call on them to ensure that the separatists allow safe full access to the crash site immediately. I think that the fact that the representative of the Russian Federation has come to the Council on multiple occasions and said things that have subsequently proved to be untrue is relevant when we are discussing his attitude towards this investigation. I will not repeat all the things that my colleague from the United States said in her initial statement, but all the statements that Ambassador Churkin has made in the Council about the fact that there were no additional Russian forces in Crimea just before the military annexation of Crimea, that there was no supply of weapons into eastern Ukraine, that there was no training of eastern Ukrainian separatists in Russia and that there were no Russian troops in Ukraine have been demonstrated to have been false statements. However, let me just return to the subject of today’s discussion, which is the investigation. Ambassador Churkin said to the press on 10 September, “I have to conclude that a real international investigation did not take place”. If that is not trying to undermine this independent credible investigation, I do not know what is. ","I shall now make a statement in my national capacity as the representative of the United States. I wish to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his informative briefing. I also thank Ministers Timmermans, Bishop and Asselborn for being here and signalling the importance of this issue with their presence. First, on behalf of the United States, let us once again convey our condolences to the loved ones of the victims of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. We do not presume to grasp the depth of their grief, but we mourn the lives of those they lost. We convene today for an update on the investigation into a crime that abruptly ended too many lives. The purpose of the investigation is to determine the truth about what brought down that plane. For any investigation to be credible, we all agree that it must be thorough, impartial and professional. Ukraine and the whole international community turned to the Dutch Safety Board because we believed it was more than capable of meeting those standards. The Board’s preliminary findings reflect its independence and its expertise. Those findings, submitted to the Security Council on 9 September, include the following. First, the aircraft was brought down by “a large number of high-energy objects that penetrated the aircraft from the outside.” Secondly, there were no engine warnings, aircraft system warnings or distress messages detected. Thirdly, the damage to the aircraft is “not consistent with any known failure mode of the aircraft, its engines or systems.” Fourthly, the only planes identified in the report that were in the vicinity of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 were commercial aircraft. Based on those preliminary findings one can rule out that Flight MH-17 was brought down by a bomb on board. It was not. Russian claims that the flight was brought down by a Ukrainian fighter jet are also not supported by evidence in the report. Moreover, ground photography is consistent with the expected damage from a surface-to-air missile, but does not correspond with the damage that a short-range air-to-air missile from a smaller warhead would produce. Those facts are important because they contradict the fiction that has been propagated by Russia. The Dutch Safety Board’s findings are consistent, however, with evidence gathered by a group of countries, including the United States, pointing to the fact that Flight MH-17 was shot down by a surface-to-air missile fired from territory controlled by Russian-backed separatists. Russia called for today’s meeting under the pretence of being briefed on the status of the investigation. The representative of the Russian Federation today has appealed for what he calls “an objective and transparent investigation.” But in its intervention today Russia made clear that its real intention is not to learn about the investigation, but to discredit it. Russia is seeking to play the role of forensic aviation investigator, but cannot do so in an impartial and objective manner. Russian-backed separatists denied access to the crash site for days after Flight MH-17 was downed. Russian- backed separatists then restricted access after initially letting outside officials in. That is not consistent with an objective and transparent investigation. The representative of the Russian Federation today complained about the timeliness of the voice recordings being processed. Yet telephone conversations intercepted by the Ukrainian Government indicate that the commander of a pro-Russian separatist unit told local state emergency service employees that Moscow wanted to find the black boxes, and he enlisted the support of those local officials to help recover the boxes. That is not consistent with the desire to ensure the sanctity of the recordings, which today the Russian representative professes a desire to protect. The Russian representative says that the report does not contain “convincing information.” In order to be convinced of facts one must acknowledge them. In order to be convinced of truth one must allow it to surface. One can be convinced if one confronts the facts as they are established and proven, not as one may wish they were. It is time to allow facts, however inconvenient, to be uncovered, and it is time to stop all attempts to undermine the credibility of a thorough, impartial and independent investigation that the international community has no reason to doubt. Russia does not have the track record to play the credible investigator here. Russia has repeatedly misled the Council, its own people and the world about its support for illegal armed groups and its own military incursions into Ukraine. Just read the records of the previous 24 Security Council meetings on Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Read Russia’s denials that it was arming and training separatists in Crimea, and later its denials that it had deployed troops to Crimea. Read Russia’s denials that it was arming and training separatists in eastern Ukraine, and later its denials that it had deployed troops to eastern Ukraine. The Dutch Safety Board has been delegated the authority by Ukraine, in line with the International Civil Aviation Authority standards, to investigate this crash. If Russia has evidence that it believes can help identify who shot down Flight MH-17 it has a responsibility to share that information with the independent investigators. Too many lives have been lost, and this conflict has gone on for too long. It is time for Russia to bring its intervention to an end. That is why we fully support the ceasefire and agreements signed in Minsk, which aim to de-escalate the conflict that has taken approximately 3,000 lives. We fully support a negotiated political solution to this crisis, as we have asserted since Russia’s incitements created the conf lict. We welcome reports that Russia is decreasing its troop levels in eastern Ukraine, even if Russia continues to deny that its troops were there in the first place. We also welcome Russia’s recent statements expressing support for the ceasefire. However, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the crisis in eastern Ukraine, just like the occupation and annexation of Crimea before it, was manufactured by Moscow. No country should support carving off pieces of sovereign Ukraine and handing them to the aggressors. The territorial integrity of Ukraine is non-negotiable. Ukraine has demonstrated remarkably good faith in meeting its commitments. This week, notwithstanding the aggression against the State by the separatists and by Russian forces, Ukraine’s Parliament passed legislation granting certain districts in eastern Ukraine special status, which includes greater self-governance, economic control and Russian-language rights. Now it is Russia’s turn. Russia must immediately withdraw all of its forces and equipment from Ukraine, including Crimea, and cease all forms of support and training for separatist groups. Russia and the separatists it backs must release all of their hostages and prisoners. Russia must finally close its borders to the flow of soldiers, separatists, tanks, artillery and other machinery of war. It must grant Ukraine control over its own border. Russia and the groups it backs must create an environment that allows the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to fulfil its monitoring and verification mandate. There is one very important imperative we must remember, which brings us back as to why we convened today — truth. Two hundred and ninety-eight innocent people were killed on 17 July. The international community has identified an independent investigative body to uncover the truth about what happened to Flight MH-17. Today we join the chorus of Member States in reiterating our full support for the Dutch Safety Board’s investigation, and we reject Russia’s efforts to disparage it or to hinder its progress. The next step is the pursuit of justice, and when those responsible for this horrific crime are eventually identified, they will be punished. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. I give the floor to Dato Sri Anifah Aman, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malaysia. I would now like to make a further statement in my national capacity. I have only one response to the representative from the Russian Federation. Russia is fighting in Ukraine. Russia has provided artillery and surface-to-air missiles to separatists in Ukraine. It has trained separatists on those surface-to-air missiles. It has moved troops into Ukraine. Russia has no standing to offer advice on this investigation, and it has no credibility before the Council in its professions, as its story has shifted for months. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. The representative of the Russian Federation has asked for the floor to make a further statement. ",,,,,,,,,,,"Thank you, Madam President, for the opportunity to participate in the discussion of such an important issue for my country. I would also like to thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman and Mr. Frans Timmermans, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, for their briefings. Two days ago marked two months since a terrible tragedy in the Ukrainian sky took the lives of about 300 people. Nothing can heal the pain of that terrible loss. No words of condolence can soothe the families and friends of the victims of the tragedy. Our duty is to find the perpetrators of the crime and to hold them accountable, for the sake of justice, and to ensure that such tragedies will not happen in future.
From the very first day of the tragedy, Ukraine has demonstrated its openness and commitment to transparent, inclusive international cooperation in order to establish the true cause of the crash. Following the adoption of resolution 2166 (2014), which Ukraine co-sponsored, and given the fact that the vast majority of the victims were citizens of the Netherlands, we transferred the right to investigate the air crash to the Dutch Safety Board. By so doing we contributed to ensuring a fair, objective and impartial investigation. The Dutch Safety Board is being assisted by experts from Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the United States, Russia, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the European Aviation Safety Agency and other parties concerned.
In addition, the relevant Ukrainian authorities have been providing necessary support to the international mission in order to safeguard the investigation established by an agreement between Ukraine and the Kingdom of the Netherlands to facilitate the recovery of the remains of the victims and to conduct an investigation as called for by resolution 2166 (2014).
Contrary to what the Russian representative said today about the late submission of materials and about the negotiations between the Board and air traffic control centres in Ukraine, I should remind the Council that a week after the crash, on 23 July, an international group of experts was provided electronic and paper records of negotiations between the flight crew and staff from the Lviv, Kyiv and Dnipropetrovsk control centres involved in the air traffic control of the aircraft, as well as various types of radar materials. Most probably, that was mentioned by Ambassador Churkin at the end of August. With regard to the additional request made by the Netherlands, we provided additional materials involving the recordings of conversations between the flight crew and Ukrainian air traffic controllers.
Ukraine remains committed to resolution 2166 (2014), calling for full respect for the ceasefire and for ensuring the security and safety of the international investigation in the immediate area surrounding the crash site. However, the illegal armed groups that control the crash site have been jeopardizing the efforts of the investigators. Before the international investigators arrived at the crash site for the first time, Russian-controlled militants had already been at work at the site — as it were, to clear it of evidence. They were not interested in revealing the truth, which could obviously be harmful to them and to those who support them.
The preliminary report of the Dutch Safety Board establishes that external factors caused the accident of Flight MH-17. That adds to our conviction that Flight MH-17 was shot down by a surface-to-air missile. In the very first days after the crash, we submitted evidence we had collected that it was a Russian missile launched by Russian mercenaries.
The Russian Federation continues to send powerful air defence systems to support militants in the east of Ukraine. Those facts are repeatedly recorded not only by Ukrainian intelligence, but also by intelligence agencies of other countries. A recent fact is that militants received from Russia a Pantsir armoured rocket launcher that is capable of hitting targets at an altitude of 15 kilometres. We must therefore reiterate that the tragedy of Flight MH-17 would not have happened if militants had not acquired access to sophisticated Russian weapons, such as air-defence systems capable of hitting targets at high altitudes.
Unfortunately, the tragedy of Flight MH-17 has not taught Russia a good lesson. Moscow continues to deny that it is arming terrorists with heavy weaponry. All attempts by Russia to shift the responsibility for that terrible attack onto someone else do not withstand criticism. The Russian leadership persists in repeating the necessity of stopping the bloodshed, while it continues to contribute to the escalation of the conflict by supporting terrorists, sending in mercenaries and regular troops, violating Ukraine-Russia border and shutting Ukrainian troops out of their territory.
None of the provisions of the Minsk protocol of 5 September have been implemented by Russia. On a daily basis, we have been recording numerous ceasefire violations by Russian troops and the Moscow-controlled militants. In total, they have broken the ceasefire and shelled Ukrainian miltary and civilians 480 times since the truce started. As a result, 22 Ukrainian military personnel have been killed and 138 wounded. Russia continues its military build-up along the border with Ukraine, as well as in temporarily occupied Crimea. The Russian artillery and mortar shelling of the territory of Ukraine, which, inter alia, was confirmed by monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, have become a daily threat to Ukrainian servicemen and civilians on the ground.
We therefore urge both Russia and the Russian-controlled militants to comply with their commitments, including those undertaken in accordance with the Minsk protocol to ensure the success of the international mission to the crash site and the safety and security of international civil aviation flights. We expect that the final results of the investigation, the impartiality of which is beyond any doubt, will make it possible to affirm the real cause of the catastrophe and to establish the perpetrators of that brutal terrorist act in order to bring them to justice. When we found out that it was Russia that took the initiative to convene today’s Security Council meeting, we asked ourselves why. Having heard the same old rhetoric from the Russian side today, which denies any involvement in the crime and blames everyone but itself, I cannot help but remember the old saying that a guilty mind is never at ease.","At the outset, I would like to thank Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans and Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for their insightful briefings.
More than two months have passed since the downing of Flight MH-17. A total of 298 lives, including four German citizens, were tragically lost. We grief with those who have lost loved ones and extend our deepest condolences to our friends in the Netherlands, Malaysia, Australia and all the other countries that are mourning the loss of their citizens.
Although two months have passed, the downing of Flight MH-17 will not be forgotten. By adopting resolution 2166 (2014), the Council has reacted and sent out a clear signal, namely, that we must establish the facts. We want to know who is responsible. We must bring them to justice.
We commend the Netherlands for taking the lead in a thorough and inclusive international investigation into the downing of Flight MH-17. The preliminary report clearly affirms that the plane did not crash as a result of technical or human failure. However, too many questions remain unanswered. It is outrageous that the investigations on the ground and the repatriation of human remains are still being hampered by armed separatist groups. That is a clear violation of resolution 2166 (2014) and an insult to the victims and the Council. All parties with influence on the ground must do everything possible to allow for a quick return of the experts to the crash site.
We hope that the provisions of the Minsk protocol of 5 September, especially the mutually agreed ceasefire, will also improve the situation at the crash site. That agreement offers the best opportunity we have to end the bloodshed, to embark on a political process and to bring about a political solution to the conflict. Its crucial elements are the following.
First, the Russian-Ukrainian border must be secured. We call on Russia to end fully and unconditionally its military activities on or directed against Ukrainian territory, to halt the continuing flow of weapons and fighters across the border and to take a constructive role in stabilizing Ukraine. Secondly, we call for the full reintegration of eastern Ukraine into Ukraine’s State structures, while empowering local self-government under Ukrainian law. Thirdly, we urge full respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. In that regard, I reiterate our condemnation of the illegal annexation of Crimea, which we will not recognize.
Germany has committed itself to supporting Ukraine in such difficult times. We will continue to work closely with our partners in the European Union, the Group of Seven (G-7) and the United Nations, as well as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has played a key role in helping to de-escalate the crisis. It is our deep conviction that the crisis can be solved only politically, in accordance with international law and in full respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. It is the responsibility of all members of the Council to uphold those principles.",,,"Let me first convey my delegation’s appreciation to you, Madam President, for having convened this important meeting. I also wish to thank the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs for his briefing and to acknowledge the presence of the Foreign Ministers of Australia, Luxembourg, Malaysia and the Netherlands.
Almost two months ago, in this very Chamber, all of us were mourning and paying tribute to the innocent victims of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 (see S/PV.7221). We grieved with the families and friends who had lost loved ones, and supported them in their pain.
Today, the sorrow remains and the bereaved are anxious to seek solace. The international community owes them justice, and we need to reassure the victims’ families that we still stand with them. The Security Council in particular needs to continue its support for and strong commitment to the implementation of resolution 2166 (2014), working together with all the relevant actors.
Indonesia welcomes the preliminary report on the tragedy of Flight MH-17 conducted by the Dutch Safety Board, together with other investigation teams. We support the objective of the investigation to examine the cause of the accident and to prevent similar incidents. We also take note of the findings that, at the time of the incident, Flight MH-17 was flying in unrestricted airspace above the restricted area mentioned by the aviation authority and that the aircraft was in an airworthy condition at departure, with no technical malfunctions.
While there has been little progress in the coordinated access to the wreckage site by the international team of air safety investigators, we support the intention of the Dutch Safety Board to conduct a further investigation of the site should the possibility arise. Indonesia stands ready to continue to render our assistance through our National Transportation Safety Committee for the ongoing investigation. In that context, we wish to underscore the importance of a thorough and comprehensive investigation with a strong emphasis on transparency and impartiality.
We are cognizant of the fact that the report is preliminary. However, it is based on the initial findings that “the aircraft was penetrated by a large number of high-energy objects from outside”. Evidently, more work needs to be undertaken. It is important to emphasize that the investigation must include unrestricted access to the immediate site and ensure the safety and security of the investigation team. Therefore, we request that a detailed and thorough investigation of the crash of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH-17 continue. At the same time, we also reiterate our strong demand that those responsible for the incident be held accountable. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"On 17 July, the downing of flight MH-17 caused the death of 298 innocent people. Their lives ended abruptly in midair above Ukrainian territory — 298 innocent people from 11 countries and four continents. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who lost their loved ones. Four days later, I had the honour to address the Council (see S/PV.7221). That day, the Council unanimously adopted resolution 2166 (2014). We remain grateful for that, and we appreciate today’s opportunity to brief the Council on where we are two months and two days after this unspeakable tragedy.
We remain fully committed to completing the repatriation of human remains and personal belongings and to facilitating the investigation into the cause of the crash. We will continue to devote ourselves to ensuring justice for the victims and their loved ones. We will not rest until those responsible for this heinous crime are held accountable.
Let me here recall paragraph three of the memorandum of understanding between the Netherlands and Ukraine in which we agree that:
“The Netherlands will coordinate the investigation into the circumstances of the accident, and will be responsible for the conduct of the investigation in line with the provisions of Chapter 5 of Annex 13 to the Chicago Convention. The Netherlands will ensure the participation of other parties concerned, in particular Ukraine as the State of Occurrence, Malaysia as the State of Registry, the United States of America as the State of Manufacture and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The Netherlands will communicate the report and findings to the concerned States. Ukraine will use every means available to facilitate the investigation.”
I want to thank the countries that have actively supported the implementation of resolution 2166 (2014). It has been a privilege working with them, and I salute the high level of professionalism, especially the human nature of the efforts being made — so much humanity. We are particularly appreciative of the tireless efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on the ground under very, very difficult conditions. We have tremendous respect for the work done by the rescue workers, initially by very brave people from Ukraine, later by a joint team of Malaysian, Australian and Dutch forensic experts.
Regrettably, rescue and investigation operations at the site had to be suspended on 6 August because of the deteriorating security situation. We are determined to finish that work as soon as the security situation allows us to do so. I urge all relevant parties to ensure immediate and safe access to the site. We count on all of them to make full implementation of resolution 2166 (2014) possible.
For the Netherlands, the first priority was and is to bring home the remains of the victims and their personal belongings. At present, 225 of the 298 victims have been identified in the ongoing identification process. That excruciatingly difficult work is being carried out by experts from 11 different countries. They deserve our deepest respect. Most of the remains have been recovered, but we have the duty to make sure that all remains and belongings are brought home. We will continue to cooperate intensively with all countries and international organizations involved to make this happen.
As stipulated in resolution 2166 (2014), a thorough investigation into the cause of the crash is under way. In accordance with the agreement signed with Ukraine, the independent Dutch Safety Board has assumed the lead in this investigation, in close cooperation with other countries involved, as well as with the United Nations and ICAO. It has set up the investigation in full accordance with international law and regulations, in particular Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civilian Aviation, which prescribes rules that need to be followed. In accordance with those requirements the following countries have contributed to the international investigation team: Australia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Russia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States. ICAO and the European Aviation Safety Agency have also contributed to the investigation.
The Safety Board is committed to transparency and will take all relevant information into account. I want to underline the independent nature of the Board. Neither the Dutch Government nor any other Government has any control over, or influence on, its work and its conclusions and recommendations. My Government is committed to the truth and nothing but the truth. The full independence of the Safety Board is the best way to ensure that.
In accordance with paragraph 7.1 of annex 13 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, a preliminary report was presented by the Safety Board on 9 September. The preliminary report provides an overview of the initial provisional facts. The report has been sent to ICAO for consideration. ICAO President Aliu remarked that ICAO is encouraged to see that the MH-17 investigation is proceeding with the productive collaboration of accredited international representatives. ICAO will continue to provide its full support to the Netherlands, in conjunction with its international team, while it awaits the conclusions and recommendations that will be contained in the final report on the accident.
For the final report, also required by annex 13 of the Convention, further consideration of available data, including those deduced from the remains of the victims, is needed. As the preliminary report states, although additional investigations at the crash site itself would be preferable, it is possible to conduct an effective investigation based on other available sources and to produce a final report. The final report is expected to be published next summer.
The Netherlands remains fully committed to bringing those responsible for that heinous act to justice. The Netherlands Public Prosecution Service has started the largest criminal investigation in Dutch history. The Public Prosecution Service has set up close cooperation with the national investigation and prosecution authorities of all other countries affected by the tragedy. We all share the same goal. Those responsible need to be brought to justice. My Government has been informed by the Public Prosecution Services that the investigation is complex, but that progress is being made.
For all three dimensions of the crash of MH-17 — recovery, investigation and accountability — it remains of the utmost importance to gain safe access to the site as soon as possible. We have deployed personnel in Ukraine so they can move to the crash site as soon as the security situation is stable enough. We have an ongoing dialogue about this with Malaysia and Australia. We are conscious of the responsibility we have taken upon ourselves. We will do whatever is needed to live up to that responsibility. We will not let the Council down.
Let me conclude with the same words I used the last time I addressed the Council. My country will not rest until all facts are known and justice is served.",,,,,,,,,"Thank you, Madam President, for convening this meeting and for this opportunity to address the Security Council. I also wish to convey my appreciation to Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing on the latest developments in Ukraine.
I recognize my colleagues, Her Excellency Ms. Julie Bishop of Australia, His Excellency Mr. Jean Asselborn of Luxembourg and His Excellency Mr. Frans Timmermans of the Netherlands. I wish to thank Ms. Bishop for her tireless efforts in seeking justice for the victims and closure for their families. I also wish to also thank Mr. Timmermans for the comprehensive briefing and for the Netherlands leadership in this international investigation.
Over the past few months, we and our Governments have worked very closely in various areas, including on the recovery and repatriation of the remains of victims as well as the ongoing investigation on the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. I hope that, over the coming days, we will continue such cooperation in order to ultimately bring closure to this tragic incident.
I wish to take this opportunity to convey my deepest and heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives on board that ill-fated plane.
The downing of Flight MH-17 starkly highlights the tragic consequences when a situation deteriorates into violent armed conflict. In that connection, Malaysia welcomes the announcement of the ceasefire agreement between the parties concerned on 5 September, including those in eastern Ukraine, where Flight MH-I7 was downed and where its wreckage still lies, more than two months later.
As highlighted in Under-Secretary-General Feltman’s briefing earlier, the situation on the ground remains fragile. In that regard, Malaysia urges all parties to exercise maximum restraint to prevent a further escalation of the conflict. Malaysia also reiterates the call on all parties to respect the ceasefire agreement and spare no effort to work towards a sustainable peace. In Malaysia’s view, a sustained ceasefire, particularly in eastern Ukraine, is crucial so as to enable a full, thorough and independent international investigation into the incident, as demanded by the Council in resolution 2166 (2014).
In the immediate aftermath of the downing of Flight MH-I7, Malaysia was very clear on its priorities. Primarily, those were to secure assurances on, first, the recovery of the remains of the victims; secondly, the recovery of the flight data and cockpit voice recorders; and, thirdly, safe access by international investigators to the crash site. In seeking to achieve those objectives, Malaysia reached out to all the parties concerned. For Malaysia, the humanitarian and human element was of first and foremost concern.
Consequently, an understanding was reached on the three priorities I just mentioned. Thus far, the first two assurances have been implemented. Unfortunately, coordinated and unfettered access to the crash site by the international team of air safety investigators has not yet been possible, due to the ongoing fighting in and around the crash site.
With regard to the ongoing efforts to identify the remains of the victims, as stated by the Netherlands Foreign Minister earlier, to date 225 out of a total of 298 victims have been identified. Of the 43 Malaysian victims, 40 have been identified and 35 of them have been repatriated to Malaysia.
On that note, I wish to extend the heartfelt appreciation of the people and the Government of Malaysia to the Dutch authorities for making that possible. As we speak, forensic experts are relentlessly undertaking the painstaking work of identifying the remaining victims, with a view to reuniting them with their loved ones as soon as possible.
Malaysia welcomes the preliminary report of the independent international investigation team led by the Dutch Safety Board, which was released just last week. Among other things, the report confirms that the aircraft was flying in unrestricted airspace, was following the route and flying at the altitude prescribed by the air traffic control authorities. The report also confirms that the aircraft was in an airworthy condition at departure. There were no indications of any technical problems or actions by the crew that could have contributed to the crash. The report also concludes that the aircraft was hit by a large number of high-energy objects that pierced it from the outside, causing the aircraft to disintegrate in the air.
The findings of the report notwithstanding, crucial questions remain unanswered, including the following. Who was responsible for the downing of the aircraft? What exactly happened when communications between Flight MH-17 and the air traffic controllers stopped abruptly at 13.20 hours on 17 July?
In the light of such lingering questions, last week Malaysia dispatched a high-level delegation, led by its Defence Minister, to Ukraine, Russia and the Netherlands to further explore the possibility of affording the international investigation team safe and unfettered access to the crash site. Malaysia wishes to inform the Council that it has secured renewed commitment and assurances from the Governments of Ukraine and Russia to assist in facilitating safe passage to the wreckage area. We hope that such assurances will be translated into concrete action as soon as possible.
Time is of the essence. The approaching winter could severely hamper recovery and investigation efforts. Malaysia will not rest until justice is done. It would be totally unacceptable for the families and loved ones of the victims to experience the unimaginable pain of losing their loved ones, only to learn that the perpetrators might not be held to account due to our inaction. The international community owes it to the victims’ families and loved ones to ensure that those responsible for this heinous crime be swiftly brought to justice. We need to cooperate fully to establish accountability for the perpetrators of this crime. I strongly reiterate the importance of transparency, impartiality and thoroughness in the conduct of the investigation to ensure that the truth prevails.",,,"In August, many of us on the Council had an opportunity to visit the memorial at Schiphol International Airport dedicated to the victims of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. No one can forget the haunting, powerful emotions expressed of love, loss and longing for those who perished, as Under-Secretary-General Feltman said, in somebody else’s war. I would like to take this opportunity to once again express my country’s heartfelt condolences to the families in the Netherlands, Malaysia, Australia, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, the Philippines, New Zealand and Canada who lost their loved ones in the downing of MH-17. As the Prime Minister of the Netherlands said,
“we owe it to the victims’ next of kin to do everything in our power ... to achieve clarity about the circumstances of this tragedy, and to bring those responsible to justice”.
Resolution 2166 (2014), adopted by the Council in response to the tragedy, demands a full, thorough and independent international investigation. It also demands that those responsible for the incident be held to account. We must ensure that the resolution is fully implemented. There can be no impunity for the perpetrators of this horrific crime.
Lithuania welcomes the preliminary findings of the independent investigation under the leadership of the Dutch Safety Board, with the participation of a dozen countries and agencies. The International Civil Aviation Organization was consulted to ensure that the investigation strictly complied with international standards and practices. As we know, the purpose of the investigation is to establish the facts, with the goal of ensuring the prevention of such accidents in future. It was not meant to assign blame or liability to any party, and it is still ongoing. We fully agree that any attempt to interfere with, influence or put pressure on the investigation are inappropriate and totally unacceptable. The international experts must be able to carry out their work free of political pressures or attempts to sway the results of the investigation.
We find it incomprehensible that there should be claims of a lack of transparency or of selectivity and bias in the investigation. The democratically elected Governments of the countries affected have a special responsibility to their citizens and the victims’ families to establish the truth. We have full confidence in their assessment of the investigation and their determination to proceed until justice is done. The Foreign Minister of the Netherlands and the representative of Australia could not have been clearer on this matter.
We reiterate our concern about the lack of access to the crash site, which is in the hands of pro-Russian insurgents. Time is running out. These illegal armed groups bear full responsibility for the successful completion of this investigation, and for providing full, unhindered, immediate access to the evidence and remains that are still in the field.
While Russia is trying to cast doubt on the integrity of the investigation, the creeping invasion of Ukraine continues. Nearly 400 incidents of violation by the insurgents of the ceasefire regime have been registered since it came into effect. How could investigators return to the site? Reports of lawlessness, extrajudicial executions and systematic human rights violations in the rebel-held areas abound. Russian aid convoys come and go as they please across a sovereign country’s borders. We have become so inured to such violations of Ukraine’s borders, sovereignty and territorial integrity that they barely make it into the news. Russian soldiers fight against Ukraine on Ukraine’s soil, while those who investigate their deaths are attacked and intimidated. Their mothers deny the truth about the circumstances of their death.
The situation of Crimean Tartars, for whom Crimea is the only place they can call their homeland, continues to deteriorate. They are being increasingly prosecuted, their homes raided, documents seized, their leaders banned from returning home, their Mejlis impounded, offices closed down, property confiscated. While Ukraine’s Government is offering amnesty to the rebels and extensive autonomy to its eastern regions, self-proclaimed leaders of the illegal armed groups insist on fighting to the end.
Those are only some of the inconvenient truths that should be gleaned through the smokescreen of Russia’s concerns about the investigation.
An undeclared war against the sovereign State of Ukraine is at the root of the tragedy of Flight MH-17. The ultimate responsibility for the tragic loss of nearly 300 passenger lives as well as for the massive destruction, death and displacement of the population in eastern Ukraine lies with those who, driven by the dangerous ambition to redraw the borders of modern Europe, continue to fuel that war in spite of the ceasefire and the various agreements achieved.
The people of Ukraine, whose unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable, have the right to determine their future without any foreign interference. The people of Ukraine have made their choice, and Russia’s continued aggression will only reinforce that choice. As I was listening to the representatives of the countries affected, what struck me basically was that every single country affected that has lost its citizens and whose people are waiting for justice and closure has expressed its full support for the Netherlands-led investigation. Not a single country has raised doubts about that investigation or claimed that its integrity is flawed. Therefore, I find it extremely surprising that countries that have very direct stakes in the investigation are satisfied with its course, while somebody who has no stake in the investigation or seemingly no stake in the investigation is spreading doubts and openly questioning the credibility and integrity of the investigation. That probably says something about their true motives, but I will not speculate on those motives. I think we have to be very careful, honestly speaking, about how we proceed with the debate.
Behind the investigation, we have real people, real names. We have those who have lost their dear ones. They want clarity, they want closure. They want justice. Obfuscations and claims that the investigation is flawed and that there has to be another investigation and that there has to be assistance hurts those people and puts them in doubt. That is not what we, as the Council, can allow. We should not add additional grief to those who already lost their dear ones.
Therefore, I think that any speculation on the process and on the credibility of the investigation and attempts to raise additional questions and establish additional structures, which will encumber the process, is, as our German colleague said when speaking about something else, “a slap in the face”. It is damaging to the memory of the people and to the course of justice. And justice, I think, is what we all want in this case. ","I thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing.
We commend the collaborative work of the Dutch-led international team of air safety investigators. They have been very successful in rendering the preliminary report on the downing of Flight MH-17 in spite of the formidable challenges of a difficult security environment. We believe that further investigation into the crash will provide even greater insight into the sequence of events leading to the accident and offer a more conclusive outcome. That is essential for the elimination of doubt and conjecture, and in our view, will provide the basis for accountability and justice in consonance with the provisions of resolution 2166 (2014).
More significantly, we encourage the parties to be unrelenting in the search for a mutually acceptable solution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine. With President Poroshenko’s concession of self-rule and amnesty to the separatists, we are optimistic that the conditions on the ground will improve sufficiently to enable a thorough, transparent and unimpeded investigation. What is required now is restraint and perseverance by all parties concerned to advance the process to a logical conclusion. That is what the international community owes to the memory of the victims of the ill-fated flight MH-17.","We would like to wholeheartedly thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for his valuable briefing on the preliminary report on the crash of MH-17. We would also like to welcome the presence of Mr. Franciscus Timmermans, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, at this meeting and thank him for his valuable briefing.
Jordan would like to express its appreciation to the Dutch authorities for their efforts in investigating the MH-17 crash in eastern Ukraine and in drafting the preliminary report on the incident. The technical findings make clear that the aircraft was struck from the outside by a missile and that further investigations must be carried out to know who is responsible for launching the missile and whether or not the launching was deliberate. Many other questions must be answered. We therefore stress the need to continue the investigations in order to arrive at a definitive understanding and to prepare the final report.
In that regard, we call on all parties to cooperate and to allow unfettered access to the crash site so that the investigation may be completed and the parties responsible for the crash may be identified, brought to justice at the international leve and held accountable for their criminal act. This issue should be given priority because any complacency will result in direct consequences for the safety and security of civil aviation and would encourage targeting flights in different parts of the world. The investigation is a legal matter and should not be viewed or addressed as a way to achieve political advantages by any party.
Jordan welcomes the ceasefire agreed at a meeting of the contact group in Minsk on 5 September, and in particular its provisions on the importance of continued national dialogue over the release of all prisoners, the withdrawal of illegitimate armed groups and the disarming of those groups. In that context, we urge all armed groups to respect the conditions and provisions of the ceasefire to end to the violence and show credibility in the implementation of its provisions. We would also like to stress Ukraine’s right to its sovereignty, territorial integrity and stability.
We would like to stress once again the importance of a political and diplomatic solution to the crisis. We do not believe that a military solution is the means to realize peace and security. Rather, it would lead to destruction, division, social disintegration and an exacerbation of the humanitarian, economic and political situation in the Ukraine. Guaranteeing the rights of all the citizens of Ukraine, including the rights of minorities, is the only way to bring about an honourable exit from the crisis.
We call on the Ukrainian Government to develop sustainable solutions that respond to the legitimate demands of all groups. We call on all parties to assist Ukraine in implementing political, legal and social reforms and to work on enacting a sustainable ceasefire so that we can agree to and arrive at a sustainable solution.","We thank the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, for his briefing and we appreciate the work that the Secretary-General continues to do to shed light on the facts surrounding the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH-17. We are also grateful for the work carried out by the Dutch Safety Board, as well as the valuable contributions of all countries who have provided human and technical support for the investigation.
Two months after the downing of the aeroplane, my delegation reaffirms the unequivocal message of resolution 2166 (2014) on the need for a full, thorough and independent international investigation to be carried out in accordance with international law. Chile notes that the provisions of the Security Council are starting to pay off with the issuance of this preliminary report. Along with highlighting its findings, we urge the Board to proceed to gather more background information to allow it establish the truth of what happened on 17 July. In particular, we need to know what kind of projectile hit the Malaysian Airlines aeroplane and what are its characteristics to make it possible to trace the object and determine, definitively, who are responsible for that heinous attack on civilians. We also hope that the Council will remain seized of this matter.
We appreciate that the legislative measures adopted by Ukraine, within the framework of dialogue with the separatist groups in the east and the ceasefire, do not include an amnesty for those responsible for the MH-17 disaster. The family members of the victims have the right to know the truth. Once again, we urge all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate actively with the relevant authorities.
Finally, we call upon the parties involved in the conflict in Ukraine to allow unrestricted access and ensure safety for as long as is needed by the investigators at the disaster site so that they can continue with and further develop their investigation. We hope that the ceasefire between the Government of Ukraine and the armed groups that control the area where the disaster occurred will provide the conditions necessary for the continuation of the investigation.","I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing. I welcome the presence of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, Australia, Luxembourg and Malaysia at this meeting. I would also like to thank the international team for its work and expertise on the Dutch investigation.
We take note of the fact that the information in the report is preliminary and that the information and results may be subject to change if additional evidence emerges. First, we welcome the work being done in searching for and identifying the bodies of the victims, and hope that the work is concluding so that the bodies may be returned to the families for dignified burial. However, we also note that the report indicates that the damage to the airliner suggests that it was penetrated from the outside by a large number of high-energy objects. In that regard, we urge that the investigation continue so that those responsible can be identified and the victims compensated. It is time for justice to be done. Since our last meeting on this matter (S/PV.7253), in August, we note that the parties have made efforts to ensure security at the crash site and the integrity of the area, so that investigations pursuant to resolution 2166 (2014) can continue.
The progress made in this area contrasts with the political and security situation in Ukraine, particularly in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east. In spite of President Poroshenko’s peace plan of 16 September, which included a ceasefire, we are informed that the ceasefire is continually being violated on the ground, with hundreds of civilian and military every day. We welcome the spirit of compromise shown by the Ukrainian Government in the Verkhovna Rada’s vote on 16 September on a special statute giving the Donetsk and Luhansk region more autonomy and independence, as well as a conditional amnesty for combatants in the eastern part of the country.
In conclusion, we urge the parties to the conflict to act with restraint in order to seek a political solution to the crisis, which should be achieved through direct, inclusive dialogue that respects the territorial integrity and sovereignty of a unified Ukraine, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.","I thank Mr. Feltman and Foreign Minister Timmermans for their briefings. I extend Australia’s deep gratitude for the professionalism and empathy that the Netherlands has shown in responding to this terrible incident. I particularly thank Minister Timmermans for his personal commitment and compassion and Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Aman for his vital contribution to the recovery efforts. We welcome their presence here today.
Almost two months ago, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 2166 (2014) (see S/PV.7221). Its vote that day reflected the outrage of the international community in response to the shooting down of a commercial aircraft in commercial airspace over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 passengers and crew. Resolution 2166 (2014) voiced our collective condemnation of that horrific act and our determination to hold those responsible to account. The resolution expresses full support for a thorough and independent international investigation into the atrocity, in accordance with international civil aviation guidelines. We demanded that armed groups in control of the crash site refrain from any actions that may compromise the integrity of the site and provide safe, secure, full and unrestricted access to the appropriate investigating authorities. At that time, I called on Russia to use its influence over those armed groups in control of the crash site to allow full and safe access for the recovery of remains and personal belongings and investigation efforts.
Within days of the downing, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Ukraine agreed to a Dutch-led investigation that would meet the International Civil Aviation Organization’s guidelines, namely, an independent investigation with broad international participation, drawing upon experts from Australia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Russia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as the European Aviation Safety Agency and the International Civil Aviation Organization.
Ukraine moved quickly to provide support for recovery efforts at the crash site despite the ongoing conflict, with the actions of armed separatists restricting and, at times, preventing access to the site. Due to Ukraine’s efforts to comply with its obligations under resolution 2166 (2014), Dutch, Australian and Malaysian experts were able to spend six days in late July searching the crash site. Our experts did a remarkable job, carrying out their demanding forensic work in the midst of a conflict zone.
That international team, supported by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), was able to access areas of the crash site that had not previously been searched and to recover remains and a substantial number of personal effects belonging to those on board Flight MH-17. In the end, the security conditions became too dangerous to continue and the external destabilization of eastern Ukraine intensified. However, those efforts resulted in the collection of invaluable evidence to support an effective investigation.
I acknowledge the efforts of the Dutch Government in coordinating the dignified repatriation of the victims of Flight MH-17 to Eindhoven Air Base. That gave some comfort to the grieving families. I commend the Dutch Government’s strong leadership of the criminal investigation. The authorities in the Netherlands have worked painstakingly to identify the victims. As of today, 19 September, 225 victims have now been identified by the identification commission in The Hague, including a number of Australians. Substantial progress has been made, but the identification process has been slow given the circumstances of the crash. That is no consolation to the families and friends from around the world, including from Australia, who are grieving the loss of their loved ones and are yet to bring them home.
Australia welcomes the release on 9 September of the preliminary report of the Dutch Safety Board. The first official account of the tragedy was prepared in strict accordance with the International Civil Aviation Organization guidelines. The report draws on data from the black boxes, satellite imagery and photos from the crash site. Its findings are based on an objective analysis of the available evidence. That is vital for a transparent and accountable investigation. It is a welcome step forward in achieving the full, thorough and independent international investigation demanded by resolution 2166 (2014).
In accordance with annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the preliminary report does not attribute blame or liability for the incident. That is the role of the multinational criminal investigation currently under way, led by the Dutch Public Prosecution Service. Lest there be any misunderstanding, I reiterate that that is the domain of the criminal investigation.
The Australian Government’s initial assessment was that Flight MH-17 had been shot down by a surface-to-air missile. The preliminary report has not stated any conclusions but the aircraft damage shown in the report is certainly consistent with our view. We continue to demand that international investigators be allowed to return safely to the crash site of Flight MH-17, consistent with resolution 2166 (2014). Australia is committed to returning to the site, once it is safe to do so, in the company of our Dutch and Malaysian partners.
We are deeply concerned by reports that OSCE observers were gravely endangered during the course of a recently agreed monitoring mission. The observers were shelled en route to the site and later threatened with violence by armed groups. Such incidents show that it is still unsafe to return to the site. Let me be clear. The security situation around the site and in much of eastern Ukraine has deteriorated because of Russian support to armed separatist groups. That support continues. It must cease.
In adopting resolution 2166 (2014), the Council demanded unanimously that those responsible for the atrocity be held to account. The international community and, above all, the victims’ families, expect that this will happen, and this must happen. Russia called for a transparent and accountable investigation. Russia is participating in it now. The Under-Secretary-General said that the United Nations was confident that the investigation was being conducted in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization guidelines. Those are the very guidelines that the international community has carefully established to ensure an objective investigation.
I point out that resolution 2166 (2014) does not create the investigation; it supports the need for an investigation, for an investigation is automatically required under the Chicago Convention. Through resolution 2166 (2014), the Council supports that independent international investigation. We demanded integrity. We wanted access to the site — unrestricted, full access to the site — and a cessation of violence.
It is in Russia’s power to call off the separatists so that we have access to the site. Let us get on with it. Give the independent investigators access to the site. The Netherlands, Malaysia and Australia stand ready to return to the site, give comfort to the grieving families and allow the investigation to continue. It is established, it is independent — the United Nations says it is — the other countries involved have given support, so we call on Russia to enable the investigation to continue by ensuring that the ceasefire is maintained and that we can have secure, safe access to the site.","Canada welcomes the preliminary report released on 9 September by the Dutch Safety Board and commends the investigation team, whose work has been exemplary despite the difficulties that they encountered in pursuing their important task. The report was prepared despite the initial efforts of the Russian-backed insurgents in control of the area to hinder the work of the investigation and despite the limited access to the crash site due to the violence caused by the insurgents.
(spoke in English)
As we now know, the investigation has found no evidence of problems with the aircraft or with the crew before the tragedy. Its findings are consistent with what we and others have asserted since the tragedy on 17 July, namely, that the flight was destroyed by an anti-aircraft missile following an increased flow of heavy weaponry, including rocket launchers, from Russia into insurgent-controlled areas in Ukraine.
The tragedy is but one of many examples of the cost of Russia’s reckless behaviour in Ukraine, where more than 3,000 people have died since Russian-sponsored violence erupted in April. Its actions there undermine the most basic norms of international conduct. They pose a grave threat not only to the security of eastern Europe but also to the rules-based international system.
The Russian Federation can end the ongoing tragedy in Ukraine. We support the ceasefire agreement reached on 5 September and commend the Government of Ukraine for acting on its commitments to secure lasting peace. Russia and the insurgents must begin acting in good faith and do the same. The task of the Flight MH-17 investigation team is not yet complete. We look forward to its final report, as well as to the outcome of the work also under way within the International Civil Aviation Organization. The need for answers and justice and respect for the victims and their grieving friends and family members from all the countries affected, including Canada, should unite all Member States in support of those efforts.
In July, we joined others in sponsoring resolution 2166 (2014). Today, we call once again on Russia and the insurgents to allow access to the crash site. We reiterate the need for those responsible for the tragedy to be brought to justice. As we continue to mourn the victims, Canada stands ready to contribute further to the investigation.",,,"I would like to thank you, Madam President, for convening this emergency meeting. I also wish to thank Mr. Feltman, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, for his briefing on the preliminary report of the Dutch Safety Board on the investigation into the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17.
We welcome the statement delivered by His Excellency Mr. Frans Timmermans, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and we acknowledge the important leadership of his country in the investigation. We also acknowledge the presence among us of Her Excellency Ms. Julie Bishop, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia, and His Excellency Mr. Jean Asselborn, Minister for Foreign and European Affairs of Luxembourg.
We have taken note of the preliminary findings of the investigation. We consider them to be an important step towards the implementation of resolution 2166 (2014). According to the report, damage observed in the forward section of the aircraft appears to indicate that it was penetrated by large, high-energy objects from outside the aircraft. There is now little doubt that it was indeed shot down.
We deplore the fact that, two months after the crash, all the remains of the victims were not recovered. However, we commend the investigators on the ground for identifying most of the victims. We hope that all the countries concerned will continue to cooperate with the investigation to ensure that all victims are recovered, identified and brought home for proper burial.
Although the purpose of this report was not to apportion blame or liability in respect of any party, it is important that criminal investigations be carried out expeditiously to establish the perpetrators. As we look forward to the final findings of the investigation, it is important to remind ourselves that what the families of the 298 victims expect from the investigators and from the international community as a whole is to name the perpetrators and hold them accountable, in line with paragraph 11 of resolution 2166 (2014). In that regard, we welcome the launch of a criminal investigation by the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service in close cooperation with the investigation and prosecution authorities of the affected countries.
I want to welcome the signing, on 5 September, of the Minsk protocol agreement, under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine. We regret, however, the continued reports of ceasefire violations by the warring parties. Other than security, human rights and humanitarian consequences, the fighting continues to hamper the work of the investigations team, and nothing can guarantee that all the necessary evidence will be found more than two months after the crash.
In the same vein, we deplore the fact that, due to resumption of the fighting, the lives of OSCE monitors were put in danger as they were caught in crossfire and threatened by armed separatists. We therefore reiterate our call to the parties concerned to cease hostilities in conformity with the agreement and in accordance with paragraph 7 of resolution 2166 (2014), by which the Council demands that all military activities, including by armed groups, immediately cease in the immediate areas surrounding the crash site to allow for the security and safety of the international investigation.
To conclude, Rwanda once again urges the armed separatists to lay down their arms, respect the independence, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and engage constructively with the Ukrainian Government, which, with the proposed amnesty and self-governance bill to separatist-held areas, has demonstrated goodwill to finding a political settlement to this crisis.","I thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing on the situation in Ukraine and the preliminary report published by the Dutch Safety Board on the tragic incident of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. We also extend our thanks to and acknowledge the leadership of the Netherlands through Foreign Minister Franciscus Timmermans, whom we welcome to the Security Council.
Argentina supported and co-sponsored resolution 2166 (2014) adopted on 21 July, in which the Security Council, highlighting the need for a full, thorough and independent international investigation into the incident, recognized the efforts to undertake an international investigation of the incident. In that context, we welcome the briefing on the preliminary report on the investigation of the incident coordinated by the Dutch Safety Board, in which experts from the International Civil Aviation Organization, the European Aviation Safety Agency and concerned Member States took part. We take note of the preliminary conclusions and await the presentation of the final report with interest. We hope those conclusions will enable us to determine unequivocally and objectively what led to the downing of the plane. It is also important that the possibility that there is criminal responsibility for this be clarified, and if that should be the case, that those responsible be held accountable for their actions to the full extent of the law. In order to ensure that the investigation can continue to progress, safe, full and unhindered access to the site of the crash must be guaranteed.
The downing of Flight MH-17 took place against a backdrop of fighting between Ukraine and armed groups, and it is believable that if the circumstances had been different, the story would also have been different. Argentina is very concerned about the deterioration of the security and human rights situations in eastern and southern Ukraine, and about the effects of renewed violence on the civilian population. We emphasize the importance of finding a peaceful solution to the difficult situation Ukraine is dealing with through dialogue and negotiation. For that reason we take a positive view of the memorandum of understanding between Ukraine, Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. However, we must acknowledge that we are concerned about the fragility of the ceasefire that has been achieved so far. Given the difficulty in reaching the agreement, we insist that there can be no peaceful solution to Ukraine’s difficult situation through any unilateral acts, and we therefore call on all parties to implement the measures agreed on in the memorandum. The only possible settlement can be one reached through dialogue and negotiation, with due respect for Ukraine’s autonomy in handling its domestic affairs and avoiding any confrontational rhetoric or intervention in a State’s internal affairs, whether political, military or economic. The parties must respect human rights and international humanitarian law without exceptions, and must guarantee due accountability for any violations or abuse of them.","I thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for his presentation. I thank my friend and colleague Franciscus Timmermans, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, for the information he provided. I salute his commitment and that of Ms. Julie Bishop, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia, and Mr. Anifah Aman, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malaysia.
In adopting resolution 2166 (2014), the Security Council condemned the destruction of the Malaysia Airlines aircraft in Ukraine, which resulted, as we know, in the tragic death of 298 people. The Council expressed deep sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims of that disaster. It is clear that the absolute priority was the repatriation of remains and identification of victims. It is essential to continue that work to enable the families and friends of all the victims to know with certainty the fate of their loved ones.
In resolution 2166 (2014), the Security Council called for a comprehensive, thorough and independent international investigation into the accident in accordance with international civil aviation guidelines. The conduct of that investigation has been delegated by Ukraine to the Netherlands. We have full confidence in the investigation by the Dutch Safety Board, in cooperation with international experts of the International Civil Aviation Organization and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Chicago Convention. We welcome the serious and independent work of by the Board that led to the publication, on 9 September 2014, of an interim report containing the first results of the investigation.
We regret that illegal armed groups have hindered access to the crash site in the days following the tragedy. That has wasted valuable time and made the investigation more difficult. We also regret that the work of the investigators on the site was suspended on 6 August due to the deteriorating security situation. Armed groups that control the site of the accident and the surrounding area must permit the investigation to resume without delay, giving full, safe and unhindered access to investigators. That is a key provision of resolution 2166 (2014). It is encouraging to see that Russia is also insistently demanding the same thing, as the representative of the Russian Federation has just stated, and that it too is thus working in that direction.
Those who shot down Flight MH-17, those responsible for this heinous act, will be held accountable. Indeed, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights highlighted on 28 July the fact that this act could constitute a war crime. We welcome the work by the courts of the affected countries that have opened criminal investigations. All Member States must be fully involved in the efforts to establish responsibility for the tragedy. We owe it to the victims and their families, for justice to be done, as was just energetically highlighted by Frans Timmermans.
Let me conclude by emphasizing the urgency of ending the conflict in Ukraine. Its tally in terms of lives lost is overwhelming. More than 3,000 people have died in eastern Ukraine since the conflict began. Repeated attacks against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine by pro-Russian separatists and their external supporters claim new victims every day.
The conclusion of a fragile ceasefire on 5 September was a step in the right direction. Under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, talks are ongoing within the trilateral contact group, but we must now redouble our efforts. We are encouraged by the concrete steps taken by the President and Government of Ukraine to implement the commitments undertaken in Minsk. It is high time that the illegal armed groups to respect their own and withdraw from the territory of Ukraine, as was agreed in Minsk.","I thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing. We also welcome the Foreign Ministers of the Netherlands, Australia, Luxembourg and Malaysia to the Security Council.
By adopting resolution 2166 (2014) on the tragic downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, the Security Council asserted with one voice that we must ensure that the tragedy is fully investigated. In that regard, the Republic of Korea welcomes the preliminary report of the international investigation team. We especially appreciate the Government of the Netherlands, the International Civil Aviation Organization and all the independent international experts who have worked on the investigation. We have full confidence in those experts’ credibility and independence in carrying out their duties.
We take this opportunity once again to call attention to the importance of establishing the solid facts and bringing those responsible to justice. In order to shed full light on the tragic event, the investigation team must gain safe access to the crash site once again and complete its work. We further hope that the horrible incident leads to collective efforts to reinforce the current regime for the safety and security of civil aviation.
With the important elections scheduled in October, we would like to reiterate that an inclusive political process is the essential foundation for a stable and democratic future for all Ukrainian people. In that regard, we welcome the progressive steps made by the Ukrainian Government in implementing the provisions of the Minsk protocol. Notably, the draft law that grants special status to the eastern region is an important step towards a more inclusive political process, which we hope can provide a sound basis for the de-escalation of tensions.
In conclusion, we are encouraged by ongoing diplomatic efforts towards the stabilization of Ukraine, in particular those of the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union and other bilateral partners. We encourage all parties to continue such efforts to seek a peaceful political solution."
S/PV.7253,28/08/2014,Discussion of the escalation of the conflict in Donbas as well follow-up of the downing of MH-17,"I thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing. China is deeply concerned and worried about the continued worsening of the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine, which has caused great loss of life and property. In the current situation, all the parties concerned must exercise restraint so as not to escalate it further. China has stated on many occasions its principled position on the question of Ukraine. On this occasion, I will refrain from repeating it. I wish to emphasize the following. The crisis in Ukraine can be resolved only by political means. The priority now is for all the parties concerned to achieve a prompt ceasefire, persevere in efforts to promote a political resolution of the crisis in Ukraine, fully accommodate the legitimate rights, interests and aspirations of all regions and ethnic groups of Ukraine and take into full consideration the legitimate concerns of all parties, thereby achieving a balance of their interests. The international community should urge the parties concerned to make good use of various mechanisms for dialogue and liaison, increase communications and act in a manner that is conducive to mutual trust. China supports all efforts that would contribute to easing the situation, resolving the crisis and promoting a political solution. ","I too would like to thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing. The information coming to the Council from the ground is quite disturbing. The actions carried out by the separatists and the intensification of fighting in urban areas have brought about serious humanitarian consequences. Today we call upon all parties for restraint, to protect the civilian population and to respect international humanitarian law, bearing in mind the hundreds of thousands of terrorized and displaced persons. Russia’s support for the separatists, in violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, is inadmissible. The presence of Russian soldiers on Ukrainian territory and their direct participation alongside separatists in the taking of lives in Novoazovsk must not be tolerated. As the President of the French Republic recalled this morning, Russia must respect Ukraine’s sovereignty; it must halt its support to the separatists and call on them to accept a bilateral ceasefire. That is the framework in which a lasting political settlement must be sought, but Moscow must also agree to de-escalation measures. That presupposes the immediate halting of the delivery of military materiel to the separatists. It also assumes control along the Russian-Ukrainian border. On those issues we expect signs from Russia that will finally enable us to engage in a serious dialogue that benefits everyone. The prolongation or escalation of the conflict is not in the interests of Ukraine or Russia or the international community. Although the face-to-face meeting in Minsk between Mr. Poroshenko and Mr. Putin on 26 August led to few concrete results, it was a positive step in that it allowed for direct contacts between the two Presidents, after the 6 June meeting in Benouville. The Ukrainian crisis is one of the worst crises in Europe since the end of the Cold War. Our objective is to ultimately achieve a lasting political solution to this crisis, which has lasted for far too long. As long as Russia pursues escalation, it will not take the opportunity to resume political dialogue. We will therefore maintain the pressure. That is why the European Union adopted a substantial package of economic sanctions against Russia on 29 July. The sanctions will be maintained and will increase if the escalation continues. We hope it will not reach that point, as that is not in the interest of Russia or of anyone else. ","The current escalating situation in south- eastern Ukraine is a direct consequence of Kyiv’s reckless policy of waging war on its own people. With the support and under the influence of a number of well-known States, the Kyiv authorities have torpedoed all the political agreements for settling the crisis in Ukraine arrived at in the Geneva declaration of 17 April and the Berlin declaration of 2 July. Not to mention the authorities’ abandonment of their previous positions in the agreement of 21 February, which opened the door to a real possibility for a civilized way out of the crisis. President Poroshenko’s unilateral proposal for a so-called peace plan was also merely another step on the road to further escalation, since the truce was predicated on capitulation on the part of the insurgents. That is all against a backdrop with no real steps towards launching a political process or negotiating with representatives of the regions. Where is the inclusive national dialogue promised by Kyiv, the constitutional reform, the decentralization of authority and the special status for the Russian language? All we are seeing is a fight with dissenters and a situation in which political parties and media that do not toe the line are banned. President Poroshenko has frequently made peaceful-sounding statements. Only yesterday he commented on the results of the high-level meeting in Minsk, saying that Kyiv’s chief goal was peace, and that they sought decisive action capable of bringing peace to Ukraine. He also spoke of some new urgent plan for resolving the crisis. Where is that plan? Or is it yet another distracting manoeuvre while concealing an attempt to resolve things by force? We hope that the Kyiv leadership will not squander the positive opportunities presented by the Minsk meeting. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian armed forces, without consideration for any standard of international humanitarian law or simple moral precepts, have been indiscriminately attacking cities, residential neighbourhoods and infrastructure targets. They are using artillery, machine guns and air attacks, using phosphorous explosives banned under international conventions and ballistic rockets. In the so-called anti-terrorist operations area there are 4 million people. Hundreds of thousands of them have been sitting in cellars without water or electricity for weeks, and food and medicines are practically unobtainable. The overall number of deaths now exceeds 2,000, and it is growing exponentially. The number of people, including refugees, who have moved from Ukraine to Russia is now more than 814,000. The media are reporting horrendous losses in the Ukrainian army, confirmed by mass protests in Ukraine against mobilization. Hundreds of Ukrainian servicemen are ending up on Russian territory for various reasons. We give them food, water and medical treatment and send them back to Ukraine. We hope that the Kyiv authorities are treating the nine Russian paratroopers we have heard so much about in the past 24 hours just as humanely. However, it is reported that they were detained with their own documents and with unloaded weapons, which hardly resembles a diversion force in a conflict zone. Everyone knows that there are Russian volunteers in eastern Ukraine; no one conceals the fact. One could wish that there could be similar transparency in certain other countries. Let us hear what our American colleagues have to say about what dozens of American advisers are doing in the Ukrainian Defence Council building, or how many American mercenaries from so-called private military contractors are fighting thousands of kilometres from their shores. How come American weapon systems have shown up in the Ukrainian armed forces? Our American colleague asked an eloquent question — what message can Russia’s neighbours send? To my dear colleagues I say this. I would suggest that they send a message to Washington, D.C. : stop interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign State. Stop stirring up objectionable regimes. Limit your geopolitical ambitions. Then not only Russia’s neighbours but many other countries all over the world would breathe more easily. And another thing: stop speculating about the downed Malaysian plane. So far Russia alone has made a contribution to the conduct of a transparent and essential investigation of that tragedy. From everyone else we have heard no information, nothing but insinuations. For some reason, even the question of how the Ukrainians obtained recordings of their air traffic controllers’ conversations is some kind of dreadful secret. Stop that speculation. Russia has been attempting to send humanitarian aid to the residents of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions who so urgently need it. Not long ago, despite the desperate opposition of various intrigue-mongering members of the Security Council, the first Russian humanitarian convoy arrived in Luhansk under the auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Preparations are now being finalized for dispatching a second convoy. An agreement on that was confirmed today in a telephone conversation between Russia’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Sergey Lavrov, and Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Klimkin. We should remember that the Council does not exist in order to spread conjecture and exchange accusations, but to take decisions that might help to resolve crises. Today we propose that Council members make the following statement to the press: “The members of the Security Council expressed serious concern about the worsening situation in south-eastern Ukraine and called for a speedy and unconditional ceasefire. The members of the Security Council called for an inclusive political dialogue on Ukraine based on the Geneva declaration of 17 April 2014 and the joint Berlin declaration of 2 July 2014. In that context, the Council noted the role of the contact group and strongly urged that the process be resumed without delay within the framework of the contact group. “The members of the Security Council urged the international community to step up its efforts to provide humanitarian aid to the people of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine.” That is the end of the draft statement by the Security Council to the press. We propose that we vote on this statement here and now around this table. I would like to say a few words to our Ukrainian colleagues. First, as he did in a previous statement, hinting at Russia, the representative of Ukraine — just as the representative of the United States did — mentioned the Malaysia Airlines flight. Could he please tell the Council why Ukraine has not published the transcripts of the air traffic controllers’ converstations? Could he at least tell us if they have provided them to the Dutch authorities. Secondly, I should like to make a more substantial comment — and I understand that perhaps in Washington, D.C., or in Brussels they might not know about this, because for them it does not really matter whether it is Ukraine or some country in Latin America or Africa or wherever. But I am trying to understand. When they announced the so-called Poroshenko peace plan, which mentioned the need for insurgents to capitulate, did the politicians in Kyiv not understand the kind of consequences that could lead to? I do not understand this. I mean: we know our region. We know how close our ties are. That was an obvious step towards escalation and disaster, which is what we are seeing. Could they not understand that insurgents could not simply lay down their weapons, give up and leave for Russia and have Ukrainian tanks enter Luhansk and Donetsk? I do not understand. If someone had advised them to do this, then that person either did not understand what he was doing or was simply trying to provoke, trying to completely destabilize the situation in Ukraine and make life difficult for Russia. If the representative of Ukraine could provide an explanation for this, I would be very grateful. ","I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the United Kingdom. I thank Mr. Feltman for his briefing. The United Kingdom is deeply alarmed by the escalation of Russian military intervention in eastern Ukraine over the past 72 hours. Formed units of the armed forces of the Russian Federation are now directly engaged in fighting inside Ukraine against the armed forces of Ukraine. Those units consist of well over 1,000 regular Russian troops equipped with armoured vehicles, artillery and air defence systems. That incursion is a clear violation of sovereign Ukrainian territory by the Russian Federation. It is a clear breach of international law and a contravention of the Charter of the United Nations. Russian denials of that reality fit into the pattern of Russia’s dishonest approach to Ukraine from the very beginning of the crisis. We all remember that Russia denied that it had any extra military personnel on the ground in Crimea right up until its illegal annexation with military force. Russia has denied providing military support to the separatists. In fact, Russia has been transferring significant quantities of advanced weapons, including tanks, armoured personnel carriers and artillery, to separatist groups for several months. As of today, the separatists’ arsenal includes up to 100 main battle tanks, 80 armoured personnel carriers, 100 man-portable air defence systems, 500 anti-tank weapons and more than 100 artillery pieces. Almost all of those have been directly supplied by Russia since the conflict started. In the past three weeks, that support has increased significantly, no doubt in response to Ukraine’s success in liberating territory from the separatists. On 7 August, 50 vehicles, including tanks, armoured personnel carriers and BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launchers, crossed from Russia into Ukraine at the Chervono Partizansk border crossing. On 15 August, a convoy of 23 armoured personnel carriers crossed close to where the Russian humanitarian convoy was awaiting customs clearance. The following day, a further convoy of 84 military vehicles crossed the border. The evidence is overwhelming, and plenty of it comes from the Russian military itself. On 13 July, armoured vehicles flying Russian flags were photographed by a Russian serviceman crossing the Ukrainian border at Izvaryne, Donetsk. On 31 July, a Russian soldier posted photographs of himself operating military hardware inside Ukraine. His photographs included images of himself inside an SA-11 missile launch system — the very weapon that appears to have been used to shoot down Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. Russia has also denied that it has shelled Ukrainian territory. In fact, over just five days, between 14 and 19 August, Ukrainian armed forces were fired upon from positions inside Russian territory on at least 21 separate occasions, with weapons systems ranging from heavy mortars to Grad rockets. Now we see irrefutable evidence of regular Russian forces operating inside Ukraine. For some months, Russia has deployed small groups of its special forces operating under the command of the main intelligence directorate of the Russian armed forces in support of the separatists. Those forces have been responsible for coordinating attacks and facilitating communications and transfers of equipment and personnel. Their presence is clear from their communications. Over a single 24-hour period from 29 to 30 July alone, there were 45 separate instances of Russian secure military radio transmissions originating from inside Ukrainian territory. Today, NATO has released satellite imagery, taken on 21 and 23 August, of Russian self-propelled artillery units inside Ukraine in the vicinity of Krasnodon, Luhansk province. On Monday, 10 Russian paratroopers belonging to the 331st Regiment of the 98th Svirsk Airborne Division were captured near the village of Dzerkalne, 20 kilometres inside Ukrainian territory. We have satellite imagery confirming the deployment of Russian armoured vehicles supported by artillery south of Donetsk close to that location. Today, another Russian soldier, Petr Khokhlov, serving with the 9th Motor Rifle Brigade, was captured in Luhansk. It is simply not credible for Russia and its proxies in Donetsk and Luhansk to keep claiming that those serving members of the Russian armed forces are in Ukraine by accident or on holiday. Nor is it credible for Russia to continue claiming to the whole world, including to the Russian people, that Russian soldiers are not present on Ukrainian territory. The increasing number of Russian casualties and captured soldiers gives the lie to that. Russia can no longer pretend that it is not a direct party to this conflict. Indeed, this conflict would no longer exist without direct Russian military involvement in support of the separatists. President Putin has said that Russia is willing to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. Those words have little value against this clear pattern of escalating Russian military involvement in eastern Ukraine. Violating international law and the Charter of the United Nations in such a brazen manner is not compatible with Russia’s responsibilities as a permanent member of the Security Council. We again call on Russia to immediately withdraw its military forces from Ukraine, stop its flow of weapons to the separatists and instead help to secure a political solution to the crisis. I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council. ","This is our twenty-fourth meeting to try to rein in Russia’s aggressive acts in Ukraine. Every single one of those meetings has sent a straight-forward, unified message: Russia, stop this conflict. Russia is not listening. We said it when Russia flagrantly violated international law by occupying Crimea. We said it after the shocking downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, which took the lives of innocent men, women, children and infants from 11 countries. And we say it today, as Russia’s soldiers, tanks, air defence and artillery support fight alongside separatists and open a new front in a crisis manufactured in and fuelled by Russia. But Russia is not listening. Instead of listening, instead of heeding the demands of the international community and the rules of the international order, at every step Russia has come before the Council to say everything except the truth. It has manipulated. It has obfuscated. It has outright lied. We have therefore learned to measure Russia by its actions and not by its words. In the last 48 hours, Russia’s actions have spoken volumes. On 26 August — just this past Tuesday — after meeting with Ukrainian President Poroshenko in Minsk, President Putin spoke of the need to “end bloodshed as soon as possible”. Yet the same day satellite imagery showed Russian combat units south-east of Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine. That same day in Luhansk, Ukraine detained regular Russian army personnel from the 9th Brigade. In response, Russia claimed that the soldiers had wandered into Ukrainian territory by mistake. That, supposedly, in a time of conflict along one of the most carefully watched borders in the world. The day after the Minsk talks, Russia fired Grad rockets from inside Russia at Ukrainian positions in Novoazovsk and then attacked with two columns of Russian armoured vehicles and tanks. Russian armoured vehicles and Uragan multiple rocket launchers are positioned on the outskirts of that town as we speak. Russia’s force along the border is the largest it has been since it began redeploying forces there in late May, and includes significant numbers of combat aircraft and helicopters. Russian unmanned aircraft routinely cross into Ukrainian airspace. Other Russian deployments into Ukrainian territory include advanced artillery and air-defence systems not found in the Ukrainian inventory. Those artillery systems have shelled Ukrainian positions outside Luhansk city in conjunction with the recent separatist counteroffensive. One of the separatist leaders that Russia has armed and backed said openly that 3,000 or 4,000 Russian soldiers had joined their cause. He was quick to clarify that those soldiers were on vacation. But a Russian soldier who chooses to fight in Ukraine on his summer break is still a Russian soldier, and the armoured Russian military vehicle he drives there is not his personal car. Meanwhile, in Russia, family members of Russian soldiers are holding funerals for their loved ones who have been killed in the fighting in Ukraine. They are demanding answers about how their loved ones were killed. Journalists who try to cover the funerals are being harassed and threatened by armed men. Yet still, according to the Russian Government, the soldiers were never there. They were never in Crimea either, until Russia announced that those soldiers who were never there had annexed Crimea. The last 48 hours fit into a well-established pattern for Russia. Each step has paved the way for the one that followed. And yet, in spite of all of those outrageous actions, Ukraine has repeatedly sought a political solution to the crisis. It has repeatedly sought a path to de-escalation. Despite the pattern, President Poroshenko showed up in Minsk to meet with President Putin. In contrast, President Putin was still unwilling acknowledge the most basic facts, facts that we all know, namely, that Russia has armed, equipped and now joined illegal separatists fighting in Ukraine. Serious negotiations are needed — urgently needed — but Russia has to stop lying and has to stop fuelling the conf lict. The mask is coming off. In its recent acts, we see Russia’s actions for what they are: a deliberate effort to support and now fight alongside illegal separatists in another sovereign country. Russia has claimed that Ukraine is not interested in a ceasefire. But let us be clear: Ukraine has every interest in a ceasefire, as do we, as long as it a real one. But Russian separatists not only have no interest in observing a ceasefire, they cynically use the time to rearm and wait for additional soldiers and supplies to flow across the border from Russia. In the face of those deeply alarming actions, the most important question for us now is not what we should say to Russia; rather, the most important question is what we should do to make Russia listen. Throughout the crisis, the United States has, in close coordination with our European partners — the European Union and the group of seven (G-7), exerted targeted, effective pressure so that the message is heard, so that Russia begins to de-escalate rather than escalate and so that the reasonable peace plan put forward by President Poroshenko is adopted and implemented. In the face of Russia’s continued aggression and blatant disregard for the Charter of the United Nations and the Helsinki Final Act, we will continue to work closely with our G-7 and European partners to ratchet up the consequences on Russia. I understand that there are real costs felt by citizens of countries when their Governments take such actions. It has costs for businesses that trade with Russia and sell to Russian markets, from small-scale farmers to big factories. Those costs are considerable, and nobody should take them lightly. But let us be clear: if unchecked, the damage that Russia’s blatant disregard for the international order poses is much, much greater. Those rules and principles have taken generations to build, with unparalleled investment — countless lives have been lost in the process of establishing and defending those principles, and every single one of us has a stake in defending them. A threat to the order — the international order — is a threat to the peace and security of all of us. Those are the rules that Russia is flouting when it illegally seizes territory and when it arms, equips and fights alongside illegal groups in neighbouring countries. Ukraine is one of roughly a dozen countries that share a border with Russia. Let me conclude with a couple of questions. How can we tell those countries that border Russia that their peace and sovereignty is guaranteed, if we do not make our message heard on Ukraine? Why should they believe that it will be different, if tomorrow President Putin decides to start supporting armed separatists and allowing soldiers on vacation to fight in their countries? And, just as important, what message are we sending to other countries with similarly alarming ambitions around the world, when we let Russia violate the rules without sufficient consequences? In the face of that threat, the cost of inaction is unacceptable. ",,,,,,,,,,,"I would like to thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing earlier today.
It has already been half a year since the Council, on 28 February, first took up the issue of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine (see S/PV.7123). The aggression started through the military occupation and annexation of a huge part of Ukrainian sovereign territory, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. It then proceeded by means of a hybrid war against Ukraine, the sponsorship of terrorism and the supply of arms and mercenaries to illegal armed groups in the eastern region of our State, along with intensive artillery shelling from Russian territory and regular violations of Ukrainian air space by military aircraft, helicopters and drones. That was followed by the downing of a civilian aircraft by terrorist groups using Russian-supplied surface-to-air missile systems, killing all 298 passengers and crew on board. The next red line was the illegal crossing of the Ukrainian State border by a so-called humanitarian convoy dispatched by Russia without authorization from the Ukrainian Government and in violation of international agreements and procedures.
Russia has been putting its troops along the border with Ukraine. As of now, over 45,000 military, about 160 tanks, 1,360 armoured battle vehicles, 390 artillery systems, 150 Grad missile systems, 192 military aircraft and 137 helicopters are deployed in the vicinity of our border.
The situation has dramatically changed now. Russia has launched a direct military invasion of Ukraine with its regular armed forces. Last night, two military convoys crossed the Ukrainian State border and advanced towards the village of Telmanove with seven tanks, one BMP-2 and a truck with soldiers, and towards the town of Novoazovsk with five T-64 tanks, two BMP-2s, and two trucks with soldiers. After shelling the positions of Ukrainian forces from Russian territory and from the district of Sjedove, Russian troops seized Novoazovsk.
More than 10,000 civilians have been held hostage by the Russian invaders. Psychological pressure is exerted against the citizens of Ukraine, and threats of psychological violence are heard.
On 24 August, two battalion tactical groups from the armed forces of the Russian Federation, reinforced by tank units, crossed the State border of Ukraine near the village of Berestovo in the Donetsk region, just 500 metres from the Ukrainian State border. It was reported that none of the Russian military equipment bore license plates and that some combat vehicles were painted with two white stripes to resemble Ukrainian combat vehicles in a counter-terrorism operation zone. The troops wore Russian army combat uniforms without insignia. Currently, the combat units I have mentioned occupy several villages in the Donetsk region, including Pobeda, Glinka, Amvrosiivka, Telmanovo, Granitny and Sontseve, and are constructing fortified strongholds.
On 25 August, Ukrainian armed forces detained 10 soldiers near the town of Dzerkalne from the 331st Regiment of the 98th Sibirsk Airborne Division of the armed forces of the Russian Federation. All their identities were revealed. We have serious doubts that fully armed Russian troops could have lost their way and penetrated 25 kilometres into Ukraine. We possess abundant evidence, including video footage of troops and Russian soldiers now in detention, as well as Russian armoured vehicles and tanks with full documentation proving that they belong to the Russian military. That leaves absolutely no doubt about the direct Russian invasion of Ukraine.
We consider the Russian Federation fully responsible for the daily death toll among Ukrainian civilians and military as well as for the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Donbas. We demand that the Russian Federation immediately withdraw all its troops from Ukrainian territory to save the lives of both Ukrainians and Russians. We demand that the Russian Federation establish effective control over the Ukrainian-Russian border under the control of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which would exclude illegal supplies of military equipment, weapons and militants to Ukraine. We demand that Russia release all Ukrainians who are being held hostage. We have been open to all diplomatic initiatives and have participated in every negotiation format. The President of Ukraine has offered his peace plan for descalation, which Russia has deliberately undermined.
While demonstrating his full readiness for peace negotiations with Russia during their meeting in Minsk, President Poroshenko made it clear that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the European aspirations of the Ukrainian people, were not negotiable. In view of the open Russian military aggression, Ukraine reserves its right to act in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, which empowers every State Member of the United Nations with the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations. We call upon the international community to provide effective assistance to Ukraine to resist Russian aggression.
Will the international community keep witnessing silently as the fundamental principles of international law are being grossly disrespected? The entire democratic world is being challenged, and the actual world order is being destroyed. Or will it finally speak with one voice and act? The choice is not tactical; the choice is fundamental. The world is challenged by a military nuclear might that is ignoring universal principles and craves absolute power. How many more red lines have to be crossed before this challenge is addressed?
We call upon the Council to fulfil its Charter responsibility and take urgent measures to stop the aggression against a sovereign State Member of the United Nations. I wish to thank the representative of the Russian Federation for his questions. With regard to his first question, I can tell him decisively that Ukraine is participating actively in the work of the intergovernmental commission investigating the incident. My Government is cooperating in good faith with its international partners. I believe that a report on the Commission’s work and the initial findings of the investigation is to be published in the near future.
As for the Russian representative’s second question, I would like to say the following. Our President, including at the meeting with the Russian President in Minsk, has spoken clearly of our readiness for further dialogue in resolving the situation in eastern Ukraine. It was clearly stated that we are ready to engage in negotiations on a whole range of issues. The only topic that cannot be discussed is the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and our European integration, which is what our people desire and have decided upon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I thank you, Mr. President, for convening this urgent meeting. Let us be clear: weapons do not fall into the hands of rebels out of the blue sky. Had it not been for Russia’s continuous, active support, the illegal separatists — a clear minority in the region they claim to represent — would have long ago run out of steam and weaponry. Eastern Ukraine would have been getting back on its feet, flows of internally displaced persons (IDPs) would have stopped and reversed, and no more lives would have been lost.
This conflict has already claimed too many lives. Even moderate estimates show that over 2,000 have been killed since April. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has noted over 200,000 IDPs and about 3.9 million people affected by conflict as of 15 August. People are dying in Ukraine because of the criminal acts carried out by the illegal separatists and their Russian supporters. Soldiers who are citizens of Russia are also now losing their lives in this criminal war against the State of Ukraine. As reported by various sources, the mothers of Russian soldiers are seeking answers regarding their children, at least four hundred dead. Journalists who are trying to investigate and report on soldiers’ graves in Pskov have been threatened and harassed.
How many more lives need to be lost and people maimed for Russia to realize its folly of aggression against Ukraine? Ukraine does not need any more Russian so-called humanitarian convoys. Ukraine does not need more Russian tanks, troops or rearmament of separatist bands. What Ukraine needs is a most urgent return by Russia to the internationally accepted norms of behaviour, compliance with international law and respect for the Charter of the United Nations — for which Russia, as a permanent member of the Council, bears a special responsibility.
Lithuania calls on Russia, in the strongest of terms, to return to its senses and to comply with the purposes and principles of the Charter, immediately withdraw its military forces, weaponry and equipment from the sovereign territory of Ukraine, secure its borders, cease the shelling of Ukraine from Russian territory, and urgently end all support to the illegal armed separatist groups in the east of Ukraine.
President Poroshenko’s peace plan must be urgently implemented. As for the Geneva statement, whose non-implementation is so often lamented by Russia, that statement, as well as any ceasefire, must be implemented by all sides, including the illegal separatists and including Russia itself. Anything less than that is equivalent to a cynical demand for Ukraine’s unconditional surrender. Like any sovereign Member of the United Nations, Ukraine has the right to defend itself, as per Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. That right cannot be taken by anyone.
For too long now we have watched Russia’s creeping attack against Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. And because it was happening one step at a time, our response has been like that of the proverbial frog in boiling water.
Once international laws been brazenly broken, as they are vis-à-vis Ukraine, it would be naïve to think that such disregard for international norms of behaviour will stop at that and will not creep even further. Are we really ready to take such risks?
Lithuania condemns in the strongest terms the invasion of Ukraine’s territory by the armed forces of the Russian Federation as an open and blatant violation of Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and a serious blow to peace, security and stability across the entire region and well beyond. For months we have watched countless violations of Ukraine’s unity and territorial integrity — first Crimea’s annexation, then the war initiated by Russian-supported fringe separatist groups in eastern Ukraine, then provocative manipulations of humanitarian aid with semi-empty humanitarian trucks, then soldiers lost on the other side of the border and now Russian forces on Ukraine’s sovereign territory.
Within the past day, as reported, troops from the Russian 98th Guards Airborn Division from Ivanovo have taken over the Ukrainian city of Novoazovsk. New, previously safe areas of Ukraine have been affected, expanding the zone of conflict. “There are active soldiers fighting among us who preferred to spend their vacation not on the beach, but with us, among their brothers, who are fighting for their freedom”, says Aleksandr Zakharchenko, a rebel commander and the self-proclaimed prime minister of a non-existent Donetsk People’s Republic, boasting in an interview on Russian State-run television, adding that there were some 3,000 to 4,000 Russians among the separatists ranks.
A member of the Russian President’s advisory council on human rights, Ella Polyakova, said on Thursday that she believed Russia was carrying out an invasion of Ukraine. “When masses of people, under commanders’ orders, on tanks, armoured personnel carriers and using heavy weapons, are on the territory of another country, across the border, I consider this an invasion.”
Such actions by the Russian Federation are in gross violation of the Charter of the United Nations, in particular Article 2, paragraph 4, and other fundamental principles — as we have said in the Council many times before — and norms of international law, including the Helsinki Final Act, the 1997 Treaty between the Russian Federation and Ukraine on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership and the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, whereby Ukraine renounced its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees. Specifically, Budapest Memorandum articles 1 and 2 impose clear-cut obligations on Russia to respect the political independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its existing borders of 1994, and not threaten it or use force by any means.
By now the Council has held close to 30 meetings on Ukraine. We have heard numerous assurances by Russia, here and elsewhere, regarding its desire for a solution to the crisis in Ukraine. All of this time, however, instead of seeking that solution, Russia has been escalating the situation, as the flow of weapons, equipment, mercenaries and now troops has continued across Russia’s borders into the territory of Ukraine. We note the request by the Russian Federation. I am also very well aware of certain labels that my delegations has been given. In spite of that fact, since those labels have been repeated on various occasions — “killer amendments” and things of the kind — we appreciate the drafting of the statement referred to by the representative of the Russian Federation. However, we would like to have a little bit more time to look into the text seriously.
In our opinion, some of aspects are not reflected in that text. For one, we are very well aware of the information that separatists have been preventing the provision of humanitarian assistance to the population. Humanitarian assistance has been offered by the Government of Ukraine. A call to the separatists not to prevent the delivery of humanitarian assistance is something that we should like to see in the text, as well as some other amendments that we might come up with.","I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing. The current situation in eastern Ukraine is tantamount to a dangerous escalation of the conflict between separatists, rebels and Government forces. New fronts have been opened in the conflict, and it is now spreading to a wider geographical area. Needless to say, that further complicates what was already a very difficult and delicate situation with an ever-increasing array of actors. Reports of Russian troops and military equipment moving into Ukrainian territory are a major concern to all of us. We note, however, that the Russian representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Andrey Kelin, has emphatically denied the reports.
We therefore urge both Ukraine and Russia to resolve their differences peacefully and through genuine dialogue and negotiation. Existing, relatively credible frameworks such as the friendship treaty between the two countries and the 17 April Geneva statement are valid points of departure towards reconciliation. Indeed, President Putin and President Poroshenko must maintain their dialogue and build on it like a scaffold: it is the only valid path to a mutually acceptable diplomatic solution to the crisis. A military solution, in our view, is not a viable one. A ceasefire should be urgently negotiated and agreed as the first necessary step in ending the conflict, which has left 2,000 people dead, more than 3,000 wounded and tens of thousands displaced from their homes.
For its part, the Government of Ukraine must continue to accommodate the legitimate aspirations of all components of its citizenry and protect their interests. We are confident that strident efforts towards greater inclusiveness will foster the necessary national cohesion. That has the potential of reducing hostilities and acts of agitation and of establishing the foundations for building a peaceful, prosperous and united nation.
Throughout our engagement on this issue, we have consistently stressed the need to uphold universally agreed principles and the sanctity of international law. That of course begins with respect for the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations, and those are the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all States. Those are the principles that guide Nigeria’s position and have informed our stance. We believe that only a diplomatic solution, which is achievable by direct dialogue between the parties, can resolve the current conflict. We urge those with influence on the warring parties to exert that influence and to bring it to bear on the situation in the interest of wider international peace and security.","We extend our thanks to Mr. Feltman for his briefing on the situation in Ukraine.
Jordan expresses its deep concern about the escalation of the crisis in Ukraine and the developing situation. Jordan reaffirms the need for respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and to refrain from any provocative action that could threaten peace and security. Such conduct will only complicate matters in eastern Ukraine and negatively impact international efforts towards peace. We call upon all parties to refrain from using military means and to cooperate in forging a peaceful solution based on the Charter of the United Nations, the rules of international law and all the efforts made in recent months, including agreements signed between the two parties.
Access for humanitarian assistance is urgently needed to enable the delivery of assistance by the International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian relief organizations. Such assistance must not be politicized. It must remain a humanitarian task to help those in need.
We also reiterate the need to translate the outcome of the Belarus summit into real progress in peace talks and the release of all hostages. In that regard, we call upon both parties, Russian and Ukrainian, to continue talking and consulting. Hopefully, that will lead to peace between the two parties. We also hope that peace can be linked to political and economic interests for the good of the peoples of both parties. Such cooperation would enable the increased risks that threaten the security of Russia and Ukraine and all of the region to be eliminated.
Jordan calls upon the United Nations and all of the parties to take steps in the correct direction to bolster political dialogue between Russian and Ukraine, and to build on the efforts made to protect the security and stability of Ukraine, including establishing mechanisms that would protect civilians and make sure that assistance reaches those who need it. Jordan believes that real peace between the two parties would require political will on the part of all parties, as well as goodwill and a realization that provocation, military or otherwise, will not lead to peace, but only to more escalation and a worsening of the situation.","We would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing and express our appreciation for the efforts that the Secretary-General has continued to undertake to end the current situation in Ukraine.
Chile would like once again to express its deep concern about the serious escalation of the crisis in eastern and southern Ukraine, especially in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, and now in Novoazovsk. It is essential to reverse the escalation immediately to ensure that those regions return to peace and security, because the situation there is already very dangerous and unpredictable. For all those reasons, we call on the parties to exercise maximum restraint and moderation and to cease all fighting immediately.
Our country would like to reiterate once again, as we have done consistently since the start of the crisis in Ukraine, that there is an obligation to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law, as well as to observe the principle of non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of another State. That principle has also been enshrined, inter alia, in the Helsinki Final Act, which created the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), of which Ukraine and Russia are both signatories, as well as the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, both of which documents apply fully to both Russia and Ukraine, among other States.
In that connection, therefore, we would like to also state that the parties involved should refrain from carrying out actions that are incompatible with the Charter of the United Nations and international law. With that in mind, Chile would like to make an appeal for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops present on Ukrainian territory, unless they have been expressly authorized by the legitimate authorities of that country.
We are very concerned by the humanitarian and human rights situation in the southern and eastern parts of Ukraine, especially the growing number of internally displaced persons and the situation of ethnic minorities. We are also concerned about the increasing violations of human rights that have been recorded in those areas, which makes it essential to restore the rule of law in that region. In that connection, we would like to note that humanitarian aid initiatives should be implemented with full respect for the sovereignty of Ukraine and in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.
We hope that the observation mission, in close cooperation with the special monitoring mission of the OSCE, will continue to play a constructive role in mitigating the tensions on the ground.
As we have stated previously, we would like to reiterate that accountability should be ensured regarding all violations and abuses of human rights so as to ensure that those responsible, whoever they are, are brought to justice.
Once again, we would like call upon the parties to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis through direct political dialogue, to refrain from unilateral measures and to support international mediation efforts, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 68/262. In that regard, we welcome the meeting between the Presidents of Ukraine and Russia in Minsk on 26 August, and we encourage them to continue those contacts and to intensify them in order to achieve a peaceful and rapid solution to the crisis in Ukraine.
We would also like to highlight the various initiatives of the Secretary-General and, overall, of the entire United Nations system. They have tried since the very beginning of the crisis to find a peaceful solution to it.
Chile believes that the time has come for constructive participation in an inclusive process that ensures the rule of law, fundamental freedoms and respect for human rights, as well as the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in order to ensure conditions that will enable the Ukrainian people to determine its own future sovereignty in a peaceful and democratic way.","I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his readiness to give a briefing to the Council on the urgent situation in Ukraine.
Chad would like to express its serious concern with regard to the rapid deterioration of the situation in Ukraine, in particular in the Donetsk region. The meeting of the two Heads of State — Mr. Poroshenko and Mr. Putin — on Tuesday, 26 August in Minsk is, in our view, a new step towards de-escalating the tension. However, only two days later, reports indicate an intensification of the fighting in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions and the presence of 1,000 Russian volunteers who are supposedly fighting in the Ukrainian territory alongside pro-Russian separatists. The new escalation is a cause of concern for Chad.
As we have repeated many times, the solution to the crisis in Ukraine must be political and should be reached through an inclusive, direct dialogue on the basis of respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.","I thank Mr. Feltman for his briefing. We recognize the ongoing efforts that the Secretary-General, Mr. Feltman and other colleagues are making to resolve the crisis.
There is now overwhelming evidence that significant numbers of Russian troops, armoured personnel carriers, tanks and other equipment have moved into Ukrainian territory. There are credible reports that Russian combat soldiers equipped with sophisticated heavy weaponry are operating inside Ukraine. Large quantities of advanced weapons, including air-defence systems, artillery tanks and armoured personnel carriers, are being transferred to separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. Russian paratroopers have been captured in Ukraine, and there are reports of funerals being held in Russia for Russian troops killed in Ukraine. Yesterday there were reports of some 100 tanks, armoured vehicles and rocket launchers travelling towards Telmanove, south of Donetsk.
In the past 48 hours, separatists have conducted operations to seize the coastal town of Novoazovsk and several villages inside Ukraine near the Russian border. Reports that regular Russian armed forces are involved are deeply concerning. The latest developments indicate a new and even more dangerous escalation of the crisis, which appears to be moving to a wider area of Ukraine, including the southern land route to Crimea. All of that points to the use of force by Russia against Ukraine. That would be a flagrant breach of Ukraine’s sovereignty and a blatant violation of the Charter of the United Nations.
The latest developments come against a backdrop of other serious incidents, including the killing by separatists of the Lithuanian Honorary Consul in Luhansk, on 22 August; the parading by separatists of captured Ukrainian soldiers in Donetsk on 24 August, in blatant contravention of the prohibition on humiliating and degrading treatment of prisoners of war, the Geneva Conventions and customary international law; and a Russian helicopter attack on a border post in Luhansk oblast on 25 August, in which four border guards were killed. Despite claims by Russia of non-involvement in the conflict, we have the public statement of 28 August by separatist leader Zakharchenko claiming that some 3,000 to 4,000 Russians have fought in separatist ranks since the conflict began.
We are also deeply concerned about Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov’s announcement on 25 August that a second aid convoy would be sent to Ukraine this week, despite the fact that the first proceeded without the agreement of the Ukrainian Government or the participation of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Australian Foreign Minister Bishop described the aid convoy situation, on 24 August, as one in which Russia showed flagrant and reckless disregard for international norms and international law. Any further aid convoys must be sent only with the agreement of the Ukrainian Government.
The 26 August talks in Minsk had the potential to provide a useful forum for finding a diplomatic way to end the crisis, but at the same time that Russia was engaging in those talks further escalation was occurring in southern Ukraine.
Some immediate steps must be taken. Russia must immediately withdraw its military equipment and personnel from Ukrainian territory. Russia should withdraw all support for the separatists and ask them to lay down their arms so that the conflict can be brought to an immediate end. Russia must also control its border. That is the only effective way to prevent troops and equipment from entering Ukraine and is key to establishing a ceasefire, as has been said by other speakers. Strenuous efforts must be made to engage in political dialogue. That depends on Russia.
While the focus of the discussion has been on developments in the past 48 hours, we must not lose sight of the need for the full implementation of resolution 2166 (2014). The Netherlands Mission has just circulated to Council members a letter on its response to the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 crash. Significant progress has been made by the Netherlands in identifying the remains of the victims and repatriating them to their own countries. The letter also states that the independent investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing and that the Netherlands remains fully committed to ensuring accountability for the perpetrators.
Australia is working closely with the Netherlands on the response to the crash and fully supports its efforts. In order for those efforts to succeed, it is imperative that all States fully implement the provisions of resolution 2166 (2014).",,,,"I thank you, Mr. President, for convening this emergency meeting of the Security Council to address recent developments in eastern Ukraine. I thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, for his comprehensive briefing. We recognize the Secretary-General’s good offices and the efforts by Mr. Feltman to find a solution to the crisis.
Rwanda, like all other members of the Security Council, is extremely alarmed at the rapidly deteriorating situation in eastern Ukraine. The regional summit held on 26 August in Minsk — where Presidents Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine and Vladimir Putin of the Russian Federation met for the first time since the election of the former in May — had raised hope for a ceasefire and a diplomatic solution to the conflict. Unfortunately, the past few days were marked by renewed fighting in eastern Ukraine, particularly in the Donetsk region, where the town of Novoazovsk has fallen into the hands of armed separatists who now threaten to take over the strategic port city of Mariupol. In that regard, we were troubled by the information provided by one of the leaders of the armed separatists that 3,000 to 4,000 Russian nationalists had joined their ranks. We are also concerned at the accusations of border crossings by Russian elements into Ukraine. It is clear that the rise of tension and rhetoric between Ukraine and the Russian Federation could, if not properly addressed, lead to a full-blown conflict between the two countries, thus further threatening international peace and security and worsening a very dire human rights and humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine and the wider region.
The situation in Ukraine has been on the agenda of the Security Council since the end of February. We have been constantly meeting on this crisis. We have held 24 meetings, as Ambassador Power of the United States informed us. But, unfortunately, we have been unable to take any meaningful decision, with the exception of our adoption of resolution 2166 (2014), on 21 July, on the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17.
In any case, given the division in the Council, it is unlikely that a solution will come from New York. Only a genuine dialogue among Ukrainians, coupled with diplomatic talks between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, with the support of the United Nations and regional organizations, can provide a sustainable solution to the crisis. We believe that President Poroshenko’s peace plan and the Minsk process can be a viable framework for achieving that goal.
I will conclude by once again calling on all parties in Ukraine to respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Armed groups must cease hostilities, lay down their weapons in order to de-escalate the situation and give peace a chance. In that regard, we urge all the original stakeholders to use their influence and to work towards peace and stability in the region.","I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing on the situation in Ukraine. Argentina reiterates its concern at the continued deterioration in the security situation in the east and south of Ukraine and at the escalating violence.
It is especially imperative that all parties strictly conform, in their actions, to international law and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. In that regard, we recall the obligation of all States to settle their international disputes by peaceful means, so as not to threaten international peace and security, while acting in full accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, upholding the principles set out in Chapter I, Article 2, and recognizing the significant role of the relevant regional organizations.
The only possible solution is one that is reached through dialogue and negotiation — we have said that before and we reaffirm it. Any confrontational rhetoric or any interference in matters that fall within the domestic jurisdiction of States, whether they be military, political or economic, must be avoided. In that regard, we welcome the meeting held on 26 August in Minsk between the Presidents of Russia and Ukraine. We hope that it will lead to new meetings in order to resolve the differences politically. Similarly, we echo the Secretary-General’s call for continuing discussions with a view to forging an solution to the conflict. We acknowledge the intense efforts and good offices of the Secretary-General. It is necessary for the parties to unconditionally observe human rights and international humanitarian law and ensure proper accountability with regard to the violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law that have been committed.
Finally, as we have done in the past, Argentina emphasizes the Security Council’s primary responsibility for ensuring the maintenance of peace and security, in accordance with the role assigned to it by the Charter. We regret that so far, despite the many times we have met to discuss the situation in Ukraine, the Council has not been able to overcome its division and play a positive role to help the parties find common points on which they can base a political and diplomatic solution. It is therefore crucial that we redouble our efforts to create conditions so that dialogue, which is so urgent, can begin in such a way that solutions can be found to the disagreements. In particular, the actors with the greatest influence should use constructive diplomacy. We reaffirm that the international community must focus its efforts on bringing the parties into a constructive dialogue and find a peaceful way out of the situation, with full respect for human rights, international humanitarian law and the rights of all minorities and while framing its actions strictly within international law and the Charter of the United Nations.","I too would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing. 
We are very concerned by the serious deterioration in the situation in the areas controlled by the separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions resulting from increased fighting in those regiоns. We are also very concerned by reports of renewed fighting in the south-east of Ukraine near the city of Mariupol, during which the separatists took control of the city of Novoazovsk.
For several days, there have been increasing numbers of reports of incursions by Russian regular troops and military vehicles into Ukrainian territory. We are also concerned by reports of bombings of Ukrainian territory from Russia and violations of Ukrainian air space. All unilateral military action by the Russian Federation in Ukraine, whatever the pretext, including humanitarian, would constitute a serious violation of international law and would be viewed as such by the international community. We cannot allow the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine to be violated.
The presence of Russian fighters among the separatists, including among their leaders, is quite unacceptable and must be condemned in the strongest terms. That presence has been reported primarily in various reports of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the situation in Ukraine. It has also been recently recognized by a separatist leader in Donetsk, who explained in a Russian television interview that the latest success of the separatists would not have been possible without the help of Russian servicemen.
Today we are witnessing a new, dangerous stage in the escalation of violence in Ukraine despite official Russian proclamations calling for dialogue and de-escalation. We urge the Russian Federation to immediately cease all forms of hostile activity along the border, in particular the inflow of weapons, military advisers and military staff into the conflict zone, and to withdraw its forces from the border.
Given the ongoing deterioration on the ground, we need to find a lasting political solution to the crisis. That is becoming ever more urgent. In that regard, we welcome the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General to promote dialogue between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, in particular through the missions of Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman to the region.
The dialogue between Ukraine and Russia, initiated in Geneva and Berlin, must be pursued in order to restore the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We welcome the meeting held the day before yesterday in Minsk between the Presidents of the Russian Federation and Ukraine, in particular in the presence of the European Union. We hope that those talks will lead to concrete results, and especially to the establishment of a road map based on President Poroshenko’s peace plan. We hope that consultations between Russia and Ukraine to ensure better control of the borders will be held soon and that the parties’ discussions will lead to the release of prisoners held by illegal armed groups.
The trilateral talks initiated by the Chairperson in Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) are key in that regard, as is the deployment of OSCE observers to the two border posts, Gukovo and Donetsk, along the Russian-Ukrainian border. We hope that the mandate of the mission will be expanded so that it can contribute to the effective, comprehensive and bilateral control of the Russian-Ukrainian border. Securing the border is key for the restoration of peace, as it will put an end to the flow of arms and weaponry to the separatists.
The solution to the Ukrainian crisis can only be political. The Russian Federation must be an integral part of the effort to find a political solution, rather than continue to fuel the crisis, which dates back to another era.","I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing. We take this opportunity to reiterate our full support for the Secretary-General’s good offices, including Mr. Feltman’s recent visit to Ukraine.
The Republic of Korea is closely monitoring the events in eastern Ukraine, and we are deeply concerned about the continuing escalation of tensions. We had hoped that the Minsk meeting between the two Presidents would be a turning point in finding a diplomatic solution to the crisis. But, on the contrary, the situation on the ground has further deteriorated. In particular, we are alarmed that the separatist armed groups have pushed their way into the southern city of Novoazovsk, opening a dangerous new front in the ongoing crisis.
We are also seriously concerned about the report that indicates the involvement of Russian troops in the latest round of fighting inside Ukraine. We hope that it is not true. We hope that Russia’s explanation is true, that there are no Russian troops inside Ukraine. Otherwise, that would constitute a gross violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and would bring the crisis into a new dimension. We strongly oppose any outside military intervention in the situation in Ukraine.
In the light of the volatile situation, we stress that a genuine solution to the crisis can be found only with an immediate cessation of hostilities through dialogue between all the parties concerned. In that regard, we hope that President Poroshenko’s plan for a road map towards a ceasefire with the armed groups can offer a sound basis for the de-escalation of tensions.
The stability and prosperity of Ukraine are critical not only to peace in Europe but also far beyond it. We once again reaffirm our full support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. "
S/PV.7239,41859,"Discussion of the conflict in Donbas, the human rights situation there, and proposed political solutions","I wish to thank Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for his briefing. Armed conflicts have continued to escalate in eastern Ukraine, resulting in severe casualties and property damage. China is deeply concerned about the situation. In armed conflicts, civilians are the most fragile and vulnerable group. Three days ago, Mr. Ging of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs briefed Council members here in this Chamber on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. The international community should call on all parties to take, as soon as possible, actions aimed at easing the situation in Ukraine, building mutual trust and finding a political solution to the crisis. The priority now is to implement an immediate ceasefire through political consultations, carry out a comprehensive dialogue and, on the basis of initiatives such as the Geneva agreement, fully leverage the role of existing dialogue and the liaison mechanism in search of a comprehensive political solution. The Ukrainian crisis can be addressed only through political means. In that process, the legitimate demands of all sides and ethnic groups have to be fully accommodated in order to achieve a balance of interests for all. The international community should also play a constructive role in seeking a political solution to the crisis by vigorously engaging in mediation, pushing for talks, encouraging the parties concerned to maintain dialogue and increased engagement, and creating favourable external conditions for effective interaction among all parties. China supports all efforts aimed at easing the situation, ending the crisis and promoting a political solution. We stand ready to work with other members of the international community to continue to play an active and constructive role in that regard. ","I thank Mr. Šimonović for his presentation of the fourth report of the human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, which remains an essential source of information for us. I would like to take this opportunity to express our full support for the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and all the staff of the mission, who are working under very difficult conditions. The security, humanitarian and human rights situations in Donetsk and Luhansk continue to deteriorate due to the armed separatist groups operating there. In the east of the country, arbitrary arrests, forced disappearances, summary executions, hate speech — in a word, terror — are affecting all civilians. Those who return after having been abducted report having been tortured by armed groups. The separatists are deliberately targeting public infrastructure to restrict civilian access to water, electricity and medical care, and thereby increase their humanitarian needs. Fighting and acts of intimidation are causing civilian casualties and displacement. The report presented to us illustrates that situation. In Crimea, discrimination is now common and Tatars are victims of harassment and intimidation, while the commission of inquiry, despite our repeated requests, still has no access to the Crimea. Displacement and destabilization in the east, where the main industrial centres are located, have economic consequences for the entire country. The violence is fuelled and maintained from outside. As Mr. Šimonović has just reminded us, the armed groups are increasingly more professional and well armed. Their leadership is made up primarily of people from the Russian Federation, who apparently fought in Chechnya and Transnistria. We denounce the presence of those foreign elements and call for an immediate end to outside support. We join the appeal launched by the Ukrainian Government for the flow of arms and fighters from Russia to cease. We reiterate our call for the fighting in eastern Ukraine to stop and for armed groups there to lay down their weapons and evacuate all public buildings occupied illegally. The separatists must engage in a process of political dialogue that allows them to express their position legally and peacefully. The trilateral contact group under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is playing a key role in that regard so that the Ukrainian authorities and those groups can constructively achieve a ceasefire. Faced with this situation, the Ukrainian Government has a responsibility to take appropriate and proportionate measures, in accordance with international standards, to fight armed groups, protect people and control of its borders. It has already taken steps to provide assistance to people forcibly expelled from their homes. Wherever Kyiv has restored its authority, basic services to the population are operating again and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has noted the return of displaced persons. We encourage the full cooperation of the Ukrainian Government with the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies to continue to meet the humanitarian needs. We also welcome the solidarity of Ukrainian citizens in helping those who have been displaced. Everything must be done to encourage a return to calm, which is a necessary precondition for launching a political dialogue. That involves, first and foremost, I repeat, control of the Russian/Ukrainian border so that the flow of weapons and men is stopped. The international community stands ready to support Ukraine in its current efforts to regain its unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity. We welcome the organization by the European Union, at the beginning of July, of a meeting of the contact group aimed at coordinating economic assistance to Ukraine. New measures against Russia have been necessary — adopted by the European Union, the United States, Canada, Japan and Switzerland. They demonstrate the international community’s determination to push Russia to work towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate how much we regret the fact that the investigators of the crash of Flight MH-17 have still not been able to complete their task in spite of the efforts of Australia, the Netherlands and Malaysia, in full cooperation with the Ukrainian authorities. As Ms. Pillay said, we could be talking about a war crime here, and every effort should be made to ensure that those responsible answer for their actions. Generally speaking, every element that the commission of inquiry collects should be able to be used in judicial proceedings. ","I should like to start with two introductory comments. First and foremost, it would be remiss of me not to note that we deem completely wrong the engineering decision that was taken during the reconstruction of the Security Council Chamber. Mr. Šimonović should not cover up the historical picture by which the world recognizes the Security Council. That error must be corrected. Secondly, we understand that everyone has the right to a vacation, including Mr. Šimonović. However, it is clear that he is a little divorced from reality here. It is not clear what proposal by President Poroshenko Mr. Šimonović is praising concerning the start of talks on a ceasefire. We know nothing about any such proposal. Moreover, yesterday the Ukrainian authorities stated that they were interrupting the ceasefire regime established pursuant to resolution 2166 (2014) so as to create the conditions necessary for an objective international inquiry into the deaths of the passengers on the Malaysia Airlines airliner, as a result of which this investigation is confronted by serious problems. I shall now return to the issue under discussion at this meeting. The Security Council did not request the report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and therefore should not be discussing it, especially since the report is interesting merely as an example of elegant political rhetoric, where facts and conclusions are painstakingly shaped to fit a particular political requirement. In reading the report, what jumps out is the absence of what would seem to be the first thing one would expect of United Nations human rights defenders, namely, a call on the sides to cease all military activity, as if the right to life were not the principal right of any human being. The report gave no space to a condemnation of the instances of use by the Ukrainian security forces, in populated areas, of artillery, multiple-launch rocket systems and phosphorus shells, which are prohibited by international conventions. Is there even any passing reference to the promise made by Ukraine not to bomb the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and to ensure their security? Nothing is being said regarding the flowery promise made by President Poroshenko to the inhabitants of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions on this very topic; there is no reference to this treacherous breach of promises. The escalation of the so-called anti-terrorist operation, with its many casualties among the civilian population, continues. Ukrainian security forces are shelling residential neighbourhoods and infrastructure. There is no end in sight to the shelling of Gorlovka. Yesterday, five individuals died there and 10 were injured; a church burned down; a power station was destroyed; and the water supply has been interrupted. Thursday morning, the centre of Donetsk was again shelled. Shells hit a hospital admission ward as well as residential high-rises and a bus depot. Overall, 156 power substations, 18 boilers and seven gas lines were destroyed. These are but a few examples. The report pushes the idea that the self-defence formations are to blame for everything. They are accused of everything short of cannibalism. For example, in paragraph 5 it is stated that those formations were deliberately targeting critically important infrastructure. In other words, they are not only firing upon themselves, they are doing it intentionally. What has led to this brilliant conclusion? And why is there no similar conclusion regarding the actions of the Ukrainian authorities, which are methodically bombing residential neighbourhods? Sometimes from one day to the next they are fighting on the same, almost destroyed high-rise building. A separate topic is the situation of children. According to the information we have received, there are 1,223 child orphans in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The authors of the report termed the efforts of the self-defence formations to take those orphans to safety to the Russian Federation as attempted kidnapping. The report also contains a reference to seriously ill children to whom Russia could provide expert assistance. It states with satisfaction that as a result of the intervention of the Ukrainian authorities, the children remained in Donetsk. It seems that United Nations philanthropists believe that children thrive under fire. Russia’s requests to human rights bodies regarding the evacuation of children have not received any response from Kyiv. What do United Nations human rights defenders think about this? Do children not deserve safety? More than 820,000 Ukrainians are currently finding shelter in Russia. Requests for regulating their status total 188,000. In our territory we have set up 643 temporary shelters for those who have nowhere else to go. Currently there are 47,500 individuals there, of which more than 16,000 are children. The report gives plenty of useful advice to the Ukrainian authorities. It suggests incorporating those who are eradicating the civilian population of south- eastern Ukraine, the so-called volunteer battalions, into the armed forces of Ukraine. The criminals who are currently killing women and children and committing other serious human rights violations must be arrested and brought to justice. But instead of this, it is proposed that they should be legitimized. Perhaps one should also legitimize the foreign mercenaries that are taking part in the so-called anti-terrorist operation, something the Ukrainian authorities no longer conceal. It would be remiss of me not to mention the extremely biased picture painted by the report regarding the situation of journalists. Allegedly only one representative of the Russian media was detained and then released by the Ukrainian army, and not a word is said about the detention and beating up of journalists from the television channels Zvezda and LifeNews. The reported version, that the two Russian journalists who died could have been killed by the self- defence formations, is false. Regarding the human rights situation in Ukraine, one cannot focus solely on the territory under the control of the self-defence formations, which, judging by the report, suffers from a complete absence of the rule of law. Is there any rule of law in the rest of Ukraine? There is a passing reference in the report to a number of steps that are aimed at banning the Communist Party of Ukraine. These legitimately elected parliamentarians are currently being brutally persecuted, including by law-enforcement agencies, for their political convictions. This is but another step in the systematic punishment of those who have come to power as a result of the armed revolt of their political opponents, who, by the way, just happen to represent the south-eastern part of the country. A clear example of the disregard for the principle of the rule of law is the lack of progress in investigating the serious crimes committed in the Maidan and in Odessa and Mariupol. In the current atmosphere of fear, is it any wonder that Odessans and the citizens of other areas do not trust the investigators sent by Kyiv and refuse to cooperate with them, even as documents relating to these crimes are disappearing without a trace? This is mentioned in the report. It is clear, and it is confirmed in the report, that the armed forces, including the Ukrainian security services, now have unprecedented power and are clearly violating fundamental human rights. They are seizing people without due process, using violence against detainees, and using the tactics of intimidation and threats to extract testimony from witnesses. Bearing in mind the fact that the justice system is paralysed, what sort of impartial investigations and prosecution can we expect in Ukraine? The Government of Ukraine is ignoring the commitments it has undertaken, including under the Geneva statement of 17 April. The process of constitutional reform in Ukraine, which envisions decentralizing power, expanding the authority of the regions and giving the Russian language special status, is being put off indefinitely. In fact, there is now talk of strengthening presidential power, which is exactly the opposite of what was demanded by the Maidan protesters demanded, whom the authorities are trying to get rid of. That begs the question, what did the people fight for? We wish once again to underscore the harmfulness of attempts to resolve the crisis in Ukraine through violence. We call for an immediate end to military actions in the country and a solution to the humanitarian problems. A very important step should be the speedy beginning of constitutional reforms, which should involve all the regions of Ukraine and would be open to public consideration. As for the unfounded conjectures in the report regarding the situation in Crimea, which is part of the Russian Federation, this cannot be a subject for discussion at today’s meeting, which is dedicated to the situation in Ukraine. Having adopted the historic decision on reunification with Russia, the inhabitants of Crimea have delivered themselves from the horrors that are unfolding for everyone to see in the south- eastern part of Ukraine. ","I shall now make a statement in my capacity as representative of the United Kingdom. I would like to thank Mr. Šimonović for his briefing and for his latest report on Ukraine. I can understand why Ambassador Churkin does not want the Security Council to discuss this United Nations report, because it provides further damning evidence of the appalling abuses perpetrated against the civilian population by pro-Russian armed groups in eastern Ukraine. It also acknowledges Ukraine’s legitimate right and its sovereign duty to restore law and order and to protect its citizens. We share the United Nations view that force must be used proportionately and in full compliance with domestic and international law. We welcome Ukraine’s clear, unambiguous commitment to these important principles. There is one overwhelming conclusion to be drawn from this report: that these armed groups cannot possibly claim to be acting in defence of the civilian population, the very same population against which they are committing the most appalling human rights abuses. They are abducting women and children in order to extort money from their families. They are using civilians as forced labour and as human shields. They offered the local population the choice between fighting on the front lines and facing detention, torture and mistreatment. They abduct people simply because they are HIV-positive and tell them that they must “wash off the guilt with blood”. All of these abuses and many more are detailed in the United Nations report. These are not the actions of those interested in protecting the civilian population. They are the actions of violent and abusive armed thugs. As the United Nations report puts it, these groups exercise their power over the civilian population in raw and brutal ways which are “putting the whole civilian population at risk”. In addition to those human rights abuses, the report highlights the fact that separatists have deliberately targeted critical public utilities, including water, electricity and sewerage. In so doing, they are denying the people under their control access to basic services. We welcome the urgent action that the Ukrainian Government is taking to restore these services in the liberated areas. So if these armed groups are not defending the interests of the people they claim to represent, the question must be asked: whose interests are they defending? We must also ask why the Russian Federation continues to support them. By supplying those groups with weaponry, training and personnel, Russia is fuelling the suffering of an innocent population, the same people whose welfare they claim to care so much about. Throughout this crisis, Russia has acted in violation of international law, in violation of human rights and in violation of its own stated objectives. There have been many moments when Russia has had the opportunity to change course, when 100 countries rejected the illegal annexation of Crimea, when Ukraine elected a new President whose legitimacy could not be questioned, when 298 innocent lives were lost in the shooting down of MH-17. Yet despite those watershed events, Russia continues recklessly to fuel the conflict. As we speak, Russia is building up its forces on the Ukrainian border. An additional 8,000 troops have arrived since 11 July. Many more are stationed in the illegally annexed region of Crimea. Now we hear that Russia is ready to intervene on humanitarian grounds to alleviate the suffering that it has manufactured. This is completely unwarranted. Russia is the problem, not the solution. As we were briefed by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs earlier this week, the United Nations is already fully engaged. United Nations agencies, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and UNICEF, are present on the ground and are working with the International Committee of the Red Cross, international non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations and local communities to support the Ukrainian-led humanitarian response. But rather than supporting this effort, Russia threatens unilateral action. If Moscow wants to contribute, there are two things it can do immediately: first, it can help to fund the United Nations activities and, secondly, it can cease its support for illegal armed groups. That is the only way the people of eastern Ukraine will be able to return to their daily lives free from the fear of intimidation and violence that the report describes. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine. ","I thank Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović and his team for the thorough research contained in the report of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine. This is an extremely challenging time for the people of Ukraine. No-one should be driven from their home, and we are committed to doing everything possible to assist the displaced, regardless of where they have fled. No-one should be forced to live without access to essential medicine or with only an hour of access to water a day. As we have consistently made clear throughout this conflict, and as we reiterate today, all sides must take every precaution to prevent the loss of civilian life. The humanitarian situation needs addressing, but not by those who have caused it. That is why we welcome the fact that the Ukrainian Government has created humanitarian corridors, which are allowing critical aid to get into — and civilians to get out of — separatist- controlled areas. Ukraine is making a concerted effort to address the complex needs of approximately 117,000 people who have been internally displaced. In doing so, Ukraine is working effectively with international humanitarian organizations to provide assistance. This week, Russia proposed creating humanitarian corridors to assist the affected populations in Ukraine. But in Ukraine, urgent humanitarian assistance should be delivered by the international humanitarian organizations that have the expertise, experience and independence to provide it. It should not be delivered by Russia. Given that Ukraine has allowed international humanitarian groups to deliver aid within its territory, there is no logical reason that Russia should seek to deliver it. Therefore, any further unilateral intervention by Russia into Ukrainian territory, including one under the guise of providing humanitarian aid, would be completely unacceptable and deeply alarming, and it would be viewed as an invasion of Ukraine. We welcome today’s statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross that it is exploring the possibility of providing more support in conflict areas, which is something they can do once they have worked out the modalities with the Ukrainian authorities and, critically, once they have the security guarantees they need from the armed separatists, something Russia has not yet helped to secure. If Russia wishes to channel aid to those populations, I am certain that my colleagues on the Council can take swift steps to ensure that an impartial international aid organization like the International Committee of the Red Cross can deliver the aid on Russia’s behalf. Last week the Russians again floated the idea of sending Russian “peacekeepers” to eastern Ukraine. A Russian peacekeeper in Ukraine is an oxymoron. At every step in the current crisis, Russians have sabotaged peace, not built it. It is particularly worrisome given Russia’s purported annexation of Crimea, which was predicated on calls by an illegitimate puppet Government for Russia to send troops to restore peace. Peacekeepers are impartial, yet Russia fully supports Russian armed separatists in the conflict. We have seen the peace that Russian occupation has brought to Crimea since that time. As the most recent United Nations report makes clear, the freedoms of speech and assembly have been violently repressed, ethnic minorities systematically persecuted and civilians abducted with impunity, 350 of whom are still unaccounted for. The United Nations also said that no progress has been made on any of the 17 previous recommendations it has made to Russia on serious human rights problems in Crimea. Russia has repeatedly accused members of the Council of politicizing a humanitarian situation, but Russia has it backwards. In fact, it is Russia that is trying to disguise a political crisis — one manufactured and exported by Moscow — as a humanitarian one. The very humanitarian problems that Russia is decrying in eastern Ukraine and turning a blind eye to in Crimea are directly traceable to violence it has facilitated or supported. Why have thousands of people been displaced? Look no further than the “egregious human rights abuses” in separatist-controlled areas documented in the United Nations report. Why do civilians lack access to basic services? The United Nations report documents the “deliberate targeting by the armed groups of critical public utilities like water, electricity and sewage plants”. In recent weeks, Russian cross-border military assistance to illegal separatists has actually increased substantially. Russian tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, multiple rocket launcher systems and truckloads of munitions continue to flow to separatists while new fighters are trained on Russian soil. Russia continues to take actions that escalate the conflict, amassing more and more troops and hardware near the border, launching extensive military exercises this week and shelling across the border into sovereign Ukrainian territory. Perhaps most shocking is that Russia has doubled- down on its support for rebels and provocative actions after witnessing the horrific carnage that resulted from the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. On Wednesday, international investigators were once again forced to suspend their work at the MH-17 crash site due to risks of being taken hostage by illegal armed groups and the threat felt by the increased concentration of Russian troops nearby. That is deplorable. It is yet another insult to the dignity of the victims and their loved ones, who have already endured more than any families should ever have to endure. It flies in the face of the resolution adopted by the Security Council and the unified commitment to justice that the resolution embodies (resolution 2166 (2014)). It obstructs efforts to punish those responsible for that abhorrent crime. In conclusion, let me read from a statement given by a senior Russian official: “The population is panicking and there are a growing number of refugees who are attempting to flee in order to save their lives. A humanitarian catastrophe is in the making. Over the past week, the Russian Federation has continued to receive refugees. However, tens of thousands of innocent civilians remain in the conflict zone. Those circumstances dictate the logic of the steps to be taken by us now.” Those remarks were delivered by a senior Russian official in the Security Council about a region where Russian-backed separatists were sowing violence. Only the remarks were delivered on 8 August 2008, six years ago to the day, and the country that the Russian senior official was speaking about was not Ukraine but Georgia. Playing the role of Luhansk and Donetsk was the province of South Ossetia. We all know what followed. South Ossetia, Crimea, now eastern Ukraine — similar words have presaged military action. The onus is on the Council and the entire international community to meet legitimate humanitarian needs and do so urgently, but in so doing to make sure that history does not repeat itself. ",,,,,,,,,,,"Let me also thank Mr. Šimonović for his briefing today. Ukraine values his important contribution and that of his team.
The mission’s latest report reveals the true nature of the criminal organizations that are committing terrible abuses against our citizens. Entire towns and villages are being used as human shields. Gunmen are kidnapping civilians for the purpose of ransom, exchange or use as labour force; others, they are torturing and murdering.
How do those crimes help the people they claim to represent? Their tactics are nothing more than terrorism, threatening the lives, health, well-being of our compatriots. It is the obligation of the Government to protect its own citizens. That is the paramount objective of Ukraine’s operation against the terrorists — terrorists who have refused to enter into a political dialogue, terrorists who are led by foreigners who are working for the secret service of the Russian Federation.
The monitoring mission’s report also clearly demonstrates that the Russian occupation of Crimea has led to harassment and discrimination against ethnic Ukrainians, Crimean Tatars, members of religious minorities and activists who are opposed to the so-called Crimean referendum of 16 March. Even now, people continue to disappear. Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar newspapers are under threat of being shut down. We are deeply concerned with the violations. We underline that as the occupying Power, it is Russia’s responsibility to ensure the observance of human rights and freedoms of the population of Crimea. On our part, the Government of Ukraine will take all feasible efforts to protect our compatriots’ rights and freedoms in the occupied territories.
Ukraine will not tolerate politically motivated cases against Nadia Savchenko and five other members of the military, which are vivid examples of Russia’s negligence of human rights standards. Allegations brought against our citizens have no legal grounds and are used as instruments of political manipulation and pressure. There is no humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. However the growing number of internally displaced persons from Crimea and the Luhansk and Donetsk regions is disturbing. At the same time, the credibility of the information on the huge number of refugees from Ukraine to Russia presented by the Russian authorities is very doubtful and needs to be assessed by international experts.
The Government of Ukraine accepts the recommendations contained in the monitoring mission’s report. Ukraine is ready to further develop and deepen cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in order to ensure the protection of human rights, taking into account all the needs of the population of every region of our country.
We fully acknowledge that there is still a lot to be done to strengthen the rule of law and democracy in our country. Yesterday in his speech at the Constituent Assembly of the National Council of Reforms, President Petro Poroshencko said that a war could not be an excuse for the lack of reform. We see the recently signed Association Agreement with the European Union as integral document that provides the framework for reform in Ukraine.
The successful investigation of high-profile cases, such as human rights violations during the protests in Independence Square and the tragedy in Odessa. is a matter of honour to the leadership of honour to the leadership of Ukraine and remains a top priority. Ukraine’s law enforcement agency will cooperate fully with the United Nations mission in monitoring the process of that investigation.
The downing of Flight MH-17 is a tragedy that may constitute a grave violation of international law that may amount to war crimes. The Government of Ukraine is making every effort to ensure a fair international investigation of the incident, in accordance with resolution 2166 (2014). We reiterate our call to Russia to use its influence on the illegal armed groups in order to make them grant it full and unimpeded access to the crash site for the international investigation team.
We have conclusive evidence that Flight MH-17 was downed by Russian-backed terrorists with a Buk missile system, which was fired by a crew and which had been delivered from Russia. That was confirmed by our intelligence — intercepted telephone conversations of the terrorists and satellite images.
In conclusion, I would like to just say that the situation on the Ukrainian/Russian border remains extremely tense. Russia continues to build up its military along the border with Ukraine and to shell settlements and positions of the counter-terrorism forces of Ukraine located near the border.
Russian military aircraft and drones violate Ukraine’s air space daily. There are serious grounds to expect a large-scale and open invasion of Russian troops into Ukraine, under the guise of peacekeeping operations. In that context, we want to state that no Russian forces can enter the territory of Ukraine without the consent of Ukrainian authorities. Any Russian troops entering the territory of Ukraine will be regarded as aggressors and treated accordingly. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I would like to thank Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for his extensive briefing. The presence of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in eastern Ukraine and their reporting from there remain essential. Such missions register and report facts on the ground, identify the existing gaps in Government policies and, in the case of the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, offer important recommendations to the Ukrainian Government. Such recommendations need to be followed up as the country’s leadership undertakes the comprehensive constitutional and administrative reforms necessary for the country to recover after years of corruption and neglect, as well as the impact of the current crisis.
Those missions register the countless and ongoing human rights violations by the Russia-supported armed separatists, who, under the false pretexts of self-determination and violations of minority rights, have dealt a blow to the rule of law and human rights in the region as they persist in their efforts to erode Ukraine’s sovereignty and to destroy its territorial integrity.
As the Assistant Secretary-General has just mentioned, a reign of fear and terror in the rebel-held areas prevails. The most recent report also points out that law and order in the rebel-held areas has collapsed. The rule of law has in fact been substituted by the rule of the gun. The details provided by the report reveal the true nature of the militant separatists and their imported leaders, whom their main sponsor, Russia, has sought time and again in the Chamber to portray as mere peaceful protesters. The trademark activities of those so-called peaceful protesters, as the report points out, include intimidation, abductions, illegal detention, torture and ill-treatment, as well as the deliberate targeting of critical public utilities, the illegal occupation and seizing of public and private property, bank robberies and attacks on coal mines. To date, 104 buildings remain under the control of those illegal armed groups. Such illegally occupied public buildings are often used to detain and torture civil activists, journalists and political opponents.
Armed separatists have seized warehouses and factories, using the premises as training camps or military repair shops. Such actions, as well as their threats and intimidation, have led to the shutdown of many factories, causing unemployment in the region to soar. As the Assistant Secretary-General has just said, the separatists have abducted some 925 people, the whereabouts of 465 of whom remain unknown. Just this week, three Red Cross employees were reportedly kidnapped and are being held in detention by the armed militants. None of those actions, all of which are clear and criminal violations of human rights law, have ever been condemned by Russia, which has instead repeatedly sought the Council’s condemnation of Ukraine for its legitimate efforts to restore law and order in the east of the country.
In the past two weeks, there have been new reports — the Assistant Secretary-General has spoken extensively in that regard — about the situation of journalists and the media. More journalists have gone missing or were harassed in eastern Ukraine. Journalists attempting to report on the crash of Flight MH-17, including representatives of Dagens Nyheter, the BBC, the Daily Beast, Nieuwsuur, Time and Russia Today, were detained and harassed by armed gangs.
As of 15 July, 13,381 people have moved from Crimea and a new wave of internally displaced persons (IDPs) is expected during the year, in addition to the already large numbers of IDPs. The harassment and discrimination against ethnic Ukrainians, Crimean Tatars and representatives of religious and other minorities continue. Restrictions on movement and the right to peaceful assembly continue. The Crimean Tatar leaders Mustafa Dzhemilev and Refat Chubarov have been barred from entering their homeland by the Russian occupying authorities.
The written records of execution orders, authorized and signed personally by the so-called commander-in-chief of the illegal Donetsk People’s Republic, Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, and of the hearings of self-proclaimed military tribunals convicting people to death have been found in Slovyansk. An illegal militant group, representing no one but itself and headed by foreign passport holders, whose sole authority on the ground stems from the guns that they carry, grants itself the authority to assign and execute extrajudiciary death sentences on an illegally occupied territory. The mass graves discovered recently in areas liberated by the Ukrainian forces are a tragic testimony to the degree of lawlessness that marks the insurgent actions.
As the Assistant Secretary-General has just testified, the armed insurgents are increasingly better armed and use heavy weaponry, including mortars, anti-aircraft guns, tanks and armoured vehicles. They continue to shoot down helicopters and planes, even at high altitudes, including the downing this week of a Ukrainian military plane and transport helicopter.
Sources on the ground indicate the tendency of the past days that whenever Ukrainian troops deploy sufficient power to pose a threat to the militants and are in a position to launch strikes against their positions, the illegal armed groups redeploy to a nearby town, exposing civilian populations to the threat of combat and forcing them to flee, as they install their armed vehicles, artillery and Grad rocket launchers in residential areas.
The Government’s efforts to establish a ceasefire or humanitarian corridors have been repeatedly violated by the insurgents. While Russia is quick to blame the Ukrainian authorities, we are yet to hear a single condemnation by Russia of the reckless acts by the insurgents, including around the crash site of the Malaysian civilian airliner. We fully agree with the Assistant Secretary-General about the importance of a thorough and independent investigation into the crash and the need to bring those responsible to account.
The reports of the OSCE monitoring mission have affirmed the facts with regard to the movement of armed individuals across the Russian border into Ukraine and back. Instead of closing its borders to such illegal movements of mercenaries and weapons, Russia continues to carry out war games at Ukraine’s eastern border. Alarmingly large numbers of combat-ready troops and armaments are once again amassed on Ukraine’s borders. Defence Minister Shoigu’s latest statements on the combat readiness of so-called Russian peacekeepers are also highly alarming and once again raise serious questions about Russia’s true intentions in the region.
No less troubling is Russia’s ongoing escalation of Cold War rhetoric against Europe and the West, now extended into sanctioning food imports, which will undoubtedly affect the Russian population itself. All those actions are the exact opposite to the confidence-building and de-escalation that are so badly needed, for which the international community has called repeatedly. While we are seriously concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the east of Ukraine and the civilian suffering — again, the Assistant Secretary-General has spoken extensively about that — we must be very clear. The key to ending the suffering is in the hands of Russia and hinges on its continued support to illegal separatist groups.","I also thank Assistant Secretary-General Ivan Šimonović for his briefing. The parties to the conflict must exercise restraint. They must respect the Charter of the United Nations, work on the basis of consensus, show commitment to compromising and seek a comprehensive settlement through peaceful means. We reiterate our call on Member States with influence to work assiduously and to use the existing bilateral and multilateral instruments in resolving the crisis.
For its part, the international community should do more to promote peace and dialogue. In that connection, we acknowledge the purposeful and spirited engagement of the United Nations in the efforts to re-establish order and stability in Ukraine. It should continue to play a pivotal role in resolving the crisis. Nigeria supports all efforts that would result in the easing of tensions and propel the parties towards a peaceful settlement.
On the economic impact of the crisis, we note the crippling effects of the recession in Donetsk and Luhansk, which, if not properly addressed, could have a severe impact on the rest of the country. The region, which is the hub of industrial enterprise and mining, has been harshly affected. Factories and businesses have shut down. Public utilities have been damaged, gas reserves have been exhausted and there is a shortage of water and medical supplies. The task of rebuilding will indeed be very daunting, particularly in the light of the economic recession currently gripping the country.
The challenges facing the Government of Ukraine are enormous. The yearning for the restoration of law, order and security, on the one hand, and the arduous task of combating the armed separatist groups, on the other, cannot be overemphasized. Nigeria reaffirms that only a cessation of hostilities and the return to dialogue can present an opportunity for the redress of the humanitarian situation. To that end, we believe that the recommendations contained in the report, which stressed the imperative for the entrenchment of the rule of law, accountability and the administration of justice, are central to the sustainability of peace, security and development in Ukraine. 
The fourth report of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine presents a worrying depiction of the deteriorating human rights and humanitarian situation in the eastern part of the country. It gives an account of extensive breakdown of public utilities as well as a mass exodus of citizens. The intensified clashes between the Ukrainian military and rebel forces over the past few days indicate a collapse of the rule of law, which has led to grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.
To address the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine, the parties to the conflict must engage in direct dialogue with the aim of resolving their differences. There can be no military solution to the conflict. Rather, as we have observed, since the conflict began, that will only exacerbate the political and humanitarian situation and continue to take a toll on innocent civilians. Undoubtedly, efforts by the Government to regain control of the rebel-controlled territories have come at a huge cost in terms of civilian casualties and the destruction of vital infrastructure. It has also led to a rapid escalation of hostilities. We therefore urge the Government to ensure full application of international human rights norms and guarantees.
In the face of the rising number of internally displaced persons (IDPs), we urge all sides to allow free and safe movement of the population. We also reiterate our call for an effective preparedness mechanism that will alleviate any challenges that IDPs might be exposed to, particularly as the winter approaches.
The Government of Ukraine should work stridently to establish a unified registration system for internally displaced persons and exempt humanitarian assistance from taxation. It should also ratify the United Nations-Government customs agreement that would facilitate the entry of humanitarian workers and goods to the region. ","I would like to thank Mr. Šimonović for his briefing.
Jordan has taken note of the contents of the fourth report of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine and the recommendations it contains. In that respect, we would like to express our support for the United Nations efforts and those of the Secretary-General to achieve a peaceful political solution to the conflict in Ukraine. We also urge all parties in Ukraine to cooperate with the United Nations human rights monitoring mission and to guarantee the freedom of its members and their safe and secure access to the various sites throughout Ukraine.
Jordan would like to express its concerns regarding the wide scale chaos and terror and the intimidation, arrests and executions of civilians in eastern Ukraine, as noted in the report, which have resulted in the displacement of a great number of civilians. We would like to reiterate the need for the Ukrainian Government to protect civilians in keeping with international law and applicable international humanitarian norms. We urge the parties to avoid targeting civilians or carrying out reprisals against them and to protect the most vulnerable categories of the population, including children. We urge all parties that possess some sort of influence in Ukraine to work to put an end to the deterioration of the situation in order to create an environment conducive to a political solution to the conflict.
Jordan welcomes the progress achieved by the Ukrainian authorities on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the previous three reports. We call on the Ukrainian authorities to devote greater efforts to promoting the rule of law and human rights, as outlined in the most recent report. We also call on them to work to reform the civilian and security sectors. Similarly, it is essential to be mindful of the concerns of minorities and groups whose primary language is not Ukrainian, in order to achieve a democratic, pluralistic society in which all citizens can enjoy their full rights.
Jordan expresses its concern regarding the deterioration of the security situation in eastern Ukraine and its impact on the investigation of the crash site of the Malaysian aeroplane. All the relevant parties must therefore abide by resolution 2166 (2014), which demands that an end be put to military activities in areas near the crash site in order to guarantee the safety and security of the international investigation.
We urge all parties to exercise restraint and not to resort to hostile acts or engage in provocative actions. It is also essential that they distance themselves from any hate speech and other wrong type of speech to ensure that displaced persons can return to their homes as quickly as possible. ","At the outset, we thank Mr. Ivan Šimonović, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, for his briefing.
Chile reiterates its concern about the human rights situation in eastern Ukraine, in particular in Donetsk and Luhansk, described in the report of United Nations monitoring mission, especially with regard to the allegations of abductions, torture, forced disappearances and other forms of human rights violations and abuses that have affected civilians in the areas controlled by armed groups.
What I have just said underscores the need to establish the rule of law and to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, General Assembly resolution 68/262 and international law. In that context, all actions undertaken by the Government of Ukraine in maintaining public order in its territory must be carried out with full respect for human rights and be proportionate to the situation facing it.
Chile reiterates its strong support for the calls of Mr. Šimonović to ensure accountability for all human rights violations and abuses in Ukraine. We therefore believe that it is essential that the valuable work carried out by human rights monitoring mission in that country be continued.
We would briefly refer to the downing of Flight MH-17 on 17 July, merely to reiterate that the agreed ceasefire should be respected by all parties. Resolution 2166 (2014) should be implemented; it demands the immediate cessation of all military activities, including those of armed groups, in the areas surrounding the accident site, in order to ensure the security of the international investigation team. The Council’s clear message should be heeded by all.
We believe that the human rights violations and abuses are directly related to the deterioration of the humanitarian situation, about which the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs informed us last Tuesday (see S/PV.7234). This is the result of the intensification of fighting on the ground. We would like to reiterate the call that we made previously to the parties that they seek a peaceful solution to the crisis through direct political dialogue, acting with moderation and without taking any unilateral measures that could increase tensions, and participating in international mediation initiatives. We value in particular the role played by the observer mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Here we reiterate once again our gratitude to Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for his briefing. ","I wish to thank Mr. Šimonović for his briefing and to congratulate him for this fourth monthly report of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine. Chad remains deeply concerned at the situation in eastern Ukraine, which, as confirmed by the most recent, has only deteriorated, especially in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which have become zones of intense clashes between the separatists and Government forces. The use of heavy weaponry in and around cities, causing massive destruction of residential neighbourhoods and a great many civilian casualties, the deliberate destruction of health centres and public buildings, leaving entire neighbourhoods without access to water or medical services, make life impossible for those who are not able to flee the fighting. The civilian population thus finds itself taken hostage by the violence and the hostilities.
Chad condemns this increasing violence and calls on Government forces as well as the separatist forces to cease all hostilities immediately and to exercise restraint. Chad deplores the increase in the number of cases of abduction, kidnapping and illegal detention. The United Nations monitoring mission has stated that there were 222 cases of abduction and torture in Ukraine during the past three months.
According to the report, there have been a significant number of forced disappearances and executions carried out by both separatist and Government forces, and there are of course internally displaced persons.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees believes that there are currently 117,000 displaced persons in Ukraine. In his statement made last Tuesday, Mr. John Ging, Director of the Coordination and Response Division of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, stated that there were 4 million individuals at risk living in conflict zones (see S/PV.7234). The situation of children and vulnerable individuals is especially alarming. Faced with this humanitarian disaster, Chad urges the international community to provide logistical, material, technical and financial assistance to the Ukrainian Government as well as to the agencies present on the ground to meet the needs of displaced populations.
Regarding the investigation of the crash of Flight MH-17 and the unanimous adoption of resolution 2166 (2014), the Netherlands announced last Wednesday that as a result of the fighting near the crash site, it would suspend its investigation searching for the remains of victims, which has been carried out for a few days by a hundred or so Dutch, Australian and Malaysian investigators. We deem this situation unacceptable for the families of the victims and call on all parties to respect the joint declaration by the trilateral contact group made up of Russia, Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in which they have committed themselves to provide free access to the MH-17 crash site. ","I would like to thank Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for his briefing.
Today’s meeting of the Security Council follows a national day of mourning in Australia yesterday, when all Australians remembered those who died when Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 was shot down over separatist-held territory in eastern Ukraine. That deplorable crime, unanimously condemned by the Council, is a reminder of the terrible consequences of the violence in eastern Ukraine and of the deliberate actions of armed separatist groups. It is a reminder to all those who stoke the flames of division that fuelling violence has widespread, devastating and often unpredictable consequences. In the days immediately following the adoption of resolution 2166 (2014), an international mission for the protection of the investigation was established, led by the Netherlands, with Australian and Malaysian participation. Despite intimidation by separatists and their frequently imposed restrictions on access to the crash site, the unarmed mission accessed it on a number of occasions, locating and recovering human remains and personal effects and recovering evidence. We worked swiftly and thoroughly in the areas of highest priority, and the mission has now completed the substantive part of its work at the site at this stage. On Wednesday the Netherlands announced the mission’s withdrawal from the site. When search and security conditions improve we will return there to ensure that we have recovered all identifiable remains.
The investigation into the cause of the crash will of course continue, led by the Dutch safety board with input from the International Civil Aviation Organization and other international partners. As with the parallel investigation into possible criminal responsibility for the downing of MH-17, this is again an international effort coordinated by the Dutch. The results of those investigations will be crucial elements in ensuring accountability, as demanded by resolution 2166 (2014), and it is imperative that all States cooperate fully with those efforts.
We are very concerned about what the fourth report on Ukraine by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović today have said. The report tells two stories. In most of Ukraine under Government control, the Government has taken steps towards making constitutional and political reforms, including protecting minority rights, and there has been some movement towards establishing accountability. Judicial reform has also begun, although that needs much more work. Those steps are still incomplete, but they are going in the right direction.
Conversely, the report paints a dire picture of the human-rights situation in separatist-held parts of Ukraine — abductions, torture, extra-judicial killings by armed groups, increasing numbers of civilians killed, deliberate targeting by armed groups of critical public utilities such as water, electricity, sewerage, and growing numbers of internally displaced people. These illegal armed groups have seized Ukrainian territory through violent means and — I quote from paragraph 26 of the report — “inflicted on the populations a reign of intimidation and terror to maintain their position of control”. These groups have no legitimacy; their actions have had terrible consequences. In separatist-controlled areas, as the report says, the rule of law has disappeared and been replaced by the rule of violence. This is now the fourth time that the Council has received a United Nations report documenting these human-rights abuses. The pattern has continued, and in some places under separatist control it has worsened significantly. Those responsible for the violations have acted with impunity. This cannot continue, and they will be held accountable for their crimes.
No country can accept illegally armed insurgents taking control of parts of its territory. In these circumstances of continued destabilization and use of force by separatists, the Ukrainian authorities have the right to protect their own citizens and reassert control over their sovereign territory. They must of course do so in a manner proportionate to the circumstances, and all parties must comply with international humanitarian law. It is self-evident that the human rights and humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine will improve only with an end to the conflict. That requires that separatist groups lay down their arms and cease using violence against the Ukrainian State.
It also requires that Russia stop its provocation and destabilization of eastern Ukraine and use its considerable influence over the separatists to de-escalate the situation. But Russia has not done so. It has not taken action to control its borders. Weapons and fighters continue to flow from Russia into eastern Ukraine, fuelling the conflict. The build-up of Russian troops along the Ukrainian border, the Russian military exercises in the area and the rapid deployment of new and sophisticated military capabilities only add to the destabilization of eastern Ukraine. Serious concerns about Russian military preparedness — what actually looks like combat readiness — are widespread among countries in the region and around the world. Our concerns have been aggravated by Russia’s attempts to construct a case for intervention in eastern Ukraine, a case that is fraudulent and cynically self-serving. The humanitarian problems in eastern Ukraine are a result of the instability and conflict deliberately manufactured by armed groups and supported by Russia. That has inevitably produced a worsening humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine, but effectively one limited to areas occupied by the separatists and certainly not on the scale of what we understand by a humanitarian crisis. Russia can most usefully contribute to alleviating the situation by ending its support for separatist groups and influencing them to end the conflict.
In conclusion, the human-rights situation, the downing of MH-17 and the humanitarian plight of many are all the result of the systematic, manufactured destabilization of eastern Ukraine. The consequences have been grave for Ukraine and its people, and now also for the people of many other countries who have lost their citizens. This destabilization must stop. ",,,,"Thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting. We also thank Mr. Ivan Šimonović, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, for his briefing on the human rights situation in Ukraine. We also commend the entire team of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission, who continue to diligently perform their mission in that difficult environment.
Earlier this week, the Council met on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine (see S/PV.7234). We expressed our concern with regard to the recent developments, including the rapidly growing number of refugees and internally displaced people, as well as the deteriorating humanitarian situation. I would like to recall that, in the same meeting, Rwanda proposed holding a monthly meeting under the agenda item “The situation in Ukraine”, in order to have a comprehensive view and a regular assessment of the crisis in Ukraine, instead of the current ad hoc, piecemeal and letter-based approach.
The report under review gives a gruesome description of the situation in eastern Ukraine. Since April, more than 15,000 innocent civilians have been killed and 4,000 injured. In only five days — between 10 and 15 July — about 478 people were killed, including women and children.
Furthermore, the population in areas controlled by armed groups has been subjected to abduction, arbitrary detention, forced labour and forced recruitment, sexual harassment, torture and execution. On the other hand, Ukrainians, including children, are caught between fights of armies that continue to deploy heavy weaponry in disregard of human life and seriously damaging civilian infrastructure. We agree that this could amount to violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.
Rwanda condemns the use of civilians as human shields by armed groups, such as the incident of 14 June where two people were killed and eight were wounded. We urge all parties involved to act proportionately and to protect civilians as a matter of priority. The issue of abduction and detention is of particular concern, with more than 900 people reported to have been abducted since mid-April, among whom there are a large number of women and girls. The growing trend and tactics being deployed by armed groups, including abduction and torture, is extremely worrying. Also worrying are reported cases of reprisals and illegal detention by the Government, including the illegal detention of a Russian journalist for a long time and in an unknown place, as well the anti-Russian hate speech in the social media and the targeting of Russian-owned banks and businesses. All those serious human rights violations must be thoroughly investigated and those responsible must be held accountable. We urge the human rights monitoring mission and the national preventive mechanism to redouble their efforts in ensuring that human rights are upheld and respected.
With regard to the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, Rwanda remains deeply concerned that the ongoing investigation is being hindered by the fighting around the crash site. It is imperative that the utmost security be guaranteed for the international investigators to carry out their mandate. Let us not forget that the families are still grieving for their loved ones. We owe them respect and the dignity they deserve. The remains of those killed must be immediately returned for proper burial, and the consequences of the plane crash must be determined with a sense of urgency.
Finally, let me reiterate our call for the need to respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. In that regard, we call on all parties to respect the ceasefire, de-escalate the situation and engage in an open political dialogue to find a lasting solution to the crisis, based on President Poroshenko’s peace plan. We do not want to find ourselves with another long-lasting crisis, adding to many others already on the agenda of the Council. We urge all members to consider the lives of Ukrainians and to use any influence they may have to encourage political dialogue. Failure should not be our default option, as it will continue to undermine the credibility of this institution. ","At the outset, I wish to thank Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Ivan Šimonović for his briefing on the human rights situation in Ukraine.
The ongoing deterioration of the security and human rights situation in eastern Ukraine continues to be of great concern. The actions of armed groups, the increased number of armed men and weapons, including heavy weapons, unilateral acts, the intensified fighting and the human rights violations, which seem to be growing, continue to fuel the spiral of violence, threatening to further exacerbate the humanitarian situation. The toll in human lives increases with each violent confrontation, and the situation of the civilians still in the areas of fighting is extremely worrisome. The death of 298 people as a result of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 on 17 July could constitute a war crime, as the Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović has just said. We recall that in resolution 2166 (2014) the Security Council demanded that those responsible be held accountable for their acts.
The human rights violations described in the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights during the reporting period are very worrying. The cases of kidnapping, illegal detention, torture, murder, execution, extortion and destruction of property are unjustifiable. Despite the repeated calls of the international community for all the necessary measures to be taken for the effective prevention and protection of human rights, including economic, social and political rights, and for the guarantee of their full enjoyment by all Ukrainians, irrespective of their ethnicity, language, cultural group, religion and location in the country, the human rights violations seem to have become unremitting. There must be an in-depth investigation of such violations and their perpetrators must be brought to justice.
The risks involved are very high and the possibility of finding a peaceful way out of the crisis is increasingly subject to conditions. The more time passes, the deeper the wounds and the more difficult the reconciliation needed for a lasting peace will become.
Having talked about the humanitarian situation at the most recent meeting of the Council (see S/PV.7234), I will not repeat what we said then about Ukraine but will limit myself to reiterating the urgent call to strictly respect obligations with regard to the protection of civilians in the areas affected by the violence. As noted in the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, all those involved in the hostilities must act in accordance with the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution. We also underscore the need to ensure the conditions for civilians to leave the areas affected by the fighting between the Ukrainian forces and armed groups, to take all appropriate measures for the urgent needs of the displaced to be met and to ensure that assistance reaches those who need it, including in areas not under the Government’s control.
In conclusion, since the Council began to deal with the situation in Ukraine, we have seen almost only its continuous and significant deterioration. The Council, marked by deep divisions on the issue, has not been able to make a decisive contribution to achieving a political and diplomatic solution to the crisis. Furthermore, the efforts of the Secretary-General, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and other actors have not yielded the expected results.
Argentina believes that the Security Council must assume its responsibilities under the Charter and facilitate a political and diplomatic solution to the very worrisome situation facing Ukraine. However, only through the constructive diplomacy of the most influential actors, avoiding belligerent rhetoric, all unilateral acts and any interference in the internal affairs of States, whether military, political or economic, and by working to calm the situation, while exercising maximum self-restraint, can the conditions be established for the urgent process of dialogue to begin.
We emphasize the need to step up efforts in that regard. To that end, it is essential that all actors demonstrate political will and the conviction that the only acceptable way is dialogue and that resorting to violence is not an option. The Geneva and Berlin declarations continue to serve as a road map to advance a process of national dialogue that promotes trust among the various communities and reassures all Ukrainians throughout Ukraine that their main concerns will be addressed. ","I too would like to thank Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for his very thorough briefing on the human-rights situation in Ukraine.
Luxembourg shares the deep concern of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights about the collapse of the rule of law and the worsening violence in the areas of eastern Ukraine controlled by separatist armed groups. The report based on the thorough work of the United Nations human-rights observation mission reveals the seriousness and extent of the human-rights violations committed by these groups. Systematic recourse to intimidation, abductions, forced disappearances, forced recruitment and labour, arbitrary detention, torture, executions, assassination and destruction of civilian infrastructure sows terror among the people. The victims of these heinous acts are not only those who openly oppose the separatists but also ordinary citizens, teachers, journalists, students, women and children. These grave violations of human rights must stop. Those who have committed them must be brought to justice in order to account for their actions.
The situation is especially worrying in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The people there are caught in the crossfire of the intensifying clashes between the Ukrainian security forces and the illegal armed groups, which are increasingly heavily armed. The report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights gives the example of a case in which illegal armed groups used the civilian population as human shields. The report also mentions that these groups are positioning themselves and carrying out their attacks from densely populated areas, thereby endangering the civilian population. Such behaviour is irresponsible. It is unacceptable. All parties must respect international humanitarian law.
We take this opportunity to once again call on Russia to distance itself from the illegal armed groups in the east of Ukraine and to publicly condemn violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed by these groups. For its part, in its operations, Ukraine must act in a proportionate manner, in compliance with international standards, and ensure the protection of civilians.
On a more positive note, there is clear improvement in the human rights situation in Ukrainian cities that have been liberated from the clutches of the separatists. We encourage the Ukrainian authorities to commit to improving the lives of local people, in particular by rebuilding infrastructure and restoring basic services.
The deteriorating situation in eastern Ukraine should not lead us to forget the human rights situation in Crimea. The people of Crimea, especially Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars, who support unity in Ukraine continue to be subjected to intimidation and discrimination. Minorities who have not yet left the peninsula live in an atmosphere of fear. The plight of people affected by HIV and AIDS illustrates the tragic negative impact of the illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 20 patients have died since 10 June due to a lack of proper medical treatment.
At the political and diplomatic levels, all efforts should be aimed at creating conditions conducive to the implementation of President Poroshenko’s peace plan. The talks initiated between Ukraine and Russia under the trilateral contact group, under the auspices of the Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), are essential in that regard. They must continue in order for an agreement to be found as soon as possible on the release of hostages and the establishment of a mechanism to monitor the ceasefire. The OSCE observer mission that has just been deployed to the two border posts at Gukovo and Donetsk on the Russian side of the border is also an element that could help reduce tensions. Russia, for its part, must stop any destabilizing action.
Let me conclude by stating a simple imperative. To honour the memory of the hundreds of victims of the conflict in Ukraine, including the 298 people aboard Flight MH-17, which was shot down three weeks ago, we must redouble our diplomatic efforts to find a political solution to this conflict as soon as possible in accordance with President Poroshenko’s peace plan. We owe it to the millions of civilians who want respect for their most basic rights and do not want to be the victims of a conflict that dates back to another era. ","I thank Assistant Secretary-General Ivan Šimonović for his briefing.
We also appreciate the dedicated work of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine and welcome its fourth report, which provides a clear assessment of the situation on the ground. As the report elaborates in detail, the continuing violence in eastern Ukraine has resulted in a growing number of casualties and a further deterioration of the human rights situation. We are troubled that illegal armed groups have committed serious human rights violations, including abductions, arbitrary detentions, torture, harassment and killings. New allegations of military tribunals and execution orders by armed groups are particularly alarming. All allegations of such egregious crimes must be investigated thoroughly, and the perpetrators must be held accountable.
Meanwhile, it is worrisome that the situation in the east is now affecting the border region of Ukraine, along with a significant increase in the number of people fleeing the eastern region. Hate speech is also deepening divisions between communities and fueling tensions.
In the light of such a volatile situation, we believe that the only way out of the crisis is an immediate cessation of all hostilities through constructive dialogue. To achieve that, it is of paramount importance that all parties agree on an immediate, genuine and durable ceasefire, building upon relevant agreements, including the Berlin Joint Declaration.
At the same time, the illegal armed groups must lay down their arms and stop provocative actions aimed at destabilizing Ukraine. We support the critical role of the trilateral contact group and the observer mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe at the Russian-Ukrainian border in de-escalating intentions to create the conditions for a political process.
Before concluding, we once again call attention to the importance of a full, thorough and independent international investigation of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. All concerned parties must comply with their obligations under resolution 2166 (2014) and fully cooperate with such an investigation.
Despite ongoing tensions on the ground, we continue to believe that a political solution is necessary and attainable. There is not a moment to lose. With that shared sense of urgency, we once again encourage all concerned parties to continue exerting maximum efforts to seek a peaceful political solution. "
S/PV.7234,41767,Discussion of the humanitarian situation in Donbas and East Ukraine,"I wish to thank Mr. Ging of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for his briefing. Recently, the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine has continued to escalate, causing increasing civilian casualties and a dire humanitarian situation, which continues to deteriorate. China is deeply worried about the situation. We hope that the international community will play a constructive role in easing the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine and that United Nations humanitarian agencies will strictly abide by the principle of neutrality and objectivity. We now face the urgent task of engaging in political consultations with a view to achieving a ceasefire as soon as possible and engaging in comprehensive dialogue, which is the only way out of the Ukrainian crisis. The parties concerned should remain calm and maintain restraint, respect the Charter of the United Nations, work on the basis of the various initiatives, including the Geneva agreement, step up dialogue and consultation, meet each other half way, respect the role of current dialogue and liaison mechanisms and seek a comprehensive settlement through peaceful means. A political settlement to the Ukrainian crisis should include the legitimate claims of various areas and ethnic groups and realize a balance of interests. The international community should do more to promote peace and dialogue and should create favourable conditions for the parties concerned to maintain dialogue and engagement and make a constructive effort to achieve political progress in the Ukrainian crisis. China supports all efforts aimed at easing the tension, resolving the crisis and achieving the proposed political settlement, and will continue to play a constructive role.","I would like to thank Mr. John Ging from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for his briefing. He has told us that the humanitarian situation is worsening and he has described how the Ukrainian authorities are dealing with that situation with the support of the international community. The number of internally displaced persons is increasing, as pointed out by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Why is that the case? It is because people are fleeing the fighting precipitated by the separatists, who have refused to accept the hand extended by President Poroshenko. It is because people are fleeing separatist attacks in the areas they control — attacks that are becoming deadlier every day. The report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights that the Security Council will consider in the near future is very eloquent in that regard. In fact, no report mentions instances of people fleeing cities in which Ukrainian armed forces have restored public order and the rule of law. Wherever Kyiv has re-established its authority, public services and basic services have been restored to the population. According to statements by UNHCR, the return of the internally displaced persons to areas now controlled by the Government serves to clearly indicate that the separatists were the main cause of the displacement. The worsening humanitarian situation is also a result of the presence of armed combatants coming from outside of Ukraine. The question of external support with regard to recruitment, the provision of equipment and training is increasingly urgent and requires the attention of the international community. Those who arm the criminals who are terrorizing the population are responsible for the worsening humanitarian situation. All those events demonstrate the pressing need for international cooperation in order to stabilize the situation in Ukraine and ensure its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We call for a sincere commitment by the Russian Federation, which has so far been lacking. Despite the number of appeals made to President Putin, we regret the fact that the Russian Federation has not put pressure on the separatists in order to bring them to the negotiating table and has not taken the expected concrete measures in order to ensure control of the Russian/Ukrainian border. We are also extremely vigilant with regard to any direct military support that the Russian Federation could give to the separatists in the fighting. In that context, new measures against the Russian Federation were taken by the European Union, but also by a number of its partners — including the United States and, later, Japan and Switzerland. That step shows that there is unanimity in the international community in condemning the lack of coordination by the Russian Federation. The message is clear: the fleeing must end. The Russian Federation can choose to de-escalate the situation. The tightening of sanctions has only one goal, that is, to facilitate the emergence of a political solution. Our priority continues to be, first of all, to put an end to the escalation and to establish a lasting ceasefire among all parties. We call upon the Russian Federation to involve itself in a constructive way in that endeavour and to use its influence with the armed groups to convince them to put down their arms and engage in dialogue.","We thank the Director of the Coordination and Response Division of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Mr. John Ging, for his briefing on the situation in eastern Ukraine. We think that OCHA and other humanitarian agencies should regularly inform the Security Council of the humanitarian situation in the region and provide objective statistics on the situation of civilians, including data on those wounded or killed, as well as on the destruction of civilian infrastructure. On a human scale, the situation in the east, particularly in Donetsk and Luhansk, is disastrous. Today there is a definite need to speak about a true war. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has officially recognized that there is an internal armed conflict in the east of Ukraine. In spite of international agreements, including the 17 April Geneva agreement and the 2 July Berlin agreement, both of which were signed onto by the Ukrainian Government, Kyiv continues to step up its military operations, taking hundreds and thousands of lives with it. According to information we have received, the punitive militia are playing a leading role. They are subordinate to no armed forces in Ukraine. They are carrying the orders of certain leaders of the Security Council of the country and are financed by local oligarchs. Overflights of cities have become a daily reality. Artillery, tanks and Grad rockets are used. Locals are continuously reporting that phosphorous bombs and cluster bombs are being used. There is indiscriminate shelling of housing blocks and critical civilian infrastructure. In many small towns, about 80 per cent of the houses have been destroyed. According to most conservative estimates, more than 600 buildings have been reduced to rubble. Today there was a rocket attack in Shakhtyorsk. On 2 August, Ukrainian artillery shelled the city of Pervamaisk, where homes, two electrical power plants and hospitals were destroyed. As a result of shelling by the Ukrainian armed forces, shells have been falling into Russia. There have been about 20 such incidents. On 3 August, a Ukrainian army mine exploded at the Gukovo crossing, Rostov oblast, where monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were working. According to the most conservative estimates by international humanitarian agencies, more than 1,367 people have been killed and thousands have been wounded, including children. Those are worrisome numbers. In one day alone, 40 people were killed in the city of Golov. More than 4 million people live in the areas where military operations are taking place. Of them, more than 200,000 have been left without drinking water. There is a critical health and epidemiological situation in Luhansk. Houses are without electricity and, because of shelling, there is no clean water. Telephone communications are impaired and there are no garbage removal services. Ukrainians have begun to leave the country en masse. Almost 800,000 Ukrainians have come to Russia since the beginning of the crisis. Some — about 170,000 of them — have come to Russian migration services to legalize their situation. Centres have been opened for refugees. Our country stands ready to undertake that great burden. We do not need material assistance from outside. We stand ready to provide human assistance to Ukrainians on our own. The most dramatic situation in the east of Ukraine is on the health front. The majority of doctors have been evacuated. It must be understood that in the areas where military clashes are taking place the most vulnerable have been left behind, and they have no way of leaving. It seems that the Kyiv authorities are not interested at all. We have made multiple appeals to them to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate children and the vulnerable, including orphans. We have also appealed to them to allow humanitarian assistance from Russia to be let in. But Kyiv has rejected all of those proposals. Russia calls upon the international community to take emergency measures to improve the humanitarian situation in the east of Ukraine. Because of that, on 4 August, Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Sergey Lavrov, once again sent an official appeal to humanitarian agencies associated with the United Nations, the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the ICRC to create a humanitarian mission. We would like to send a convoy with Russian humanitarian assistance under the aegis and with the support of the ICRC to Donetsk and Luhansk and other areas of Ukraine where internally displaced persons from the east are concentrated. We stand ready to act with full transparency. We will allow the International Committee of the Red Cross monitor the convoys, their transport routes and the distribution of aid. We think that, first and foremost, there is a need to provide food, medicine and medical equipment, as well as water purification systems and generators. There are many cases in which providing assistance to civilians suffering from an armed conflict is very difficult. That applies, for example, to the situations in the areas controlled by terrorist organizations in South Sudan, Iraq and Syria. The situation in eastern Ukraine demands that an end be put to the political posturing and that international humanitarian principles be genuinely respected. Finally, Kyiv’s approach of violently repressing the eastern regions will have very difficult consequences for the entire Ukrainian population, and that is simply regrettable. Unfortunately, a number of members of the Security Council have not heeded our call to reject any politicizing of this discussion of the humanitarian situation in the eastern part of Ukraine on the provision of humanitarian assistance to the population in need. Someone, as always, has protected the Kyivan authorities by distorting the role of the Russian Federation, others have repeated speeches that they have given previously in Security Council meetings, and some have said that the killing and wounding of individuals as a result of the armed conflict in Ukraine is not worthy of a separate discussion. Such propaganda was repeated by the representative of Ukraine as well. We are grateful to those members of the Council who shared our concern and our alarm. We would like to once again reaffirm our readiness to closely cooperate with the humanitarian agencies and all relevant organizations and institutions that not only can but must play their role in providing assistance and help to the people of eastern Ukraine. We cherish the hope that today’s Council meeting will serve to promote the coordination of our common efforts with them.","As this is the first public meeting of the Security Council for the month of August 2014, I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute, on behalf of the Council, to His Excellency Mr. Eugène-Richard Gasana, Permanent Representative of Rwanda, for his service as President of the Council during the month of July. I am sure that I speak for all members of the Council in expressing deep appreciation to Ambassador Gasana and his team for the great diplomatic skill with which they conducted the Council’s business last month. In accordance with rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite the representative of Ukraine to participate in this meeting. In accordance with rule 39 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite Mr. John Ging, Director of the Coordination and Response Division of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, to participate in this meeting. The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. I give the floor to Mr. Ging. I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the United Kingdom. I thank Mr. Ging for his briefing this afternoon. As we have heard from him, the situation in separatist-held areas of eastern Ukraine continues to deteriorate. The number of casualties is rising, public infrastructure is failing and the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) is growing. Thankfully, we do not have in Ukraine a situation that is comparable to humanitarian crises elsewhere. But that is of little comfort to those Ukrainian civilians who are experiencing increasing levels of daily hardship. Let us be absolutely clear: it is the continuing separatist violence that is responsible for the worsening humanitarian situation in the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. Where there are no separatists there is no humanitarian distress. In those cities and towns that have been liberated by the Ukrainian Government, life is returning to normal, IDPs are returning to their homes and the Ukrainian Government is working to repair and re-establish public services. There have been no reprisals. In contrast, in those areas that remain under separatist control, civilians are increasingly vulnerable. The United Nations reports that separatists have deliberately targeted critical public utilities, including water, electricity and sewage plants. They have replaced the rule of law with what the United Nations describes as the rule of violence, thereby creating an atmosphere of fear, intimidation and harassment. The latest report of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission, released on 15 July, leaves little doubt about the violent and abusive nature of the separatist groups. It describes in detail their abduction of civilians, their looting, their torture, their killings and their executions of civilians. Recent reports indicate that separatist groups have been refusing to allow fighting-aged men to evacuate the areas under its control. These illegal armed separatist groups have no grounds to pursue their campaign of violence. They must lay down their arms, vacate all illegally seized-Government buildings and address their grievances through exclusively peaceful and democratic means. But we must also address the root causes of the situation, and not just focus on its symptoms. Despite professing concern for Ukrainian citizens in the east, Russia has at no point called upon the separatists to cease their violent and illegal insurgency. Instead, it has fuelled the crisis, sustained the violence and prolonged the humanitarian distress. It has been equipping separatists with sophisticated heavy weaponry, including Grad rocket launchers and artillery, tanks and surface-to-air missiles. It has been recruiting and training fighters and waging a propaganda war on their behalf. There has even been been direct shelling of Ukraine from Russian territory. The truth of the matter is that this is not an insurrection born in the Donbass; it is an insurgency manufactured in Moscow. It is led by Russians using Russian-supplied weapons in a deliberate effort to destabilize Ukraine and to exert control over Kyiv. The profile of the separatist leaders makes that abundantly clear. Last month, Vladimir Antyufeyev joined the ranks of the separatists’ military command alongside, Igor Strelkov and Alexander Borodai. Antyufeyev is wanted for his role in suppressing pro-independence demonstrations in Latvia in 1991 and was most recently the KGB chief in Transnistria. All three of those individuals are Russian citizens and all three have worked for Russian intelligence. It is deeply ironic that Russia should call for an emergency meeting for the Security Council to discuss a humanitarian crisis largely of its own creation. We agree that there needs to be an end to the violence. We agree that alleviating humanitarian distress is a matter of priority. But Russia cannot credibly present itself as supporting the people of eastern Ukraine when it is the architect of the violence that afflicts them. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. I give the floor to Mr. Ging to respond to the questions raised.","I thank Mr. Ging for his briefing. As a result of the ongoing violence in eastern Ukraine, thousands of Ukrainians have had to flee their homes. Many have been subjected to harassment, arbitrary detention and killing at the hands of Russian-supported separatists. The general environment of insecurity and instability has contributed to a growing number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) inside Ukraine and in those seeking refuge outside of Ukraine. To address the serious situation, the Government and the people of Ukraine have undertaken important steps to provide humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons throughout the country. We commend the quick response of the Ukrainian Government in the areas recently liberated from separatists’ control. Electricity and water services are coming back on, pensions are being paid again and rebuilding has already begun. For those who have not yet been able to return home, a rapid, coordinated effort by Ukraine and the international humanitarian community is essential to identify and respond to the urgent needs of the most vulnerable. To that end, we encourage Ukraine to coordinate quickly a comprehensive IDP registration system, ensure the harmonization of assistance efforts and assist in disseminating information on registration procedures and services. Doing so will allow for the targeted delivery of assistance, to which international donors can more effectively respond. It will also pave the way for a calibrated response to the unique needs of IDPs. We commend the United Nations for mobilizing so quickly to support the Government of Ukraine’s efforts. Regarding Russia’s call for a humanitarian mission in Ukraine, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations are already on the ground carrying out assessment missions and providing assistance to vulnerable, conflict-affected persons, particularly those in liberated areas. Those organizations are standing by and are ready to provide more assistance to conflict areas if permitted greater access and security guarantees by Russia-backed separatists. When addressing the humanitarian situation, we cannot lose sight of one underlying fact: Russia can stop all of this. The surest way to end the violence is for Russia to stop the flow of fighters, weapons and money from Russia into eastern Ukraine. Russia has the ability to get the separatists it supports to lay down their arms, sit at the negotiating table and work to implement President Poroshenko’s peace plan. Russia must also respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and end its occupation of Crimea. Yet instead of positive steps, Russia has nearly doubled the number of its battalions near the Ukrainian border. Equally troubling is Russia’s plan to conduct a large military exercise near the Ukrainian border, which will only serve to escalate tensions. We again demand that Russia halt any and all destabilizing actions. We understand that Russia has expressed its concern over the plight of displaced persons and refugees. Therefore, we call on Russia to allow an independent assessment of humanitarian needs within Russia and along the Ukrainian border so that the international community can better understand the scale of the issue and so that assistance can be made available. Otherwise, there is no way to verify the scale of the outflow to Russia. I want to note that nearly a month has passed since the Council agreed to support in every way a full, thorough and independent investigation into the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. We commend the Government of Ukraine for its cooperation with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the Netherlands, Australia and Malaysia in coordinating the investigation and allowing Dutch, Australian and Malaysian police to secure the crash site. We also hold all sides accountable for the commitment they made on 31 July to protect the integrity of the site and secure safe access for international investigators. Bodies remain unaccounted for and there are personal effects that still need to be retrieved. Finally, we appreciate the ability of the Secretariat to arrange emergency briefings on short notice. There are times when such urgency is merited. We question whether the situation we are discussing today meets the standard of urgency, especially as we will be discussing the overall situation in Ukraine on Friday.",,,,,,,,,,,"I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this important meeting on the current situation in my country. Let me also thank Mr. Ging for his briefing today.
My delegation would like to express its appreciation to those who are engaged in providing assistance to the Government of Ukraine to address humanitarian issues in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk affected by the activities of terrorists. We value the efforts of the United Nations and other organizations aimed at addressing humanitarian needs. I want to assure the Council that the Government of Ukraine gives due consideration to all the recommendations of the United Nations and other international players.
As my delegation has stated previously, there is no humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, as continually portrayed by our Russian colleagues. It is evident, though, that the humanitarian situation in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions remains serious. However, the situation is manageable by the Government of Ukraine, which remains open to cooperation with international partners. Significant humanitarian difficulties currently exist only in those cities that are temporarily under the control of the terrorist groups supported by Russia. Their actions have already led to a disruption of work, water and electricity supply facilities, and other utilities vital to the normal life of the population.
Meanwhile, the Government of Ukraine is ensuring the fulfilment of all of its social obligations regarding retirement payments, social benefits and salaries in the public sector to the population throughout the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, except in certain towns that remain under the control of the terrorists.
The restoration and reconstruction of the territories affected by the terrorists are among the top priorities of the Ukrainian Government. As the Council might be aware, the terrorists have now been pushed out of the city of Slavyansk and many other towns and villages, which are now being restored to normal life. A few days ago, the President of Ukraine announced the establishment of the foundation on international aid to Donbass. We are pleased that many countries have agreed to make significant contributions, which will allow us to ease the burden of the recovery.
What our Russian colleagues continue to say about the situation in Ukraine, as well as their proposal on the so-called international humanitarian mission in Donbass, sounds very cynical. This is Russia, which continues to destabilize the situation in the east of Ukraine. Russia is supporting the activities of the terrorists and bears full responsibility for the humanitarian problems in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
In addition to the deliberate destruction of vital infrastructure and buildings in the region and of water and electricity supply systems, the terrorists from the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic, which include a large number of Russian citizens, are carrying out attacks on medical units and personnel, fire on hospitals with explosive weapons, compromise the ability of civilian patients to receive treatment, and expropriate ambulances.
Human Rights Watch, in its report, condemned those acts by pro-Russian fighters and called on them to cease immediately. On the other hand, the anti-terrorist forces, which successfully freed the cities of the Donbass region from the terrorists, are restoring peace to its citizens, providing for the gradual restoration of infrastructure and helping them return to normal life.
Since June, the inter-agency coordination unit, which includes representatives of the United Nations system and the International Committee of the Red Cross, has been operating successfully in Ukraine to ensure that the urgent humanitarian needs of the civilian population and internally displaced persons are met.
Upon the instruction of the President of Ukraine, humanitarian corridors have been established for anyone who wishes to leave the anti-terrorist operation area. Unfortunately, the corridors are not able to operate fully today due to the activities of the illegal armed groups.
The State service for emergencies was charged with establishing a multi-task coordination centre in order to transport the persons affected as well as to meet the health-care and social needs of civilians.
The real cause of the current humanitarian difficulties in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions is the activities of the terrorists and illegal armed groups supported by Russia. Those groups are intimidating the local population, disrupting the normal functioning of city infrastructures and normal life, and robbing and kidnapping people. All humanitarian problems will be eliminated as soon as Russia stops supporting the terrorists and illegal armed groups operating in the east of Ukraine.
We demand that Russia take under effective control its part of the border and stop the flow of illegal armed groups, weapons and now heavy military machinery. Unfortunately, our calls on the Russian Federation to fulfil its obligations under the Geneva statement have not been heard. Russia continues to destabilize the situation in the eastern part of Ukraine.
Let me provide you with some recent information that reflects the reality of the situation.
I am now wrapping up. Russia continues to shell the settlements and positions of the armed forces of Ukraine near the State border from Russian territory. The number of Russian armed forces, heavy armoured vehicles and troops positioned along the Russian-Ukrainian border has been constantly increasing. The shelling has resulted in casualties among civilians and soldiers, and destroyed residential, administrative and commercial buildings.
If the Russian Federation is truly interested in the stabilization of the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, we propose just a few easy steps to be taken by Russia: that it stop sending mercenaries as well as weapons and ammunition to the territory of Ukraine; establish effective control over its part of the border to prevent the infiltration of illegal armed troops and weapons; stop provoking instability; and withdraw all military and paramilitary formations of the Russian armed forces from Ukrainian borders. We are confident that the sooner the aforementioned steps are taken by the Russian Federation, the sooner the situation in my country will stabilize and return to normal. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I thank Mr. John Ging, Director of the Coordination and Response Division of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, for his briefing.
Perhaps no other crisis has given rise to as many meetings this year as the situation in Ukraine. The number has, if I am correct, surpassed 20 and counting. Reports on the situation on the ground provided by the monitoring mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and other institutions have been essential in understanding the real situation on the ground. Earlier today, my delegation requested a briefing on the fourth report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights later this week.
As the fourth report — which, as previous speakers have mentioned, we will have another occasion to discuss very soon — makes clear, the rule of law has collapsed in the areas controlled by the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic and has been replaced by the rule of lawlessness.
Illegal armed groups are increasingly well equipped, with heavy weaponry, tanks and armoured vehicles capable of inflicting major damage and losses to the Ukrainian troops.
Abductions and detentions of civilians, torture and ill-treatment continue in the parts controlled by pro-Russian militant separatist groups. Local administration buildings are still occupied, illegal parallel institutions are being put into place, and separatist leaders announce summary executions to maintain order in their ranks. Fighters take selfies with the remains of killed Ukrainian soldiers. Last Friday, the self-proclaimed defence minister, Igor Girkin, declared a state of siege and the introduction of martial law in Donetsk. Warnings were issued that all troublemakers would be sent directly to courts martial.
Pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine have threatened medical staff, stolen and destroyed medical equipment and hospital furniture, compromised the ability of civilian patients to receive treatment and expropriated ambulances and used them to transport active fighters, as documented by non-governmental organizations. Attacks on hospitals with explosive weapons have also been reported. Such acts are strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law, which provides for special protections to medical units and personnel and to the wounded and sick.
In Crimea, in contravention of General Assembly resolution 68/262, the laws and regulations of the Russian Federation are being applied, causing confusion and jeopardizing the rights of all those who are reluctant to take Russian citizenship. Harassment of and discrimination against the indigenous population of the Crimean Tatars and religious and other minorities continue to take place.
No wonder the humanitarian situation is deteriorating in areas under the illegal rule of armed separatist groups. According to figures recently released by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, some 117,000 people are displaced inside Ukraine and, as of 1 August, an estimated 168,000 people had left the country for Russia. In just the past seven days, more than 6,000 people have been forced from their homes. Deliberate targeting by armed groups of critical utilities and illegal seizures of public and private property continue to take place.
Armed separatist groups do not shy away from installing themselves among civilian populations, in the midst of towns, as they retreat under the pressure of Ukrainian forces. One recent example involved Ukrainian attempts to recapture the town of Yasinovataya, north of Donetsk. A few days ago, Ukrainian forces entered Yasinovataya, but due to the threat to the lives of civilians, a commander took the decision to return to their original positions on the outskirts of the town to avoid harming the local population. Sources on the ground note that the tendency over the recent days has been that when Ukrainian troops deploy sufficient manpower and firepower to pose a threat to the militants, the illegal armed groups redeploy to a nearby town, forcing the local population to flee as they install their armed vehicles, artillery and Grad rockets in residential areas.
As fighting continues, Ukrainian authorities have been doing what they can to issue advance warnings to the civilian populations and establish unilateral humanitarian corridors in Donetsk, Luhansk and Horlivka in order to enable the population to leave combat areas. Ukraine, like any other country, has the right and duty to restore law and order within its borders and to protect its unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity. We reiterate the need for the Ukrainian forces to take all the necessary measures to prevent damage to civilian infrastructure and civilian casualties. At the same time, the efforts of the Ukrainian Government to continue the overall reform process of addressing the ills inherited from the previous regime must continue.
On many occasions in the Council, we have called for de-escalation. De-escalation, however, can never be interpreted as Ukraine’s unilateral surrender and acceptance of the dismemberment of the State. Russia, which has from the very beginning stoked the illegal war carried out by militant separatists against Ukraine, could have prevented the current humanitarian situation from developing long ago by disassociating itself from the militant separatism in eastern Ukraine, by cutting off all support for the insurgents, by securing its borders and by stopping the flow of Russian-made weaponry. As the Ukrainian forces do what they can to free the terrain from illegal armed groups and to ensure the unity of the State, we may have to wait a long time for any of that to happen.","First, Mr. President, we share fully your words of commendation directed towards the delegation of Rwanda for its capable leadership of the Council during the past month. I should also like to thank Mr. John Ging, Director of the Coordination and Response Division of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), for his briefing.
Only yesterday, Europe and the rest of the world solemnly commemorated the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War. Today, the people of Ukraine and eastern Europe are experiencing the misery felt by the people of Belgium and France 100 years ago.
Mr. Ging’s briefing today is evidently disconcerting. Nearly 4 million people are trapped in the conflict area in southern and eastern Ukraine. According to recent reports, Luhansk in eastern Ukraine is on the verge of a humanitarian disaster, with 230,000 people internally displaced due to the conflict.
The conflict has led to a scarcity of available drinking water, an indispensable and essential factor of life; and the shutdown of the power grid that supplies electricity to homes, schools and hospitals. Every new day brings new tales of death and destruction. With gas reserves exhausted and the shortfall in medical supplies, the population is understandably eager to evacuate tumultuous cities.
The net result of the crisis is a mass exodus, as innocent civilians flee deprivation and the incessant violence. As the conflict in southern and eastern Ukraine intensifies, support and solidarity from the international community becomes increasingly important. In that connection, we take positive note of the preliminary response plan developed by the humanitarian community, which lays the foundation for the future humanitarian response in Ukraine, based on an overarching structured goal and the four strategy objectives that will guide sector-specific action and response. We commend OCHA for being central to those planning and response strategies.
Once again, the leadership role of the United Nations in addressing humanitarian issues and concerns across the globe has been demonstrated. We urge the relevant agencies to remain engaged with the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine until it stabilizes.
We also call on the authorities in that country to take steps and measures to ensure the establishment of an effective system to engender the coordination and implementation of relief efforts. There is no doubt that the humanitarian situation is an outcome of the conflict in that country, which has intensified and assumed a perilous scale. The only sustainable solution to the humanitarian situation, and indeed to the overall situation in that country, is the cessation of hostilities and a return to dialogue.
In that regard, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe road map for de-escalating tensions in Ukraine and the 17 April Geneva agreement presents viable avenues to pursue a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine.
Mr. President, if you allow me a few seconds, I should like to just ask two questions of the OCHA Director, to take advantage of his presence. First, is the unified registration system for internally displaced persons (IDPs) that he mentioned being examined positively by the Ukrainian authorities with a view to its adoption? Secondly, we understand that winter conditions in that part of the world can be very severe. Is OCHA and the rest of the international humanitarian community putting in place some measures to cater to IDPs and refugees in case the conflict is not resolved now and spills over into the winter period? ","I would like to thank Mr. Ging for his briefing.
The increasing hostilities in eastern Ukraine are a cause of concern for the Government of Jordan, in particular in the light of the reports of the worsening humanitarian situation and the growing number of people killed and injured. We call on all parties to show restraint, to calm all actors and to refrain from engaging in any hostile or provocative act.
Jordan would like to emphasize the right of States under international law to extend their authority throughout their territory and to protect their citizens from threats. In that regard, the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine must be fully respected. We call on the Government of Ukraine to ensure that international norms are upheld with regard to respect for human rights in applying the law. We reiterate the need to ensure the protection of civilians and to avoid using civilians as targets or undertaking any reprisals against them.
A political solution is the only way to re-establish stability in eastern Ukraine. We therefore reiterate our appeal to all the relevant parties in Ukraine to do their utmost to find a political solution to the crisis, to stop the escalation of violence and to call on combatants to put down their weapons in order to re-establish stability in the eastern part of the country. We also call for the return of internally displaced persons as soon as possible.
We urge the parties to respect the provisions of the Geneva declaration and to facilitate access for the United Nations human rights monitoring mission, as well as to ensure the rights of journalists, in particular in the eastern part of the country. ","At the outset, we thank the Director of the Coordination and Response Division of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for his briefing on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine.
We regret the worsening humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine as a result of the escalation in the fighting, particularly in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Chile is very concerned about the security of those who are trapped in the conflict zone and the increase in deliberate attacks on civilian facilities, including basic infrastructure such as electricity and water, as well as housing and public buildings. It is worrying that access to drinking water in those zones has decreased, with an impact on the population.
The worsening situation is also reflected in the increase in the numbers of internally displaced persons and people who who have crossed borders. We are particularly concerned that this group of individuals are mainly made up of women, boys and girls. We reiterate that any response strategy must address the special needs of girls and adolescents, as they are doubly vulnerable.
In that regard, we support the recommendations made by the United Nations in connection with the need for the Ukrainian Government to establish a unified and centralized registration system to document the movement of internally displaced persons and to assess in the best way possible how to meet their needs.
We reiterate that there is also a need for the United Nations to be present on the ground in support of national authorities. In that connection, we welcome the development by OCHA and other members of the humanitarian community of a preliminary response plan that will lay the foundations for the future humanitarian response in Ukraine. We hope that the donor community will support that appeal.
In conclusion, we urge the parties to find a peaceful solution to the crisis through direct political dialogue, to act with moderation and refrain from taking unilateral measures, which could increase the tension, and to participate in international mediation efforts.
We would like to reiterate our appreciation for the ongoing efforts of the Secretary-General and the United Nations, through its various agencies to put an end to the situation being experienced by Ukraine. We also trust that the various independent international mechanisms will be able to continue to contribute towards the search for a solution to the crisis. ","I would like to start by thanking Mr. John Ging of the the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for his briefing.
The intense clashes between Ukrainian forces and separatists in eastern Ukraine is occurring in urban centres, with civilians caught in the crossfire. Many civilians have been killed or wounded recently. Certain sources refer to the use of Grad rockets in inhabited areas, which is a serious crime. Civilians continue to flee in large numbers and those who remain have to face various shortages and violations. Health centres and hospitals in Donetsk and Slavyansk have been occupied, preventing civilians from receiving treatment. We call upon both sides to respect the norms of international humanitarian law. Attacks and reprisals risk worsening the situation, which will no doubt have a negative impact on the civilian population.
In conclusion, we are convinced that only an inclusive and constructive dialogue could lead us to an unfreezing of the situation that Ukraine is currently experiencing. Ukrainians have the right to peace just like all the other peoples of the world. ","I thank Mr. John Ging for his briefing this afternoon. I would also like to thank the United Nations agencies that are already working on the ground in Ukraine for their efforts.
The continuing conflict in eastern Ukraine has inevitably produced a humanitarian situation that is worsening. There has been further displacement of civilians and disruption of the provision of essential services. Advice from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs that the conflict has resulted in displacing 117,000 persons and that a further 163,000 have fled Ukraine is troubling. Reports of armed groups deliberately targeting civilian facilities such as electricity and water plants, roads and bridges are alarming. Such attacks on facilities that are necessary in order to sustain the well-being — indeed, the lives — of civilians must cease. Civilian infrastructure must be protected and respected. All parties to the conflict must comply with international humanitarian law. We commend the United Nations and other humanitarian actors for their efforts to respond to the needs of displaced people and host communities. We welcome the determination of the Ukrainian authorities to ensure that the needs of the Ukrainian people who have been displaced or affected by violence are met. We endorse calls for a systematic registration system to facilite that. Continued cooperation between the United Nations and the Ukrainian authorities is essential in planning and implementing the humanitarian response. In that regard, we look forward to the preliminary response plan developed by the humanitarian community, which we understand is to be released this week. Obviously, to restore essential services and protect civilians caught up in the conflict, it is necessary that all violence cease and that all parties commit to and embark on genuine dialogue. We commend the efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to promote dialogue, including through the trilateral contact group, We welcome the start of the Minsk talks, but they must deliver. In order for them to do so, it is essential that all support for armed groups operating in eastern Ukraine stop.
As we know only too well, it is just slightly less than three weeks ago that Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed over separatist-held territory in eastern Ukraine, with the terrible loss of 298 lives. Their deaths were a direct consequence of this needless violence in eastern Ukraine. The Council, through resolution 2166 (2014), rightly demanded a full, thorough and independent international investigation into the MH-17 incident. It also demanded immediate and unrestricted access to the site to allow for the investigation and recovery of the bodies, prohibited any actions that could compromise the integrity of the site, most notably by local armed groups, and insisted that those responsible be held accountable. Two weeks later, we still need the full and urgent implementation of that resolution. Although some access to the crash site has been secured, we still do not have the unimpeded and complete access to the whole of the site that is essential.
Last Friday, on 1 August, the Netherlands informed the Council of the establishment of the international mission to protect the investigation, led by the Netherlands, with the participation of Australia and Malaysia. Unarmed Dutch, Australian and Malaysian personnel have been assisting with the investigation and the removal of the remaining bodies and belongings, as well as securing the wreckage and physical evidence. This is an unarmed operation of limited scope and duration. Personnel have been working closely and meticulously through the OSCE, which is negotiating site access and local ceasefires on their behalf. But that has not always enabled the access required to complete the essential tasks. The area around the site remains contested. Although today we had the cooperation of the Ukrainian authorities, armed separatists restricted access to several areas of the crash site, hampering the investigation and the recovery of remains and personal effects. Urgent, unrestricted access to every area of the site, in accordance with the unambiguous, plain provisions of resolution 2166 (2014), remains imperative. The unarmed personnel on the ground need the Council’s own demands to be met in order to undertake their work. The sooner they can achieve full, free access, the sooner they will be able to complete their work.
To conclude, a lasting solution to the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine self-evidently requires an end to the conflict. The Council has repeatedly urged that, and the information we have received today only reaffirms for us the importance of bringing to an end the impact of the violence and destabilizing activities in the east of Ukraine. ",,,,"I wish to thank you, Mr. President, for having convened this emergency meeting on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine and for your kind words to Mr. Gasana and the delegation of Rwanda concerning the presidency in July.
Let me also thank John Ging, Director of the Coordination and Response Division of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), for his briefing.
The humanitarian crisis in eastern Ukraine, especially in the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, has fast deteriorated over the past weeks. The violence continues to put the lives of Ukrainians in grave danger, particularly women and children; 3.9 million people live in areas affected by violence, a number of them deprived of basic services, including water, electricity and health services. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations refugee agency, reported that 117,000 people have been displaced inside Ukraine and that a total of 740,000 people have crossed into the Russian Federation since the beginning of the year.
Some are displaced because of fear of persecution for political views, ethnicity and possible recruitment in eastern Ukraine, but the large majority are Ukrainians caught in the crossfire, fearing for their own security and seeking a safe location. We commend United Nations agencies and other humanitarian actors for their work on the ground, and we support UNHCR’s call for the establishment by the Ukrainian Government of a central registration system for internally displaced persons.
Meanwhile, Rwanda is concerned at the continued fighting around the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, preventing international investigators from doing their work. Those continued violations of resolution 2166 (2014) cannot be tolerated, particularly as we know that some family members have not been able to receive the remains of their loved ones. We renew our call on all parties — as they committed themselves to doing on 31 July — to allow unhindered access in and around sites so that the investigators can safely perform their duties in an expedited manner. Given that context, it is unfortunate that the Council continues to be deeply divided on the crisis in Ukraine. The risk of a full-blown war will remain as long as there is division among Council members. Also, the worsening humanitarian situation in Ukraine, although it has not reached the level of that of Syria or Gaza, should be a wake-up call for the Council and for all stakeholders to redouble their efforts and take meaningful action towards a sustainable solution to the crisis.
It is true that the volatility of the situation on the ground continues to hinder political and diplomatic efforts to find a sustainable solution to the Ukrainian crisis. We thank the Secretary-General for his good offices and continued efforts for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. In that respect, we reiterate our support for President Poroshenko’s peace plan, which should be the basis for a long-term solution to the crisis. We also appreciate the initiatives of the trilateral contact group of senior representatives of Ukraine, the Russian Federation and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as the commitments contained in the joint Berlin declaration of 2 July of the ministers for foreign affairs of Germany, France, the Russian Federation and Ukraine.
Let me reiterate our call for the respect of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. In that regard, we urge all armed groups in eastern Ukraine to disarm and adhere to a ceasefire in order to de-escalate the situation. We believe that the Government of Ukraine has a right to restore public order on its territory, provided that right is exercised in a proportional manner with a view to preserving the chance for a genuine and inclusive dialogue among all Ukrainians.
In conclusion, Rwanda notes that today the Security Council is considering the humanitarian situation in the Ukraine and that in two days it will hold another meeting focused on the human rights situation in the country. We believe that such a piecemeal approach of considering different aspects of a particular crisis is not helpful, as all of them are interconnected. Consequently, Rwanda suggests holding a monthly meeting on the situation in Ukraine. That would enable us to remain seized of this matter and to consider the Ukrainian crisis in all its aspects. ","I would like to thank Mr. John Ging, Director of the Coordination and Response Division of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, for his briefing on the worrying humanitarain situation in southern and eastern Ukraine.
Argentina once again expresses its deep concern about the situation in southern and eastern Ukraine and its increasing deterioration. The fears that we have already expressed about the impact of the re-escalation in violence on the civilian population unfortunately seem to be justified, with the threat that the humanitarian crisis will become increasingly severe. We are concerned about the growing number of displaced persons as as result of the violent clashes in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. There is no need to reiterate the information provided to us by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Rather, we must understand that the international community cannot remain indifferent towards the number of people in Ukraine, most of whom are women and children, seeking refuge in Russia.
The reports of the increasing number of civilians who have lost their lives as a result of artillery fire in areas controlled by armed groups are alarming. In addition, the attacks by armed groups on water facilities, power plants and other key infrastructure — it has been said, and we agree — subject the population to an extremely vulnerable situation, which increases the threats directly generated by the violence. We find ourselves in a situation where it is difficult to access health services, sanitation is worsening and there could be outbreaks of infectious or non-infectious diseases associated with those difficulties and the lack of access to health services.
We launch an urgent appeal for strict respect of obligations with regard to the protection of civilians in the areas affected by the violence. We must also ensure that there are the conditions for civilians to leave the areas affected by the clashes between the Ukrainian forces and the armed groups, in particular in the Donetsk region. All measures must be taken so that the urgent needs of the displaced can be addressed. We must underscore that if the hostilities continue, the low temperatures that will come with the arrival of winter will put the displaced persons, in particular women and children, in an even more fragile situation.
We would also like to acknowledge the work done by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in coordination with other United Nations agencies, particularly in developing the basis for a future humanitarian response in Ukraine. There can be no question that we support the call to the international community to lend all its support to the efforts under way to help the displaced and provide the necessary assistance.
Lastly, we believe it is vital to emphasize the importance of ensuring that an investigation be made of all the incidents in which civilians have lost their lives or been injured, because we must determine who is responsible and guarantee accountability, a condition that Argentina believes is necessary if security, peace and the required social dialogue that Ukraine needs are to be achieved. We therefore emphasize the urgent need for an inclusive and constructive political dialogue, which is the only way this crisis can be resolved. ","I would also like to thank the Director of the Coordination and Response Division of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for his briefing.
Luxembourg shares OCHA’s concern about the deterioration of the humanitarian situation and the increase in violence in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk controlled by separatists. While illegal armed groups and their outside support continue to destabilize the country and undermine its territorial sovereignty and integrity, the first victims are, once again, civilians. The numbers that Mr. Ging just mentioned speak for themselves. We are also deeply concerned about the number of cases of intimidation, torture, abduction and murder that have been reported for a little more than the past four months in areas controlled by the separatists. Such human-rights violations must stop, and international humanitarian law must be respected.
Given the situation, we must intensify our efforts to help the population affected, in particular the 110,000 people who have been displaced. We call on the Ukrainian Government to continue and to step up its efforts in this area, in close cooperation and coordination with the United Nations and international humanitarian agencies. We believe that establishing a centralized registry, as promised by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, is essential. We would also encourage humanitarian actors to cooperate closely with other international players present in Ukraine, including the human rights observation mission of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the special observation mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which has been deployed in Ukraine since March.
But beyond such humanitarian work, we must above all step up our efforts to create the conditions for realizing President Poroshenko’s peace plan and to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in Ukraine. The talks that have begun under the auspices of the Chairperson-in-Office of the OSCE are crucial in that regard, as is the deployment of civilian monitors to the two border checkpoints of Donetsk and Gukovo on the Russian-Ukrainian border, decided by the OSCE Permanent Council on 24 July. It is crucial that the borders be made secure and that the separatist armed groups do not continue to receive equipment. In order to support and enhance the efforts under way, it is also important that the Secretary-General continue to use his good offices.
On 18 July, we condemned the tragic deaths of the 298 passengers on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (see S/PV.7219), brought down from the skies above Ukraine. We hoped then that 17 July would not simply remain in our memories as the day of that tragedy, but would also be remembered as a day that was a turning point in the search for a solution to the crisis in Ukraine. The time has come to honour the memory of the victims of the Ukrainian crisis and finally make a commitment in good faith to seeking a peaceful solution. ","I would like to thank Mr. John Ging for his briefing today.
The Republic of Korea remains deeply concerned about the continuing escalation of tensions in eastern Ukraine. Despite the ongoing diplomatic efforts of the international community, the situation on the ground shows no sign of abating. The continung violence has led to a growing loss of life and a further deterioration in the humanitarian situation. We are especially concerned about the report that the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ukraine has reached 117,000, having risen sharply since June. At the same time, the lack of adequate shelter and basic services, such as water and electricity for the IDPs, also remains a major source of concern. Given the gravity of the situation, further and broader humanitarian measures, such as more humanitarian corridors, are urgently needed.
The volatile situation in eastern Ukraine clearly demonstrates that a solution to the ongoing crisis can be found only through an immediate cessation of hostilities and through meaningful dialogue among all the parties concerned. In that regard, we welcome the recent meeting of the trilateral contact group held in Minsk on 31 July with representatives of separatist groups from eastern Ukraine. We call on all parties to engage in constructive dialogue so that they can agree on an immediate ceasefire on the basis of the Berlin declaration of 2 July. In that connection, all illegal armed groups must halt all violence and lay down their arms. That is the key for any sustainable solution to the crisis.
Finally, turning to the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, we reiterate our support for a full, thorough and independent international investigation. All the parties concerned must comply with their obligations under resolution 2166 (2014) and fully cooperate with the international investigation. "
S/PV.7221,21/07/2014,Follow-up on the downing of the MH-17 Flight,"China voted in favour of resolution 2166 (2014), which the Council just adopted. China deplores the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in eastern Ukraine, which resulted in the loss of the 298 lives aboard. In his recent statement while visiting Latin American countries, Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed shock at the crash, mourned the death of all the victims and expressed condolences to the bereaved families. He also stressed that an impartial and objective investigation into this incident be undertaken so as to establish the truth as soon as possible. China supports an independent, impartial and objective investigation into this incident. As a specialized agency of the United Nations dealing with international civil aviation affairs, the International Civil Aviation Organization should play a crucial role in an international investigation. China calls on all the parties to collaborate and cooperate with the international investigation. China believes that our current focus should be on establishing the truth of the crash. Pending that, all sides should not jump to conclusions or engage in conjecture or mutual recrimination. We believe that the unanimous action by the Council today will help to enhance mutual trust and cooperation among all sides and to facilitate swift progress in the investigation.","The emotion that was upon us on Friday has not left us, but today we have gathered to act. Resolution 2166 (2014), which we have just adopted at the initiative of Australia, underscores the importance of quickly conducting an investigation into the circumstances of this abominable tragedy. We owe it to the families of those who have perished, as the presence of many nationalities represented here today shows. Once again, we want to express our profound condolences and our complete solidarity in this ordeal. In that regard, we welcome the presence among us of the Ministers from Australia, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. In adopting this resolution, the international community has taken a first step towards shedding light on this tragedy, establishing responsibilities and meeting the demands of justice. Resolution 2166 (2014) bolsters the existing framework that should apply in this matter. In keeping with the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, it is up to Ukraine, with the assistance of all those impacted by the disaster, especially experts from the International Civil Aviation Organization, to lead the work of the international investigation. The resolution also demands that everything be done to facilitate the rapid work of the investigators. Henceforth, all parties and States in the region must guarantee immediate and unfettered access to the site of the disaster, to the remains of the victims and to material elements necessary for the investigation. We would like to express our grave alarm about the fact that reports available to us continue to indicate repeated obstruction by the separatists. We demand that the disaster site no longer be profaned, that it not be altered and that it not be manipulated. The revolting, shameful and, ultimately, inhuman actions must stop. The resolution asks the Secretary-General to present options to the Security Council in order to provide support to the investigation and give an account of its developments. The resolution also recalls that those responsible for the disaster will have to answer for their heinous acts. The investigation that we support today through resolution 2166 (2014) must be pursued to its end. France will ensure that this happens. We will never forget the 298 innocent victims struck down in the Ukrainian skies","On behalf of the Russian Federation, allow me once again to convey our condolences to the families of all of those who lost their lives and to the Governments of those countries whose nationals were aboard the plane that went down in Ukraine on 17 July. There is the need for a full, impartial, independent and open international investigation into the Malaysia Airlines disaster. That is the aim of resolution 2166 (2014), which was prepared with our active participation and which we support. Clarifying the context of this event should take place with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in a leading role, as well as with the participation of all who stand ready to shed light on the truth. All evidence, including the black boxes, should be provided to ICAO to examine under the framework of an international investigation. Conditions must be created on the ground to facilitate access for international teams of experts. Every possible effort must be made to focus on guaranteeing full security for international experts at the crash site and on providing them with, as it were, humanitarian corridors. Representatives from Donbass, Donetsk, the Ukrainian Ministry of Emergencies and experts from interested countries are already present on the ground. But that is not enough. A full team of experts must be at the crash site, under ICAO and a relevant international commission. For its part, Russia stands ready to provide all the assistance necessary to organize and conduct impartial international investigations. In that context, Russian military personnel and civilian bodies have already received the necessary instructions. We are ready to provide experts to participate and carry out investigations. However, it is not the time for snap conclusions or political statements. What is happening today is absolutely inadmissible. It seems that Kyiv is attempting to draw on the shock of the international community in the light of the downing of Flight MH-17 in order to step up its punitive operations in the eastern part of the country. Indiscriminate artillery and air strikes are targeting cities and killing civilians. We would like to ask those Council members that affirmed in this Chamber that Kyiv would act with “restraint” to explain the strange meaning they assign to that word. We understand how the people who lost family and friends feel. Russia found itself in a similar tragic situation in October 2001 when, in the skies over the Black Sea, an anti-aircraft missile downed a Russian passenger flight flying from Tel Aviv to Novosibirsk. Seventy-eight people aboard were killed. The circumstances became clear immediately after the accident and were confirmed by independent international experts. However, to this day Ukraine rejects its legal responsibility in that regard. Given that record, it would be quite reckless to give Kyiv a leading role in conducting an international investigation into the 17 July incident. In the course of the investigation, Ukraine will have to answer several questions with regard to the activities of its air traffic controllers and the reason that a Ukrainian Buk missile system was in the area directly controlled by rebels. Why was it that, immediately following the downing of the flight, that missile battery was hastily removed from the area? Why was Ukrainian anti-aircraft radar working at maximum capacity on 17 July? Those are some of the questions raised by Russia’s Ministry of Defence, about which international investigators will have to be informed. Up to now, Kyiv has provided doctored evidence to the Security Council — for example, the controversial recordings of the radio communications involving rebel commanders, which seem to have been altered to refer to negotiations that took place before 17 July. Ukraine’s Minister for Internal Affairs put forward a video that somehow showed a surface-to-air Buk system on Russian territory, but which was in fact filmed on Ukranian territory and thus could not have been under rebel control. Let us not forget that an armed clash in the area of the crash site was the reason for the 17 July incident. Today’s priority is to put a swift end to clashes and violence and to establish peaceful negotiations on the basis of the 17 April Geneva declaration and the 2 July Berlin statement. We continue to fully participate in that effort. I was going to conclude there, but I have an additional comment to make. I had thought that today’s meeting would not have been controversial. However, the representative of the United States opted for a literary track. Perhaps Washington does not know about the efforts that Russia has made in the context of the contact group, among others, to ensure that international experts can go to the area of the crash as soon as possible. If that is so, then the American Embassy should be better informed. Indeed, there is no need to turn the discussion of this tragedy into a farce.","The United Kingdom welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2166 (2014). I would like to warmly thank Australia for its leadership in steering the resolution to adoption. I would also like to acknowledge the presence here today of the Foreign Ministers of Australia, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Allow me to take this opportunity to reiterate our deepest and most heartfelt condolences to the citizens and Governments of all those countries that lost nationals in the tragedy and are now in mourning. In the United Kingdom, we, too, are in mourning for the 10 Britons who were killed. We have all seen the images of the blackened earth and the twisted metal. We have all seen those countless wooden stakes, each tied with a piece of white cloth fluttering in the cornfields of eastern Ukraine, marking the place of a family member or loved one. We owe it to the memory of those 298 victims to ensure that their remains are treated with dignity and respect. We owe it to them to find out exactly what happened on the afternoon of 17 July. That is the purpose of resolution 2166 (2014). It is a united demand by the whole international community for the dignified, respectful and professional treatment and recovery of the bodies of the victims. What we have witessed over the past days has been sickening and appalling beyond belief. We have seen separatist thugs trampling over the site of the crash, showing no respect for the bodies of the victims, rifling through their belongings and even looting their personal effects. They have shown complete disregard for human dignity and have violated the established procedures for dealing with an incident of that nature. First, the resolution requires the pro-Russian separatists in control of the crash site and the surrounding area to allow the bodies of the victims to be returned to their families as soon as possible. It is inexcusable that that process has been obstructed for the past four days. Secondly, the resolution is about the investigation into what happened. It supports a full, thorough and independent international investigation and recognizes the steps already taken by the Ukrainian authorities and other international stakeholders, notably the International Civil Aviation Organization, to set that in motion. It demands that the separatists do not further compromise the integrity of the crash site. We have all seen the images of cranes and other heavy machinery disturbing the wreckage, and the footage released yesterday that appears to show one of the flight recorders being removed from the site. That is completely unacceptable. The site must be preserved and investigators must immeditely be granted safe, secure, full and unrestricted access. Finally, the Council is sending a strong message with regard to accountability. Those who were responsible and those who were complicit in the shooting down of Flight MH-17 must be held accountable for their actions. The resolution demands that all States cooperate fully with those efforts. The context of the tragedy is Russia’s attempt to destabilize a sovereign State and to violate its territorial integrity. The events of the past four days should serve as a wake-up call in Moscow and prompt a profound re-examination of Russia’s policy of supporting, training and arming violent separatists in eastern Ukraine.","Today’s resolution 2166 (2014) calls for a full, through and independent investigation into the horrific downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. When 298 civilians are killed, we agree that we must stop at nothing to determine who is responsible and to bring them to justice. As we take that step, we are joined by the Dutch and Australian Ministers whose countries suffered an immense and heart-wrenching loss on Thursday, one that they are still grappling with, together with nine other countries from where the victims came. We extend our deepest condolences to those countries, the families of the victims they represent and all of the people who lost loved ones on that plane. Their presence here today, along with representatives of the dozens of other countries struck by this heinous crime, gives even greater urgency to our calls for the dignified return of the victims and to our pursuit of truth and justice. As we reflect on the immeasurable loss suffered by those families around the world, we are not only outraged at the attack itself, we are horrified and enraged by what has happened since — by the clear intention of some to obstruct an investigation into how the passengers and crew died. Even after adopting today’s resolution, it is worth asking if there really is consensus that the crime merits an immediate and impartial investigation. Why did we still feel the need to meet today in order to demand one? We came together because not everyone has been supporting a real investigation into the crime. If they were, international experts would have had unimpeded access to the crime scene and all of the wreckage would have been left where it had fallen. That has not happened. Instead, armed thugs have walked around the site with little regard for where they step. We have literally heard the sound of debris, all of it evidence that needs to be carefully preserved, crunching beneath their feet. We have seen separatists moving human remains around and carting away evidence from the site. All around the world this weekend, people of all cultures and faiths had similar reactions to seeing the footage of the separatists damaging the site. “Stop, those are people! Those are peoples’ lives!”, we all said. The passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 had nothing to do with the conflict in eastern Ukraine. They were families heading out on vacation, students returning home from abroad, researchers trying to eradicate a deadly disease. Those who were killed deserve to be treated with dignity. Their families are crying out, as we have heard, for closure. We condemn the actions of the separatists who control the site. Indeed, almost everyone has condemned that grotesque behaviour. But there is one party from which we have heard too little condemnation, and that is Russia. Russia has been outspoken on other matters. Russian officials have publicly insinuated that Ukraine was behind the crash. On Friday, Russia blamed Ukrainian air traffic controllers for the attack, rather than condemning the criminals who shot down the plane. Since then, Russia has begun to blame Ukraine for the attack itself, although the missile came from separatist territory that Russia knows full well Ukraine has not yet reclaimed. But if Russia genuinely believed that Ukraine was involved in the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, surely President Putin would have told the separatists, many of whose leaders are from Russia, to guard the evidence at all costs and to maintain a forensically pure hermetically sealed crime scene. We welcome Russia’s support for today’s resolution. But no resolution would have been necessary had Russia used its leverage with the separatists on Thursday and gotten them to lay down their arms and leave the site to international experts — or on Friday, or on Saturday, or even yesterday. It turns out that only this morning, coincidentally the very morning Security Council was meeting to discuss the investigation, did President Putin finally issue a public call to ensure the security of international experts. However — and this is critically important — President Putin still did not direct his call to the separatists, who have threatened those experts and over whom he has enormous influence. President Poroshenko, by contrast, has consistently done everything within his power since the crash to allow capable investigators full and unfettered access to the crime scene. He has been willing to involve the International Civil Aviation Organization, the Netherlands and other international players, and has hailed their independence. Russia’s muteness over the dark days between Thursday and today sent a message to the illegal armed groups it supports: “We have your backs”. That is the message Russia has sent by providing separatists with heavy weapons, by never publicly calling on them to lay down those weapons and by massing thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border. Today we have taken a step towards combating impunity. The resolution we have adopted provides clear directions to safeguard and uncover the facts, however inconvenient those facts may prove to be. We have adopted a resolution today, but we are not naive. If Russia is not part of the solution, it will continue to be part of the problem. For the past six months, Russia has seized Ukrainian territory and ignored the repeated requests of the international community to de-escalate, all in an effort to preserve influence in Ukraine, a country that has long made clear its desire to maintain constructive ties with Moscow. Russia must recognize that no move on the geopolitical chessboard and no zero-sum game with the West can offset the pain being felt by the passengers’ families worldwide, or the pain that Ukrainians are experiencing daily as a result of this needless conflict. As we meet, we are seeing initial signs of the separatists’ allowing greater access to crash site. Today, three Dutch investigators accessed the site. The separatists are attempting to hold that up as proof of their openness and good faith. But let us be clear: this is an extremely complex and time-sensitive crime scene. In that context, a spigot approach, letting in a few investigators here and a few more there, simply will not cut it. Access must be immediate and it must be full, period. A spigot, or a stage-managed, approach is a form of obstruction. Russia can help change that. Russia can unequivocally condemn the separatists’ inhumane treatment of the bodies at the site and use its influence to ensure they stop tampering with evidence. Russia can demand that the separatists immediately adopt a ceasefire in the area around the crash site, as Ukraine has done. Russia can press the illegal groups to sit down with President Poroshenko, who has proposed a serious and reasonable peace plan. Instead of continuing to provide weapons to the separatists, Russia could take back all of the surface-to-air missiles, tanks and other heavy weaponry that it has delivered to them. Those would not only be important steps towards achieving accountability and achieving justice for the victims, they would constitute a long overdue sign that Russia is willing to take steps to end this deadly crisis.",,,,,,,,,,,"I thank the Council for having convened this meeting. I would like to reiterate our deeepest condolences to the families and friends of those who were killed. Today, all of Ukraine is mourning. Ukraine is approaching the embassies of the Netherlands, Malaysia. Australia, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, the Philippines and Canada in order to lay flowers and to express its sorrow.
We would like to thank the delegation of Australia for having proposed resolution 2166 (2014) on the investigation of the downing of the civilian aircraft on an international flight, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, which the delegation of Ukraine co-sponsored. We believe that the resolution will help to facilitate a full, thorough and independent international investigation into the incident in accordance with international civil aviation guidelines.
Having shown our utmost openness, the same day, immediately following the crash, Ukraine invited the International Civil Aviation Organization, INTERPOL and representatives of all countries that lost their nationals in the tragedy, as well as the Russian Federation, to participate in the investigation. Some of them have already arrived in Ukraine and started their work in Kharkiv.
President Poroshenko gave the order that all military activities immediately cease in the 40 kilometre zone surrounding the crash site to allow for the security and safety of the international investigation. We therefore call on the Russian Federation to use all its influence on the pro-Russian armed groups operating illegally in the Donetsk region in order to stop military activities on their side and ensure secure access to the crash site. We assume that the investigation should be allowed to establish not only the technical cause of the crash but also the other important circumstances, namely, who had actually fired the missile and how the high-precision long-range weapons got into the hands of illegal armed groups. Where did the weapons come from?
In accordance with the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, as was mentioned in the statement by the representative of France, Ukraine has a right to head the investigation procedure. It is also our right to share that leadership. The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Mr. Arseniy Yatsenyuk, stated today in an address that Ukraine is ready to transfer the role of coordinator in investigating the crash of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, at that country’s request. In his remarks, Prime Minister Yatsenyuk said,
“as the side that suffered the most, the Netherlands may lead the investigation in close coordination and cooperation with all other parties. All Ukrainian law enforcement bodies and international partners are already involved in conducting an all-encompassing, transparent and full-fledged international investigation of the tragedy”.
We particularly strongly condemn the morally repulsive acts committed by illegal armed groups controlling the crash site. According to the reports of local citizens of Alchevsk, in the Luhansk region, valuables belonging to the victims of the plane crash were brought by terrorists in a previously stolen ambulance to the city, where they boasted about their trophies — children’s bags, suitcases and foreign currency that they managed to collect and steal from the crash site. That demonstrates the lack of humanity of those who call themselves “the People’s Republic”. The fact that during the last three days the illegal armed groups were impeding the appropriate investigating authorities, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and others from gaining safe, secure and unrestricted access to the crash site and the surrounding area is proof that they are trying to hide evidence from the international community.
Let me quote the President of Ukraine:
“Having shot down the aircraft, militants committed three crimes — the terrorist act of firing a missile at a civilian aircraft; offensive mistreatment of dead bodies, particularly their removal; and the destruction of evidence and the hindering of the work not only of the Ukrainian Commission of Inquiry but also of the international experts of the International Civil Aviation Organization Commission”.The so-called Luhansk and Donetsk Republics must be recognized as terrorist organizations, not only in Ukraine, but throughout the world. Cooperation with them must be considered a support for terrorism.
The persistence of illegal terrorist military activity has been possible only with the Russian Federation’s direct and overt support, despite continued calls by Ukraine and the international community to stop. Although officials in Moscow have constantly and tirelessly insisted that they were not involved in the situation in Donbass region, the irrefutable facts clearly indicate the opposite.
Russian citizens are members of the leadership of the terrorist groups. Heavy armaments and ammunition continues to be supplied from the Russian side of the State border. Just yesterday, a column of heavy armoured battle vehicles attempted to break into Ukraine through the border with the Russian territory at border checkpoint Izvarino. Russia is financing the terrorists. Numerous provocations are happening on the Russian-Ukrainian border.
What Russia is declaring thus does not square with its actions. Ukraine demands that the Russian side immediately cease provocations on the State border with Ukraine, stop hindering efforts of the Ukrainian side and the international community to put an end to terrorism and other violence in Donetsk and Luhansk, which are Oblasts of Ukraine, return to President Poroshenko’s peace plan, withdraw its forces from the Ukrainian border and stop threatening peace and security in our country, the region and the world as whole.","Let me first of all express my sincere condolences and heartfelt sympathies to Foreign Minister Timmermans and the people of the Netherlands, to Foreign Minister Bishop and the people of Australia, and to all others who had nationals, relatives, family or friends on Flight MH-17. Two hundred and ninety-eight lives have been tragically lost. We are mourning the loss of four of our citizens. My Government is profoundly grateful for the condolences offered by so many delegations during the past few days.
Germany is shocked over increasing evidence that the airliner was, indeed, shot down. This would be an outrageous crime. What is happening currently at the crash site is unacceptable and shameful. The world is horrified to witness the abominable circumstances prevailing there.
We welcome the adoption of resolution 2166 (2014) and we call on all actors to ensure that unhindered access and security for Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe monitors and international experts are guaranteed; that there are no further impediments to the recovery of the bodies of victims and their transport to Kharkiv, as proposed by the Netherlands; that any further tampering with possible evidence is ruled out; and that an international investigation is started as soon as possible, leading to a full and thorough examination. We welcome the efforts undertaken by the Government of Ukraine to this effect so far. We also applaud President Poroshenko’s announcement today of a unilateral ceasefire around the crash site — a step that must be reciprocated immediately by the separatists.
The downing of MH-17 has added a global dimension to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. It renders a peaceful and negotiated resolution of the crisis even more urgent. The conflict in eastern Ukraine must be brought to an end. We urgently need a bilateral ceasefire and the beginning of real negotiations. Germany has constantly worked to further such a peaceful solution, as demonstrated by innumerable talks and meetings between Chancellor Merkel, Foreign Minister Steinmeier and other senior leaders.
Unfortunately, the Russian leadership has so far failed to discourage the separatists from their illegal acts and to stop the infiltration of weapons, fighters and ammunition. We expect Russia to finally bring its influence to bear on the separatists, to prevent Russian citizens from joining them, and to immediately take all necessary measures to ensure effective control of the Russian-Ukrainian border. We also expect Russia to fully support the investigation concerning the causes of the crash, particularly by exerting the necessary pressure on the separatists to immediately stop destroying evidence and to give full and unfettered access to Ukrainian and international investigators. ",,,"The tragedy of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 has left us all shocked and in deep sadness. We are all in mourning. However, the grief is even greater for the families and friends who are dealing with the loss of their loved ones. As the struggle to understand the loss of so many innocent lives in the crash of Flight MH-17 continues, witnessing the current situation, especially for the families of the victims, is deeply painful. We share their pain and their sorrow.
Since the incident, we have seen various initiatives and efforts undertaken by many countries to investigate the incident, which we greatly welcome. Indonesia wishes to emphasize that, even when it comes to humanitarian tragedies, all parties must cooperate. In that regard, they should collaborate and assist the peoples and Governments of the victims’ countries of origin. We therefore welcome the adoption of resolution 2166 (2014), which Indonesia co-sponsored, on this particular issue. In that regard, we also commend Australia for taking the initiative.
Our delegation is pleased that the Council, through the resolution, demands full and unrestricted access to the crash site and surrounding area for the appropriate parties and supports a full, thorough and independent international investigation into the incident. For Indonesia, as well as the rest of the international community, it is also important for the evacuation of the victims’ bodies to be treated in a dignified, respectful and professional manner and to ensure that the process begins immediately. We also underscore that the victims’ bodies must be returned home without any further delay.
Indonesia reiterates its strong support and assistance for the investigation process, including by joining the mission to help identify the victims of Flight MH-17. As the tragic and wanton loss of life is felt around the world, we also demand that those responsible for that inhuman incident be held accountable for their heinous crime. We are aware that such a process will not bring back the daughters, sons, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers or friends of the families who are struggling to cope with their immeasurable loss. However, justice must be served and we urge all concerned countries and entities to fully play their role to ensure that that, along with the other requirements stated in the resolution, happens.",,"Mr. President, I thank you for giving me the floor and for allowing me to explain the position of the Belgian Government with regard to resolution 2166 (20140, which was adopted today and which Belgium decided to co-sponsor. Last Friday, before the Security Council, Belgium supported the Australian proposal for a Security Council resolution. We are grateful to Australia for preparing the text that was adopted today and would like to thank all countries that expressed support for it.
Belgium has condemned in the strongest terms the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. Belgium reiterates its call of last Friday for an immediate, full, thorough and independent international investigation, led by Ukraine in close cooperation with the International Civil Aviation Organization. Despite some recent positive developments, Belgium remains very concerned about the continued lack of full access to the crash site. Belgium is deeply disturbed about the reports of representatives of armed groups meddling with wreckage, equipment, debris, personal belongings and remains. Our first priority now must be the identification and repatriation of the bodies of the victims. We demand that this be done in a dignified, respectful and professional manner. Belgium stands ready to support all efforts in that regard.
We call on all parties, especially those in the region, to use their influence on the actors on the ground to allow for immediate access and the start of the international investigation. The adoption by consensus of resolution 2166 (2014) today should contribute to that. We also call for international and regional cooperation and commend, in particular, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe for the constructive role it has played so far.
Today is Belgian National Day, but our nation is still in mourning for the six Belgians who lost their lives in this terrible incident and for all the victims, wherever it was they called home. Our special thoughts and sympathy go to the families and friends of the 193 victims of the Netherlands, a country that is particularly close and dear to us. ",,,,"I wish to acknowledge the participation of the Foreign Ministers of Australia, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
I would now like to make a statement in my national capacity that reflects the viewpoint of the Foreign Ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as stated on 19 July.
“ASEAN member States strongly condemn the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in eastern Ukraine on 17 July 2014. We express shock at the tragic deaths of the 298 people of multiple nationalities on board the airline.“Flight MH-17 was flying over non-restricted airspace, and following a flight path which had been declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). It is a flight route that is utilized by many international airlines plying the Asia-Europe route.“ASEAN member States underline that it is imperative that we find out precisely what happened to Flight MH-17. We call for a full, independent and transparent investigation into the catastrophe. We emphasize that investigations must not be hindered.“ASEAN member States hereby convey our profound sorrow and condolences to the families and loved ones of those on board Flight MH-17.”",,,,,,,,,"I wish to thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me to speak here today.
We are here to discuss a tragedy: the downing of a commercial airliner and the death of 298 innocent people. Men, women and a staggering number of children lost their lives on their way to their holiday destinations, homes, loved ones or international obligations such as the important HIV/AIDS conference in Australia. Since Thursday, I have been thinking how horrible must have been the final moments of their lives, when they knew the plane was going down. Did they lock hands with their loved ones, did they hold their children close to their hearts, did they look each other in the eyes, one final time, in a wordless goodbye? We will never know. The demise of almost 200 of my compatriots has left a hole in the heart of the Dutch nation, and it has caused grief, anger and despair — grief at the loss of loved ones, anger at the outrage of the downing of a civilian airplane, and despair after witnessing the excruciatingly slow process of securing the crash site and recovering the remains of the victims.
It is fitting that the Council should take a position on this matter, and I welcome the adoption of today’s resolution 2166 (2014), which was submitted by Australia and which the Netherlands co-sponsored. I thank the countries that expressed support for it, and I particularly want to thank Julie Bishop personally. Julie, we are in this together.
For the Netherlands, one priority clearly stands out above all others: bring the victims’ remains home. It is a matter of human decency that remains should be treated with respect and that recovering victims’ remains should be done without any delay.
In the last couple of days, we have received very disturbing reports of bodies being moved about and looted for their possessions. Just for one minute — and here I address you not as representatives of your countries but as husbands and wives, fathers and mothers — just imagine that you first get the news that your husband was killed, and then within two or three days you see images of some thug removing the wedding band from his hand. Just imagine that this could be your spouse. To my dying day I will not be able to understand how it could have taken so much time for the rescue workers to be allowed to do their difficult jobs and how human remains could have been used in a political game. If someone here around the table talks about a political game, this is a political game that has been played with human remains, and it is despicable. I hope that the world will not have to witness this again any time in future.
Images of children’s toys being tossed around, luggage being opened and passports — including children’s passports — being shown on television are turning the grief and mourning of a whole nation into anger. We demand unimpeded access to the terrain. We demand respectful treatment of the crash site. We demand dignity for the victims and the multitudes who mourn their loss.
I call on the international community, on the Security Council, on anyone with influence on the situation on the ground: allow us to bring the victims’ remains home to their loved ones without any further delay. They deserve to be home.
As we are currently taking the lead in the forensic examination of the human remains, I pledge that the Netherlands will do its utmost to make sure that all remains will be identified and returned home, wherever that home may be. We will work intensively with all countries and international organizations involved to make this happen as soon as possible.
I also welcome the setting up of a proper investigation into the cause of the tragedy of MH-17, as envisaged in today’s resolution. The Netherlands has agreed to assume a leading role in such an investigation, in close cooperation with the relevant countries, the United Nations and the International Civil Aviation Organization. I am fully aware of the great responsibility we now take upon ourselves, and I give my personal commitment that we will discharge this responsibility to the best of our abilities.
As far as the safety and security of the site and the international investigators is concerned, I underline the responsibility that the Security Council took upon itself with today’s resolution to take additional measures if circumstances so require.
Once the investigation ascertains who was responsible for the downing of Flight MH-17, accountability and justice must be pursued and delivered. We owe it to the victims; we owe it to justice; we owe it to humanity. Please, provide full cooperation so that justice can be served. We will not rest until all facts are known and justice has been served. ",,,,,,,,"New Zealand welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2166 (2014) by the Security Council. We were pleased to have been a sponsor and compliment Australia on the leadership it has shown on the issue. It was imperative that the Council send a strong and united message that the international investigation into the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 must proceed without delay, that the integrity of the crash site be preserved and that respect and dignity be accorded to those who have died. It is, as Foreign Minister Bishop has said, a decisive step.
New Zealand strongly supports the resolution’s call for an independent investigation led by Ukraine in close coordination with International Civil Aviation Organization experts and other international experts, not least the Netherlands in the role that was outlined for us a short time ago by Foreign Minister Timmermans. We now appear to be in a situation where some of that cooperation is now at hand. But we must still wait to see the extent to which it eventuates.
There is increasing evidence that the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 was not an accident, that it was a criminal act, punishable under national and international law, and those responsible must be brought to account. We specifically call on all countries involved to act in accordance with their international legal obligations. That means that the crash site is a crime scene, but reports indicate that access has been denied by local separatists and that they have removed evidence, including the black boxes that are so critical to air accident investigations. Now it appears that they have been handed over, but they should never have been touched by unauthorized personnel. Even worse has been the removal of the bodies of victims.
We call on those people to cooperate with international authorities immediately and unreservedly, particularly to allow a full, safe and unfettered corridor of access to the site. We also call on Russia to use its influence with those groups to ensure that progress is made, and that it is made immediately. The integrity of the crash site must be preserved, and bodies must be accorded proper respect, as must personal effects, including passports. Those who loot bodies or who play with the toys that have fallen from the hands of children are beneath contempt. The victims are not being treated with appropriate dignity. Such callousness is insulting to the victims and brings further and unnecessary suffering to grieving families. It is utterly unacceptable. Reports that bodies are now being removed to Amsterdam are welcome, but that is the dignified treatment they merited days ago, not just now.
Resolution 2166 (2014) demonstrates the international community’s resolve that things need to move and they need to move now. The relevant authorities must be allowed to go about their appointed tasks unfettered and without any interference. This Security Council must pay close and continuing attention to the crisis, and it must ensure that progress is swiftly made, that human dignity is respected and that the perpetrators of this violent criminal act are brought to justice. ","I wish to acknowledge the presence of the Foreign Minsiters of Australia, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
I wish to thank you, Mr. President, for giving my delegation the opportunity to address the Council at this point in time. I also wish to thank all Council members, in particular the delegation of Australia, for their efforts in coordinating and presenting resolution 2166 (2014). We welcome its unanimous adoption by the Security Council today.
As one of the countries most severely affected by the tragedy of Flight MH-17, Malaysia attaches great importance to the resolution. For my delegation, the resolution lays the groundwork for the approach to be taken by the international community, in particular the United Nations system and its mechanisms, towards addressing the many questions raised by the downing of Flight MH-17. I wish to underscore that no number of measures will ever compensate or assuage the grief and suffering of the families and loved ones of the victims who were on board Flight MH-17. It is incumbent upon us, as members of the United Nations family, to honour the victims by undertaking a full, thorough and independent investigation into the downing of Flight MH-17.
Last Friday, during the Council’s emergency meeting on Ukraine (see S/PV.7219), I informed the Council that Malaysia would immediately dispatch a team to Kyiv with a view to assisting in the investigation of Flight MH-17. That team arrived in Kyiv on Saturday, 19 July. The Malaysian team in Kyiv has joined other national teams from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States in what is known as the joint international investigation team.
Malaysia regrets to note that, as of today, the joint international investigation team has yet to be given full access to the crash site. Malaysia finds that lack of full access unacceptable and reiterates its call on all States and actors in the region to cooperate fully in the conduct of the international investigation, including by being given immediate and unrestricted access to the crash site. It also calls for full guarantees to be provided for the safety and security of the investigation teams.
At the same time, all parties must exert all efforts to preserve the integrity of the crash site with a view to facilitating the work of the investigation teams. Such guarantees must also extend to the dignified and respectful treatment of the bodies and remains of the victims. For Malaysia, one of the key mission priorities of our investigation team is the recovery, identification and repatriation of the bodies and remains of the victims. That is to ensure that their families and loved ones can have closure and that the victims are accorded the dignity of a proper burial.
Flight MH-I7 was a civilian airliner. If it is subsequently established that the plane was indeed shot down, we demand that those responsible for downing the plane be held to account and be swiftly brought to justice. We believe that the current resolution paves the way for such efforts and, as such, we firmly supported it by co-sponsoring resolution 2166 (2014). We now look forward to its full implementation by all concerned parties. ",,,"The international community has been in painful shock since the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 in the Donetsk oblast of Ukraine on Thursday. Having heard the statements today, I believe all of us are still in a state of disbelief.
Ukrainian and international investigators and observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) have been impeded by illegal armed groups from securing, investigating and collecting evidence at the crash site. Black boxes apparently remain in the hands of armed terrorists. Inexplicably, tampering with evidence has been taking place. Only today, after sustained pressure on the Russian authorities, were OSCE observers allowed access to the site.
By depriving 298 loved ones, including 80 children, of the right to live, this tragedy has touched us all. The Government of Lithuania extends its deepest sympathy and condolences and shares the grief of all those families in this time of bereavement.
The remains of the victims must be treated with dignity and be returned to the families as soon as possible.
In the face of this unjustifiable incident, we look forward to a thorough and independent international investigation in accordance with international civil aviation guidelines. The perpetrators of this despicable crime must be brought to justice. Impunity will not go unpunished.
We welcome the unanimous adoption of resolution 2166 (2014) today. Thirteen Council members, including Lithuania, sponsored the resolution. The resolution requests the Secretary-General to report to the Council on the relevant developments and to identify options for providing United Nations support to the investigation. We ask the Secretary-General to do that as soon as possible.
We commend Ukraine for its enormous efforts to convene an objective, transparent and full investigation. We commend the announcement by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko of an immediate ceasefire within a 40-kilometre radius around the crash site. Do we expect a similar announcement from illegally armed groups and their backers?
The responsibility for the downing of Flight MH-17 lies with those who have been orchestrating the increasing flow of foreign fighters, arms and heavy military equipment to the east of Ukraine. That is part of the armed aggression.
Lithuania urges Russia to unequivocally distance itself from any kind of direct or indirect support to terrorists, separatists and foreign fighters in eastern Ukraine.
The ongoing illegal criminal activities by the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic and Donetsk People’s Republic are appalling. The numbers of civilians killed, injured or evicted increase every day. Armed gangs do not care about civilians in Donetsk and Luhansk, their human rights or their welfare. Both groups are headed for the terror list.
Tomorrow the Foreign Ministers of European Union will consider additional measures against those stoking the conflict in Ukraine. We urge States to stop military cooperation with Russia until Russia unequivocally commits to the peace, security and stability of its neighbours, including Ukraine. ","In our intervention last Friday during the briefing on the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 over Ukraine on 17 July (see S/PV.7219), we noted that the tragic and unfortunate incident could potentially mark a new dimension in the Ukrainian crisis that represented a grave threat to the safety of international civil aviation. That new global threat spurs us to consider what insecurity means to the human race. For that reason, we not only voted in favour of resolution 2166 (2014) but also sponsored it. Respect for international law, to the extent that it prohibits acts that threaten the safety of international civil aviation, is our guiding principle in the matter.
In adopting the resolution, the Council has once again demonstrated that, when it is united in purpose, it is capable of speaking with one voice in sending a strong message on matters of international peace and security. The resolution takes into account the concerns not only of members of the Security Council but also of well-intentioned nations around the world, in particular States that lost citizens in the crash. Principal among those concerns is the need for a comprehensive, thorough and independent international investigation in accordance with international civil aviation guidelines. It is crucially important for the outcome of the investigation to be credible and unimpeachable. In that regard, we welcome the involvement of the International Civil Aviation Organization, which has the appropriate expertise to share with the parties involved in the investigation.
No less significant is the question of accountability. The Security Council has demanded that those responsible for that heinous act be held accountable. We would like to emphasize that it is the obligation of States to cooperate fully in the efforts to find and to bring to justice those responsible for this brazen act, which violates not only international law but also the peace of the human race. ","On behalf of the Government and the people of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, allow me to extend my heartfelt condolences to the Governments and families of the victims of the Malaysian airliner downed over eastern Ukraine as a result of a criminal act.
My delegation welcomes the Council’s unanimous adoption of resolution 2166 (2014), which we sponsored and voted for out of our deep belief in the importance of unveiling the truth surrounding this incident by way of a thorough independent international investigation, with a view to holding the perpetrators of this crime accountable and to attain justice.
In addition to the impact of bringing closure to the victims’ families, we underscore the importance of all the relevant parties cooperating in the implementation of the resolution as soon as possible. The site of the incident must be safeguarded and the investigators must be granted unfettered access free of manipulation. ","Let me begin by thanking the delegation of Australia for preparing today’s resolution, as well as by welcoming the flexibility shown by Member States in its negotiation. The delegation of Chile sponsored and voted in favour of resolution 2166 (2014), as we believe that this is the appropriate response by the Council and that it sends a clear message about the need for an international investigation to be conducted that would be full, exhaustive and independent to look into the downing of Malaysia Airlines MH-17, in keeping with international law.
By its unanimous adoption the resolution, the Security Council has taken an important and necessary step towards clarifying facts and guaranteeing that those responsible for this incident be held accountable for their actions. This type of act cannot go unpunished. The families of the victims have the right to know the truth. That is why we once again urge all States, in keeping with their obligations under international law and under the relevant resolutions of the Council, to actively cooperate with the relevant authorities.
On behalf of my country, I would like to reiterate our solidarity and our most heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and to the Governments whose citizens were among the victims of this event. We hope that this terrible incident will serve as a reminder of how this crisis affects countries and families beyond the borders of Ukraine and of the need to resolve it. ","I welcome the presence among us of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Australia, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
Chad reiterates its deepest condolences to the families of the 298 victims and to the States that lost citizens in the crash. Chad commends Australia on its initiative. We also welcome the consensus among all the members of the Security Council with regard to resolution 2166 (2014), which we have just adopted. We also welcome the commitment and resolute determination of the Council to give an effective and appropriate response commensurate with this tragedy.
By sponsoring and voting in favour of this resolution, Chad hopes that full light will be shed on this heinous crime, which has taken nearly 300 innocent lives. In that connection, Chad demands guaranteed unhindered access to the crash and for the security of the international experts on the ground, so that they can fully independently and with complete transparency carry out the investigation under the authority of the Government of Ukraine, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the Netherlands and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. We underscore the need to safeguard the integrity of the crash site, so as to make it possible for the investigation to deliver the results expected of it.
The perpetrators of this tragedy must be identified and brought to justice. All the States Members of the United Nations must cooperate in establishing the facts and ascribing responsibility. ","The adoption of resolution 2166 (2014) is a decisive step by the Security Council. It is an unambiguous response of the international community to an utterly deplorable act — the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, killing all 298 passengers and crew on board, including 80 children. The passengers were citizens of Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines and the United Kingdom. The Governments of those countries have all co-sponsored this resolution today. For that I am deeply grateful. A number of victims were dual nationals of other countries. They were all innocent people on a commercial aircraft. Their plane was shot down over territory controlled by separatists in eastern Ukraine. This is an absolute outrage.
Our nation is devastated by the loss of so many Australians — 37 people who called Australia home. They were travelling home from Europe — a couple, both teachers, on holiday to celebrate their retirement; a 25-year-old travelling in Europe, like so many young Australians do. Yesterday, I spoke to a husband and wife from Perth who had been on a family holiday in Europe. They had decided to stay on for only a couple of days, while their three children — aged 12, 10 and 8 — had to return to school in Australia, so they went on ahead with their grandfather on Flight MH-17. The parents are inconsolable in their grief. Among the victims were scientists — medical researchers and doctors who were travelling to Melbourne for the International AIDS Conference that began yesterday. These were people who had dedicated their lives to helping others.
Our nation mourns the death of all the victims. I cannot begin to fathom the pain and anguish their families and friends are experiencing. But grief is now accompanied by outrage as we witness grotesque violations at the crash site. This demands a response. That is why Australia has brought this resolution to the Security Council. Today, the Security Council has responded.
Our resolution demands that armed groups in control of the crash site provide safe access immediately to allow for the recovery of the bodies, and that these armed groups stop any actions that compromise the integrity of the crash site. That is imperative. There must be a ceasefire in the immediate area around the site. The victims must be treated with dignity, brought back to their homes and laid to rest. All parties are required to fully cooperate with these efforts. Russia must use its influence over the separatists to ensure this. Russia must also use its influence to bring the conflict in Ukraine to an end.
Our resolution also demands a full, thorough and independent international investigation into this act. We must have answers. We must have justice. We owe it to the victims and their families to determine what happened and who was responsible. The resolution acknowledges the investigations already under way. It demands that safe, secure, full and unrestricted access to the crash site be provided so that the investigating authorities can carry out their work. It is despicable that this access is not being provided. It is an affront to the victims and their families. All States, armed groups — everyone — must cooperate with the investigation. We welcome the Secretary-General’s offer of assistance to the investigation. The United Nations will continue to have a crucial role to play.
The message from this Council to those who were responsible for this atrocity is definitive. They will be held to account for their actions. Australia will continue to do everything we can to ensure that this barbaric act is thoroughly investigated and that the perpetrators are brought to justice. We have an overriding objective to ensure dignity, respect and justice for those killed on MH-17. We will not rest until this is done. We will not rest until we bring them home. ","Canada mourns the terrible loss of lives of those aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 and wholeheartedly joins the co-sponsors of resolution 2166 (2014), which strongly condemns the atrocity. We urge an immediate, comprehensive, credible and unimpeded international investigation into the event, in accordance with the guidelines set up by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Time is of the essence, and it is vital that the pro-Russian groups currently in control of the crash site impede neither the work of investigative teams nor efforts to recover and repatriate the remains of the victims.
(spoke in French)
Canada welcomes the statement issued on 17 July by the trilateral contact group. However, declarations are not enough. Russia and the pro-Russia militants must match words with deeds and cooperate fully with the investigation. The conflict in eastern Ukraine has been both generated by and perpetrated by the Putin regime. Evidence of Russian financial and material support to illegal armed groups in eastern Ukraine is both clear and compelling, and President Putin’s continued support for those groups constitutes a threat to international peace and security. President Putin has the ability to end this war. He can do so by ending his support to pro-Russian forces, ending the build-up of troops on the Ukrainian border, withdrawing his troops from Crimea and using Russia’s considerable influence to broker a ceasefire.
(spoke in English)
The need for answers, for justice and for respect for the victims’ grieving friends and family members should unite all of us here today. Canada, as a nation and as host State to ICAO, stands ready to provide whatever support it can towards those ends. There must be justice. And to have justice, there must be truth. ","In the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, the Philippines lost a mother and her two children. The Philippines expresses once again its most sincere condolences to the families that lost their loved ones and to the Governments of the victims: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States and Viet Nam.
My delegation reiterates its condemnation of this incident in the strongest possible terms. The Philippines unequivocally supports calls for a full, thorough and independent international investigation — calls that have already been made by the Council and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The investigation should shed more light and definitive information into the circumstances surrounding this regrettable incident so that the perpetrators of this most offensive of acts will be held fully accountable.
The Philippines is concerned that the integrity of the crash site has been compromised, and in this regard urgently calls on the parties involved to secure the site of the crash and to grant investigators immediate and unfettered access to the crash site so that the investigation can commence without further delay. The remains of the victims need to be fully recovered, accounted for and given proper burial. We need to bring our loved ones home. We owe it to their memories and to their families. The perpetrators need to be identified and held fully accountable for this most revolting of acts. We must be united in ensuring that all necessary actions are undertaken so that justice is finally served.
My delegation is most grateful to Foreign Minister Julie Bishop of Australia for her leadership in preparing a draft resolution which later, with all her contributions and support, commanded a unanimous action by the Council. Resolution 2166 (2014) is an important action-oriented step towards achieving our common goal. The Philippines fully supports the resolution. We have co-sponsored the resolution. Indeed, we will support all efforts to secure justice for all and to honour the memory of the 298 irreplaceable lives in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.
We really hope that resolution 2166 (2014) will find its fullest implementation. This unspeakable tragedy demands complete closure.",,"I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Rwanda.
First of all, I would like to thank Australia for introducing resolution 2166 (2014), on the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the presence among us of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and European Affairs of Luxembourg and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands. There is no doubt that this incident has shocked the world and taxed us all, in particular the families and nations grieving their loved ones. I take this opportunity to once again offer the deepest sympathies and condolences of the President and the people of Rwanda to the families and to the Governments and compatriots of the 298 victims.
Rwanda co-sponsored and voted in favour of resolution 2166 (2014) primarily because, as a matter of principle, the deceased and their families must be accorded the utmost respect and the dignity that they deserve. We believe also that it is important that the facts surrounding the downing of this plane be established and that the perpetrators of this heinous crime be identified and brought to justice.
We were extremely troubled at the fact that separatist groups in eastern Ukraine have been obstructing and denying access to the crash site, not to mention removing bodies and the material elements necessary for the investigation. We condemn this behaviour in the strongest terms.
Let me recall that resolution 2166 (2014), which we just adopted, supports efforts to establish a full, thorough and independent international investigation into the incident, in accordance with international civil aviation guidelines. The resolution further demands that the armed groups in control of the crash site and the surrounding area refrain from any actions that may compromise the integrity of the site. In that regard, we urge the separatists to fully implement, without excuses or preconditions, their commitment made on 17 July in a videoconference with the Trilateral Contact Group.
Finally, Rwanda reiterates its call on the separatist groups in eastern Ukraine to respect the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, to adhere to a sustainable ceasefire, as requested by the 2 July joint declaration by the Foreign Ministers of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, France and Germany, and to engage in a political dialogue with the Ukrainian Government based on President Poroshenko’s peace plan.
I now resume my functions as President of the Council.
I now give the floor to His Excellency Minister Franciscus Timmermans, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. ","I would first like respectfully to welcome the presence of Ms. Julie Bishop, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia. On behalf of the Government and the people of my country, I convey to her our sincere condolences. I also extend the same to the families, the peoples and the Governments of all the victims. I also acknowledge the presence of the Foreign Ministers of Luxembourg and of the Netherlands, to whom we express our most heartfelt and profound solidarity.
Argentina would like to underscore the valuable work undertaken by the Australian delegation in facilitating the Council’s consensus adoption of a timely and necessary resolution. Such consensus is especially important given that the text put forward by Australia takes into account various different points of view and concerns on the part of members of this body, thereby illustrating the ethic of collective responsibility prevailing and the unambiguous priority of contributing, based on the Council’s prerogatives, to shedding light on this emotional event in order to arrive at the truth of what occurred in a reliable, objective and effective manner. That is what the victims and the entire international community deserve. The international community has a right to safe aviation without being subjected to acts that possibly violate international law. It should be fundamentally so as well as under the most basic elements of respect for the dignity of human life.
Given the reports received in the past few days about the limited access to the disaster site in Ukraine encountered by the authorities responsible for the investigation, the special monitoring mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and representatives of other international organizations, the Security Council could not remain silent or indifferent. It thus became as essential to express our heartfelt concern over the possible obstacles encountered by those responsible for the investigation, as to demand that immediate safe, full and unimpeded access be guaranteed to the site of the incident, while preventing any action that might compromise the site’s integrity.
Although the Security Council underscored that need clearly in its press communiqué of 18 July, today we find ourselves morally and institutionally compelled to demand the same. This continues to be the sole and the unanimous demand not just of the Council but of the entire world: that an immediate international inquiry be carried out under international civil aviation guidelines, leading to a thorough and effective independent investigation into the incident to determine objectively and unequivocally what occurred, and, based on the evidence gathered thereby, urging that the legal bodies with jurisdiction hold the perpetrators to account before justice for their acts.
Just as clearly and forcefully, we demand that any investigation be conducted free of any obstacles and based on the norms, principles and procedures set forth by the International Civil Aviation Organization and other international procedures on civil aviation.
By resolution 2166 (2014), the Council demands that all military activities cease around the area of the incident and that a safe environment be established in the area to provide access to investigators.
Argentina welcomes all the efforts being made by various States and organizations with a view to coordinating the various steps required for an impartial and coherent international investigation process.
We would also like to highlight the cooperation offered by the Secretary-General. In the resolution, the Council calls on him to identify possible options for the Organization to develop. It also requests that he keep the Council informed.
On 18 July Argentina said that we should be prudent at this painful and difficult moment (see S/PV.7219), including the members of the Council. We reiterate that today, for now is not the time to profer opinions or analyses of what happened based on geopolitical disputes, nor to engage in pointless accusation. The gravity and the pain resulting from this incident require serenity and reflection and, by way of reliable mechanisms, arriving at the full truth of the events and determining who is responsible.
In conclusion, Argentina sponsored and voted in favour of today’s resolution. We have joined in the call for all States and actors in the region to fully cooperate with the investigation and to ensure the respectful and dignified treatment of the remains of the victims. ","Luxembourg welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2166 (2014). We commend Australia, and more specifically my colleague Julie Bishop, for having taken the initiative to prepare this important decision of the Council.
Luxembourg voted in favour of the resolution and co-sponsored it for three reasons: to condemn in the strongest terms the downing of a civilian aircraft of Malaysia Airlines above Donetsk oblast, Ukraine, on 17 July; to express our solidarity with the families and friends of the victims who were on board of Flight MH-17, as well as with their countries of origin; and finally, to express our support for the ongoing efforts to shed light on this catastrophe through a full, thorough and independent international investigation in accordance with international civil aviation guidelines. Such an investigation is the only way to determine who is responsible for this unspeakable act.
Despite everything that divides us on the crisis concerning Ukraine, the Security Council was finally able to reach a consensus on the resolution. That was the least we could do to honour the memory of the 298 victims of this catastrophe — 298 lives lost to a crisis for which they bore no responsibility whatsoever and that has gone on for too long.
On behalf of the people and the Government of Luxembourg, I would like to express our most sincere condolences to the families and friends of the 298 individuals who were on board of Flight MH-17. Among the victims was a family living in Luxembourg — an Anglo-Dutch couple and two of their sons, aged 12 and 14. We share the grief of the people and Governments of the Netherlands, Malaysia, Australia, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, the Philippines, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, the United States, Ireland and Viet Nam. Allow me to express a special thought for the Netherlands, a country with which we have close ties and which has been struck in a particularly cruel manner by this catastrophe. I salute my colleague and friend, Minister of Foreign Affairs Frans Timmermans, who is with us today, and I assure him of our fraternal support in this difficult time.
Everything must now be done for the full implementation of the resolution we have just adopted. We must support the efforts being undertaken by Ukraine — in coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization and international experts, including representatives of States that have lost nationals on board the aircraft — to institute an international investigation into the downing of Flight MH-17.
The behaviour of illegal armed groups present on the scene of the disaster is unacceptable. Those groups must comply with the demands of the Security Council and immediately provide safe, secure, full and unrestricted access to the crash site near the village of Grabovo, in eastern Ukraine, to the appropriate investigating authorities, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) special monitoring mission, and representatives of other relevant international organizations. The illegal armed groups must refrain from any further action that could compromise the integrity of the crash site, and immediately cease all military activities in the immediate area surrounding it. We welcome in this regard the decision by President Poroshenko to declare, with immediate effect, a unilateral ceasefire in a radius of 40 kilometres around the scene of the tragedy. Resolution 2166 (2014) clearly underscores that the bodies of the victims must be treated in a dignified, respectful and professional manner. All parties concerned must ensure that that requirement is immediately observed.
We call on the Russian Federation to actively and unremittingly use its influence on the illegal armed groups so that they cease their actions and despicable manoeuvres to prevent a genuine and appropriate investigation. The Russian Federation must immediately bring its full weight to bear on those groups so that they cease to obstruct the investigation and to remove compelling evidence, in particular the remains of the missile used to bring down the plane. The bodies of the victims must be returned to their families and the black boxes must be handed over to the competent authorities.
The international investigation into the tragic incident of 17 July must establish the facts and responsibilities. In the resolution just adopted, the Council rightly demands that those responsible for the incident be held to account for that heinous act and that all States fully cooperate with the efforts to establish responsibility. The Security Council must remain vigilant in that regard on the basis of the reports on the investigation made to it by the Secretary-General. We owe it to the victims and their families that justice be done and that the perpetrators of that criminal act be held accountable.
The deaths of 298 innocent human beings leave a huge void. That disaster cruelly reminds us of the urgent need to achieve a de-escalation of tensions in eastern Ukraine. The crisis has lasted too long. Its toll in terms of the loss of human lives is mounting every day. We must step up diplomatic efforts to find a solution to the crisis. The first priority is to establish a true and lasting ceasefire that is observed by all parties in order to create the necessary conditions for the implementation of President Poroshenko’s peace plan.
In that regard, we welcome the efforts of France and Germany, as well as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, to promote dialogue between Russia and Ukraine. It is high time that all stakeholders, in particular the Russian Federation, cooperate in good faith in order to put an end to the crisis and so that 17 July appears in the history books as a day marked not only by the tragic deaths of 298 innocent people but also as a decisive turning point in settling the Ukrainian crisis. ","The Republic of Korea welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2166 (2014), on the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in eastern Ukraine. On behalf of the people and the Government of the Republic of Korea, I once again extend my most heartfelt condolences to all the affected countries and bereaved families. We share their sorrow during this difficult time.
We would like to welcome the Foreign Ministers of Australia, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, to whom we offer our solidarity.
We believe that the resolution we adopted today is a firm and united response by the international community to the heinous act of downing a civilian aircraft. The most urgent task before us at this moment is to establish the solid facts of what caused this tragedy to occur and who is responsible for it, through a full, thorough and independent international investigation. We recognize in particular the role of the International Civil Aviation Organization and the Ukrainian Government in conducting such an international investigation. We have full confidence in the supporting role of the United Nations in that regard.
In order to shed full light on the tragedy, no less pressing is the need to preserve the integrity of the crash site and to secure immediate, safe and unrestricted access to it by competent international investigators. It is also vital that the bodies of the victims be recovered without delay and treated in a dignified and respectful manner. We very much hope that the resolution will be instrumental in ensuring a credible international investigation through its full implementation by all parties concerned, particularly the separatist armed groups.
The Security Council should remain vigilant as to developments on the ground and respond further if what is required by the resolution does not fully materialize. We once again stress that the perpetrators of the incident, if it turns out to be the result of a deliberate attack, must be brought to justice as promptly as possible."
S/PV.7219,18/07/2014,Downing of the MH-17 Flight: Briefing and Expresison of Sympathy,"I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing. China is shocked and grieved by the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in eastern Ukraine. On behalf of the Chinese Government and people, I express our sincere condolences and deep sympathy to the victims and their families. The safety of international civil aviation must be guaranteed. Our priority now is to establish the facts. Pending that, it is not advisable to jump to any conclusion, make any assumptions or trade accusations. We support the holding of an independent, fair and objective investigation into the incident. We also call on all parties to coordinate and cooperate during the investigation. The recent situation in Ukraine remains turbulent. Armed conflict and incidents of violence frequently occur, causing loss of life and destruction of property. China is deeply concerned about the situation. We hope that the parties concerned will take into account the well-being of the entire population of Ukraine, focus on maintaining regional peace and stability, stay calm and exercise restraint to prevent the further escalation of the conflict and confrontation. The crisis in Ukraine is rooted in a complex situation that is both historical and contemporary. A political solution is the only way out. China notes the recent constructive efforts of the parties concerned to achieve a ceasefire through dialogue and to promote a political solution. We hope that the parties concerned will remain committed to dialogue and negotiations, take the rights and aspirations of all regions and etnic groups of Ukraine fully into account and bear in mind the legitimate concerns of all the parties involved so that the rights of all parties can be respected in a balanced way. We urge the parties concerned to effectively implement the agreed ceasefire and to strengthen dialogue and consultation on the basis of the Geneva agreement in pursuit of a political solution and the prompt achievement of stability and development in Ukraine. China respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, including Ukraine. China will continue to adopt a fair and objective approach and actively participate in any proposal or initiative that will reduce tension and promote a political solution. We will play a constructive role in that process.","I thank Mr. Feltman for his briefing. I wish to extend my deepest condolences to all the Permanent Representatives of the countries that lost citizens in this tragic event. I would like in particular to extend our condolences to our colleagues from the Netherlands and Malaysia. We also mourn with the people of the Netherlands. Yesterday a Malaysia Airlines flight with nearly 300 passengers aboard crashed in the separatist-controlled area of Ukraine, and the French President expressed his enormous sorrow at the announcement of the disaster. Today I reiterate France’s solidarity with the victims’ families in the ordeal they are experiencing. Given this tragedy and the already chaotic situation, France requests that all efforts be brought forth to shed light on the circumstances that led to the tragedy. We call for an independent international inquiry that would allow the facts to be established and to draw the necessary conclusions. We ask that all measures be taken to facilitate the work of the investigators on the ground. In particular, we expect the separatists to cooperate with the Ukrainian authorities in the investigation and to allow safe, immediate and full access to the investigators, in accordance with the decision made yesterday during the video tele-conference between the contact group involving Ukraine, Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the separatist representatives. A glimmer of hope had begun to dawn in Ukraine at the end of last month. With the election of Mr. Poroshenko, a process of political normalization had begun. A unilateral ceasefire, declared by Kiev on 20 June, hinted at a possible end to the general deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in the east. On that same day, President Poroshenko initiated a comprehensive peace plan in order to arrive at a peaceful resolution of the situation. Furthermore, following their meeting on the sidelines of the ceremonies marking the Normandy landing, a process of almost daily exchanges between Presidents Poroshenko and Putin and Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande led to the start of a useful dialogue. Moreover, a joint statement was adopted in Berlin on 2 July that provided for the quest of a lasting ceasefire via the meeting between the contact group and the separatists, strengthened border control on the Russian-Ukrainian border to curb the flow of weapons and fighters, and the agreement of the OSCE to participate in that effort. Nevertheless, today the situation continues to deteriorate. For several days, fighting has escalated in eastern Ukraine because the separatists have refused to clasp the hand being extended to them. Every day the attacks are ever more deadly. Weapons never used until now have begun to be used and have struck Ukrainian territory. Two Ukrainian planes were shot down in their own airspace. That could happen only if one of the parties possessed sophisticated anti-aircraft weaponry. Moreover, this unprecedented deterioration is also due to the presence of armed fighters coming from outside Ukraine. The question of outside support in terms of recruitment, supplies of materials and training cannot be avoided. The answer is too obvious. It is irrefutable. Weapon systems with significant firepower are being used, which can lead to tragic blunders. Those who are responsible for arming those who use those weapons bear the responsibility for this conflagration. As I said in an earlier statement, when bandits are given weapons we cannot be surprised that they behave like bandits. All those events point to the pressing need for full cooperation by the international community in order to stabilize Ukraine and ensure its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We also call for a sincere commitment from Russia, one that so far has been lacking. The day before yesterday, the Heads of State and Government of the European Union acknowledged that the many appeals made to Moscow to end its non-cooperative stance had not been heard. That is the reason for the European Union’s decision to impose tougher sanctions. However, the strengthening of those sanctions has one and the same goal: to facilitate the emergence of a political solution. Our priority remains, first, to end the escalation and establish a lasting ceasefire that is respected by all parties. That is why we call on Russia to engage constructively in that endeavour and to bring its influence to bear on the illegal armed groups to lay down their arms and engage in dialogue. Separatist activity must end. In order to slow down the flow of weapons and fighters that cross through the Russian-Ukrainian border on a daily basis, we call for negotiations between Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE in order to allow the rapid deployment of a monitoring mission at the border. Let this tragedy at least serve as a warning to all the parties. Once the bullets have been shot, they strike indiscriminately and escape all control. We have reached such moment. It should still be possible to avoid the worst.","First, we would like to express our heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families and friends of the passengers and crew of the Malaysia Airlines flight that crashed in Donetsk, as well as to the Governments of the countries whose citizens were on the list of victims of the tragedy. An open and impartial investigation of the incident is necessary. There must be no pressure placed on the investigation, or attempts to prejudge its outcome through broad statements or unfounded allegations. Given the complexity of the situation, we believe it would be proper to establish an international commission under the aegis of International Civil Aviation Organization. I am certain that any normal person would, first and foremost, ask the question as to what led a Ukrainian aviation dispatcher to send a passenger flight through an area of military clashes — an area being used to carry out strikes against civilian targets, among others, and where anti-aircraft systems were operating. In line with international standards, ensuring the security of civilian aviation in a State’s airspace is that State’s responsibility. The State over whose territory a flight is planned must provide the information necessary to ensure the safety of aviation. International law provides for a State’s timely ability to close off areas deemed dangerous for flights. It would seem that an investigation is necessary not only of the disaster, but also of the extent to which Ukrainian aviation authorities carried out their obligations to exercise the relevant law and did everything necessary to ensure that Kyiv’s military campaign prevented disasters. Today Kyiv announced the full closure of its airspace to conduct a so-called anti-terrorist operation. Why could that not have been done earlier, instead of waiting for there to be hundreds of victims? During our previous meeting on Ukraine (see S/PV.7205), some Western members of the Council talked about the restraint exercised by the Kyiv authorities in using force. They have fully demonstrated that “restraint” now. There have been indiscriminate air strikes, rocket fire and attacks by artillery tanks in Donetsk and Luhansk. This punitive operation is becoming increasingly destructive for the civilian population and infrastructure. Dozens of civilians have been killed, including children. Transport systems, community facilities and medical centres have been destroyed. According to data of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are more than 4.5 million people in eastern Ukraine in the area of the clashes. However, Kyiv has not evacuated civilians from those areas. Instead, people must risk their lives to flee the areas of military clashes by themselves. There are many reports of people being intentionally targeted by the Ukrainian armed forces as they flee the war, in particular to seek refuge in Russia. To date, Russia has hosted more than 110,000 refugees from eastern Ukraine. That figure continues to grow daily. Those facts have been confirmed by UNCHR. In that regard, six Russian regions have declared a state of emergency. Artillery and mortar shelling by the Ukrainian armed forces into Russian territory has become a regular occurrence. The targets include border crossing points and peaceful civilians. Our citizens have been killed and wounded. We consider those provocations acts of aggression on the part of Ukraine against Russian citizens and against its sovereign territory. We place all blame on the Kyiv authorities and call for the Ukrainian side to take decisive measures to prevent such incidents in future. We have repeatedly issued warnings about the danger of trying to resolve the political crisis in Ukraine by force. We called for a mutually respectful and inclusive dialogue among all major political forces, Kyiv and the regions. However, the Kyiv authorities have chosen the wrong the path at every turn, with the support of its Western colleagues. I am talking about the United States, of course, which pushed Kyiv to escalate the crisis. They are trying to lay the blame on Russia for the catastrophe caused by the course chosen. Kyiv cast aside the agreement of 21 February and the road map proposed by the Chair of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The Geneva statement of 17 April and the Berlin declaration of 2 July were also dismissed, although representatives from the Kyiv Government took part in drafting them. The widely acclaimed peace plan of President Poroshenko became the pretext for military preparations and the deployment of a large-scale punitive operation. The Kyiv authorities have chosen to suppress dissent. Immediately after the February uprising, Kyiv began to call dissenters “bandits” and “terrorists”, and then “subhumans” and “insects”. Was it fortuitous that on Channel 5, the Ukrainian television channel owned by Mr. Poroshenko, a commercial was aired showing the stamping out of insects with a map of eastern Ukraine in the background? Protesters have been massacred in Mariupol and Odesa. The number of victims continues to rise and no genuine investigation has been carried out. Dozens of people who politically opposed Kyiv have disappeared. The promised reform of the Constitution is being prepared in secret. It appears that Kyiv would like to enlist the support of European structures and then give it to its lucky people. Indeed, according to reports, the redistribution of powers from the President to the Parliament, which was the source of the fighting in Maidan for months, is not actually being planned for. Is it any wonder that violence has been the result of such strategy? The political representatives of those regions are well known. They have long been a part of Ukraine’s political life, and have come to the forefront through the protest movements in recent months. Involving them in the dialogue would prevent a further escalation of the current serious crisis, but instead Kyiv chose to arrest, beat and threaten them. With regard to the Ukrainian crisis, international institutions have not risen to the occasion. The reason lies with our Western partners. Much has been said, but nothing has been done to resolve the situation. We are working hard in the OSCE. In the Security Council, the Russian delegation proposed three times the serious drafting of a resolution that would put an end to the violence in Ukraine. But Western colleagues responded to our proposals with blatant cynicism. It seems that whatever the Ukrainian Government arbitrarily does is judged favourably, but the victims of the geopolitical ambitions of the Ukrainian regime are actually an entire nation — the people of Ukraine. The punitive operation in eastern Ukraine must be stopped immediately. Negotiating a resolution to the crisis is still possible, but the right choice must be made.","We meet today in the most tragic of circumstances. Yesterday, Malaysia Airlines passenger flight MH-17 appears to have been shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all passengers and crew. Our deepest, most heartfelt condolences go to the families of the victims and to the people and Governments of those countries affected. In the United Kingdom, we are mourning the loss of at least nine British citizens who were passengers on the flight. This is a dark moment for the international community. The senseless violence unleashed by armed separatists in eastern Ukraine has reached monstrous proportions. The precise circumstances and causes of this tragic event must be established quickly and beyond any doubt. As the Council has affirmed this morning, that will require a full, thorough and independent international investigation, in accordance with international civil aviation guidelines. The International Civil Aviation Organization, which provides the international legal framework for the investigation of air accidents, should have a central role to play in ensuring that there is credible and independent international involvement. We welcome the indications from the Ukrainian authorities that they want international investigators to join their efforts. The United Kingdom will provide whatever assistance is necessary to support that investigation. The immediate priority has to be for investigators to gain access to the crash site so they can start their work. They must be able to operate unhindered and in security. There must be no interference or tampering with the evidence. Armed separatist groups in the vicinity must allow such access. Despite assurances made yesterday evening, we understand that has not yet happened. We call on Russia to use its influence with those groups to ensure that it happens. The special monitoring mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe already present in eastern Ukraine can play a key role in facilitating and safeguarding access. Early indications are that Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 was brought down by a surface-to-air missile. The MH-17 is not the first aircraft to be brought down in the area. On 14 June, armed separatists claimed responsibility for — indeed, gloated publicly over — the shooting down of a Ukrainian Il-76 transport aircraft, with a loss of all 49 aboard. On 14 July, armed separatists shot down an An-26 transport aircraft with a surface-to-air missile. And, on 16 July, a Ukrainian Su-25 jet was shot down in circumstances that have yet to be fully clarified. We have to ask searching questions about why we are now confronting this tragic situation. Russian officials have claimed that armed separatists in eastern Ukraine represent a spontaneous local insurgency. We know that is not the case. We know that the three leading figures of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic are Russian citizens who have come from outside Ukraine. We know that weapons, equipment and logistical support have been systematically provided to armed separatist groups by Russia, including up to 100 man-portable air defence systems and 15 to 25 main battle tanks, not to mention artillery pieces, rocket launchers and other armoured vehicles. The United Kingdom urges Russia to reflect carefully on the situation it has created. We urge Russia to cease its policy of supporting armed separatist groups and their violent actions of destabilizing a neighbouring country and of generating displacement and social and economic hardship. Let us hear today a clear and unequivocal condemnation from Russia of the actions of these armed groups. These armed groups do not represent the people of Ukraine; without Russian support, they would wither. It is the Council’s responsibility to respond to such tragedies by drawing the right lessons and working together with commitment and conviction to prevent their repetition. It is clear where responsibility lies: with the senseless violence of armed separatists and with those who have supported, equipped and advised them. The Council must be united in condemning these actions and in demanding that these groups disarm, desist from violence and intimidation and engage in dialogue through the democratic mechanisms that are available to them. They have been given opportunities to do so, most recently through President Poroshenko’s peace plan. Those opportunities have all been spurned. In the press statement agreed earlier today, the members of the Security Council expressed their condolences and called for an international investigation and appropriate accountability. That is welcome, but it is not enough. The Council must go further. It should come together behind a clear demand that the armed separatist groups should lay down their arms and pursue whatever political legitimate objectives they may have through exclusively peaceful and democratic means, and that the flow of arms, fighters and logistical support to the armed separatists be fully halted and the borders secured. In the light of yesterday’s tragedy, any other course of action would be unconscionable.","Yesterday we were all shocked by the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. All 298 people aboard — 283 passangers and 15 crew members — were killed. As we stared at the passanger list yesterday, we saw next to three of the passangers’ names a capital “I”. As we now know, that letter stands for “infant”. To the families and friends of the victims, it is impossible to find words to express our condolences. We can only commit to them that we will not rest until we find out what happened. A full, credible and unimpeded international investigation must begin immediately. The perpetrators must be brought to justice; they must not be sheltered by any State Member of the United Nations. Let me share with the Council our assesment of the evidence so far. We assess that Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, carrying 298 people from Amsterdan to Kuala Lumpur, was likely downed by a surface-to-air missile (SAM) — an SA-11 — operated from a separatist-held location in eastern Ukraine. The airliner was travelling at a cruise altitude of 33,000 feet, and its speed was typical for an airliner along an established flight corridor frequented by commercial traffic. The flight was transmiting its assigned transponder code, corresponding with its flight plan, and flight tracking data was publicly available on the Internet. There was nothing threatening or provocative about MH-17. Of the operational SAM systems located near the border, only the SA-11, SA-20 and SA-22 systems are capable of hitting an aircraft at the flight’s altitude of 33,000 feet. We can rule out shorter-range SAMSs known to be in separatist hands, including man-portable air defence systems, and SA-8 and SA-13 systems, which are not capable of hitting an aircraft at that altitude. Early Thursday, an SA-11 SAM system was reported near Zahnitkiv by a western reporter, and separatists were spotted hours before the incident with an SA-11 system at a location close to the site where the plane went down. Separatists initially claimed responsibility for shooting down a military transport plane, and posted videos that are now being connected to the Malaysia Airlines crash. Separatist leaders also boasted on social media about shooting down a plane, but later deleted those messages. Because of the technical complexity of the SA-11, it is unlikely that the separatists could effectively operate the system without assistance from knowledgeable personnel. Therefore, we cannot rule out technical assistance from Russian personnel in operating the systems. The Ukrainians do have SA-11 systems in their inventory; however, we are not aware of any Ukrainian SAM systems in the area of the shoot-down. More important, since the beginning of the crisis Ukrainian air defences have not fired a single missile, despite several alleged violations of their airspace by Russian aircraft. This also follows a pattern of actions by Russian-backed separatists. On 13 June, separatists shot down a Ukrainian transport plane carrying 40 paratroopers and 9 crew members. On 24 June, as the Council was meeting to welcome Ukraine’s unilateral ceasefire (see S/PV.7205), we received word that separatists had downed a Ukrainian helicopter, killing all nine aboard. On 14 July, separatists claimed credit for downing a Ukrainian military cargo plane flying at 6,000 metres. And on 16 July they claimed credit for the downing of a Ukrainian fighter jet. If indeed Russian-backed separatists were behind this attack on a civilian airliner, they and their backers would have good reason to cover up evidence of their crime. It is therefore extremely important that an investigation be commenced immediately. In the first instance, the special monitoring mission the of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe should act as a first responder, thereby laying the foundation for efforts by other international organizations and individual nations, including those whose citizens were victims of the tragedy. Yesterday, President Obama assured Ukraine’s President Poroshenko that United States experts would offer all possible assistance upon his request. President Poroshenko has invited the independent and credible International Civil Aviation Organization to join an investigation. International investigators must be granted immediate, full and unfettered access to the crash site. All those concerned — Russia, pro-Russian separatists and Ukraine — should agree to support an immediate ceasefire to facilitate access by international investigators. In that regard, we look to the monitoring misson also to reach agreement with separatists and others in the region to make that possible. All evidence must remain undisturbed and any evidence removed from the site by the Russian-backed separatists operating in the area should be promptly returned and handed over. Russia needs to help make that happen. While it make take us some time to firmly establish who shot down a plane filled with innocents, most Council members and most members of the international community have been warning for months about the devastation that would come if Russia did not stop what it started — if it did not reign in what it unleashed. The context for yesterday’s horror is clear: separatist forces backed by the Russian Government continue to destabilize Ukraine and undermine the efforts of Ukraine’s elected leaders to build a democratic Ukraine that is stable, unified, secure and able to determine its own future. Russia says that it seeks peace in Ukraine, but we have repeatedly provided the Council with evidence of Russia’s continued support to the separatists. Time after time, we have called on the Russian Government to de-escalate the situation by stopping the flow of fighters and weapons into Ukraine, pressing separatists to agree to a ceasefire and release all hostages, and support a road map for negotiations. Time after time, President Putin has committed to working towards dialogue and peace — in Geneva in April, in Normandy in June and in Berlin earlier this month — and every single time he has broken that commitment. Here is what we know. In the past few weeks, Russia has increased the number of tanks, armoured vehicles and rocket launchers in south-west Russia. More advanced air defence systems have also arrived. Moscow recently transferred Soviet- era tanks and artillery to the separatists, and several military vehicles crossed the border. After recapturing several Ukrainian cities last weekend, Ukrainian officials discovered caches of weapons long associated with Russian stockpiles, including MANPADs, mines, grenades, meals ready to eat, vehicles and a pontoon bridge. Ukrainian forces have discovered large amounts of other Russian-provided military equipment, including accompanying documentation verifying Russian origin, in the areas they have liberated from separatists in recent days. Recruiting efforts for separatist fighters are expanding inside Russia, and separatists have openly said that they were looking for volunteers with experience in operating heavy weapons such as tanks and air defences. Russia has allowed officials from the Donetsk People’s Republic to establish a recruiting office in Moscow. Ukrainian pilot Nadia Savchenko, who has long had a distinguished career in the Ukrainian military, was taken by separatists in mid-June. She is now being held — where? — in a prison in Voronezh, Russia. According to the Ukrainian Government, she was transferred to Russia by separatists. Russia continues to redeploy new forces extremely close to the Ukrainian border. In addition, on Monday, a Ukrainian air force cargo plane was shot down in Ukrainian air space, and on Wednesday a Ukrainian fighter jet was also shot down in Ukrainian air space. In both instances, the Ukrainian Government believes that the planes were fired on from Russian territory. It is because of such continued destabilizing Russian actions that the United States imposed sanctions on the defence, energy and financial sectors of the Russian economy, including financial institutions. The measures include freezing the assets of Russian defence companies and blocking new financing of some of Russia’s most important banks and energy companies. The sanctions are significant, but they are also targeted and designed to have the maximum impact on the Russian calculus while limiting the impact on the Russian people and any spillover effects on our interests or those of our allies. This week, the European Union also announced expanded sanctions on Russia. The message is unified and clear: if President Putin continues to choose escalation over de-escalation, the international community will continue to impose costs on Russia. But that is not what any of us want. We and our allies remain committed to a diplomatic solution, as are the Ukrainian Government and the Ukrainian people, who have seen their neighbours, friends and family members killed in a needless conflict. President Poroshenko has consistently backed up his words with actions. He proposed a comprehensive peace plan and declared a unilateral ceasefire, both of which were cynically rejected by the illegal armed groups and their backers in Moscow. President Poroshenko’s plan offered amnesty to separatists who voluntarily laid down their arms and who are not guilty of capital crimes. He committed to providing a safe corridor for Russian fighters to return to Russia. He established a job-creation programme for the affected areas, made an offer of broad decentralization and dialogue with eastern regions, including the promise of early local elections, and granted increased local control over language, holidays and customs. President Poroshenko has also reached out to the regions of eastern Ukraine and is pursuing constitutional reforms that will give local regions more authority to choose their regional leaders and protect locally spoken languages. He has said that he will meet with separatists in any safe location, inside or outside Ukraine. The goal of the United States throughout the crisis in Ukraine has been consistent, namely, to support a stable, peaceful and democratic Ukraine. We will not be satisfied with a temporary halt to violence. Russia must stop destabilizing Ukraine and allow all the people of Ukraine to decide their country’s future through a democratic political process. As we sit here, the remains of nearly 300 people — innocent infants, children, women and men — are strewn across a blackened, smouldering landscape in Ukraine. The victims came from at least nine different nations; they could just as easily have come from any of ours. We must treat all of them as our own victims. We have a duty to each and every one of those individuals, their families and their countries to determine why that jet fell out of the sky and to hold the perpetrators accountable. We must stop at nothing to bring those responsible to justice. This appalling attack occurred in the context of a crisis that has been fuelled by Russian support for separatists through arms, weapons and training, by the Russian failure to follow through on its commitments and by its failure to adhere to the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter. The tragedy only underscores the urgency and the determination with which we insist that Russia immediately take concrete steps to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine, support a sustainable ceasefire and follow the path towards peace that the Ukrainian Government has consistently offered. This war can be ended. Russia can end this war. Russia must end this war.",,,,,,,,,,,"I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting. I also thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing. This tragedy would not have been possible if Russia had not supported the terrorists and if a sophisticated anti-aircraft system had not been provided to them from Russia. On many occasions, the Ukrainian Mission to the United Nations has addressed the Security Council and all States Members of the United Nations and has given them information about Russia’s support for the terrorists in eastern Ukraine. Only yesterday, we presented new evidence to United Nations-accredited media. The huge supply of weapons of Russian origin being used by terrorists in Donbas, which has been documented by the Ukrainian intelligence agencies, the media and the general public, is no longer a secret to anyone. A large exhibition of confiscated modern weapons, seized by the Ukrainian military forces from terrorist groups, took place in Kyiv a few days ago. In most cases, the actual military units of the Russian armed forces are specified as the origin of those weapons. The documentation can be accessed on the website of the Ukrainian Mission and from my press conference yesterday, which can be found on the United Nations website.
We have raised our concern several times here in the Chamber that Russian nationals are directly participating in destabilizing the situation in eastern Ukraine. Some colleagues have today given some information about the Luhansk and Donetsk leaders proclaiming republics. All their military commanders are of Russian origin. Illegal armed groups of fighters are stepping up their recruitment efforts within Russia. They seek volunteers with experience in operating heavy weapons, such as tanks and air defence equipment. Russia has allowed the establishment of recruitment offices in Moscow and Rostov, which are openly recruiting and sending Russian nationals to Ukraine’s eastern regions. Yesterday at the press conference, we described all the websites that are calling for recruits. Numerous groups of Russian paramilitary formations, including Russian Cossacks, are actively supporting the terrorists in spreading terror and chaos in the eastern part of Ukraine.
Throughout the entire period of such articifically created confrontations, supported by Russia, that country has never publically called on its citizens to refrain from joining the illegal armed groups operating on the territory of Ukraine. That fact speaks for itself. Paragraph 2 of article 208 of the criminal code of the Russian Federation states the following. “Participation in armed groups that are not governed by federal law, as well as participation in such armed groups on the territory of a foreign State for any purpose against the interests of the Russian Federation, is punishable by 5 to 10 years’ imprisonment”.
Since no Russian national has been brought to justice for such actions, there is only one conclusion: their participation in illegal armed groups on the territory of Ukraine does not contradict the interests of the Russian Federation.
The situation on the Ukrainian-Russian State border has significantly deteriorated in recent days as a result of systematic violations coming from the Russian side of the border, as well as the provocative actions of armed terrorist groups in the border areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Several times a day, columns of military vehicles and Russian mercenaries attempt to break through the Ukrainian State border from the Russian side. Such attempts are actively facilitated by Russian border protection units. The anti-terrorist forces in Ukraine have been repeatedly shelled from the territory of Russia. Ukraine has documented evidence of all those facts for the appropriate international response.
The number of provocations on the Ukrainian-Russian State border has increased substantially. Illegal armed groups systematically fire towards the territory of Russia in order to create the false image of Ukrainian military fire. That caused the death of a Russian citizen. The Russian side accused the armed forces of Ukraine of shelling on Russian territory on 28 June, namely, Mine No. 24 of Vasetskaya village in the Krasnosulynsky district of the Rostov region and the Gukovo border checkpoint. The Ukrainian armed forces have never attacked or fired on the territory of Russia. All such provocations are committed by pro-Russian terrorists in order to find grounds for a further escalation. Today’s statement by the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, about the possibility of carrying out strikes against the territory of Ukraine sounds like a new provocation.
Today, colleagues have presented some evidence of the deteriorating situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border. Every day during the month of July, we have observed such violations, including the shooting-down of Ukrainian jets. I would like to take this opportunity to once again draw the attention of members of the Security Council to the fact that Russia continues to redeploy new forces extremely close to the Ukrainian border. As of 14 July, the total number of groups of Russian armed forces in the areas bordering Ukraine has significantly increased. They comprise 33 battalion tactical groups, with a total of at least 40,000 troops directly around Ukraine, including up to 18,000 troops in Transnistria and up to 21,000 troops in the occupied territory of Crimea. Those and similar actions constitute a flagrant violation by Russia of its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and other universally recognized principles and norms of international law. Those actions are incompatible with the obligations of the Russian Federation under the Geneva agreement of 17 April and the Berlin declaration of 2 June.
Despite all the international efforts, supported by the strong Ukrainian will to prevent a further escalation and further strengthened by the President’s peace plan, the foreign terrorists and their Russian supporters have no intention of leaving us in peace or laying down their arms. We are still struggling against high-capacity military saboteurs who are willing to destroy Ukraine and to establish havens for chaos and instability.
Ukraine demands that the Russian side immediately cease provocations on the State border of Ukraine, stop hindering the efforts of the Ukrainian side and the international community to put an end to terrorism and other violence in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, return to President Poroshenko’s peace plan, withdraw its forces from the Ukrainian border and stop threatening peace and security in our country, the region and the world as a whole.
I would like to start by expressing my Government’s sorrow and deep condolences to all the Missions whose citizens were killed in the terrible crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. Ukraine shares the pain of their loss and grieves with their bereaved families and friends. My country extends its profound sympathy to those affected by the accident. Today, all of Ukraine is mourning. Ukrainians are visiting the Embassies of the Netherlands, Malaysia, Australia, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, the Philippines and Canada in order to leave flowers and express their sorrow.
The Ukrainian authorities have already called on international organizations, including the International Civil Aviation Organization, Interpol and others, to undertake a thorough international investigation of the accident. We believe that an impartial investigation will reveal the truth and that all perpetrators will be punished.
Yesterday, the Ukrainian leadership announced a basic version of what happened with the flight: it was an act of terror. The position of our Government is based on converging data from different intelligence and open sources, which show that the aircraft was shot down over territory controlled by terrorists. Two Ukrainian jets were shot down near the same location several days before, with terrorist leaders claiming responsibility for those acts. Intercepted telephone conversations between the terrorist leaders and their coordinator — Russian military intelligence colonel Vasili Geranin — confirm that terrorists are behind this crime. That conversation was recorded, and the Secretariat has promised to convey it to members of the Security Council.
Immediately after the crash, the military leader of the terrorists, Igor Girkin Strelkov, who is of Russian origin, boasting on social networks, commented on having shot down what he believed to be a Ukrainian jet, saying the following.
“In Torez, Ukraine, an AN-26 has been shot down. It is lying somewhere near the Progress coal mine. We have warned everyone not to fly in our skies”.
To target and shoot down an aeroplane at an altitude of as high as 10 kilometres would be possible only by using a sophisticated anti-aircraft system, such as the SA-11 Buk missile system, or a similar system. It has been affirmed both by the radio interception of terrorist leaders and by photographs and video-recordings obtained from citizens of cities in the area, that the terrorists have at least two SA-11 Buk missile systems. The question is, where did they get those sophisticated anti-defence systems? I reiterate that radio interceptions, photographs and the confessions of detained terrorists, including two recently detained Russian citizens who were going to join the terrorists as military experts, state that the Buk system came from Russia. All that and other evidence and information will be provided to the international investigation. ",,,,"I thank the President for convening today’s meeting.
As a matter of priority, on behalf of the Government and the people of Indonesia, I wish to express our deepest condolences to all affected nations, especially our good neighbour Malaysia, over the deaths of the 298 civilian passengers and crew aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, which crashed yesterday as it was flying over eastern Ukraine. As the Council may be aware, 12 Indonesian citizens were confirmed among the deceased. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims. Allow me also to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the delegations that have expressed their sympathy and condolences to Indonesia.
According to various sources and reports, the airplane was presumably shot down by a surface-to-air missile. If that is indeed the case, such a heinous act is tantamount to a grave violation of international law, in particular international humanitarian law. In that regard, Indonesia calls upon the Security Council to take immediate steps to enable a thorough, transparent and independent international investigation to be conducted upon this horrendous incident.
Indonesia stands ready to join and support such an investigation. If the investigation concludes that the crash was indeed intentionally caused by human factors, be it a missile strike or otherwise, Indonesia demands that the perpetrators of such a heinous and inhuman crime be brought to justice to the fullest extent of the law.
As a precautionary measure, yesterday my President instructed all Indonesian airlines to exercise the utmost caution and to avoid the airspace in and around conflict areas, including that of Ukraine.
In conclusion, as a member of the Association of Southeast Ansian Nations family, Indonesia reiterates its solidarity with the Government and the people of Malaysia, as well as with the countries whose citizens have fallen victim to this tragedy. ",,"I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the opportunity to participate in this meeting. I would also like to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing.
On behalf of the Government and the people of Belgium, I would like first to express my most heartfelt condolences to the Government of Malaysia, as well as to the families and friends of the 298 people who were aboard the Malaysia Airlines plane shot down in eastern Ukraine. There were five Belgian nationals among the victims. Our thoughts are with those who mourn today, in particular the friends and families and the Government of the Netherlands, a country close to us.
Like others who preceded me have done, Belgium launches an appeal to all the parties to guarantee full access to the disaster site, not only for the search and rescue teams but also for the investigators. A full, detailed, thorough and impartial international investigation should be conducted to determine the exact circumstances surrounding the MH-17 disaster.
In that regard, Belgium supports the proposal of Australia that the Security Council adopt a draft resolution that stresses the need for guaranteed access to the site and for the conduct of a full, independent international investigation. We owe it to the victims and their families, as well as to ourselves, to shed full light on what happened yesterday in eastern Ukraine. ",,,,"It was with profound grief that we learned of the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in eastern Ukraine on 17 July, which caused the tragic loss of the lives of all the passengers and crew members. My delegation has just been informed that, of the four victims whose nationalities had not yet been identified when the Ambassador of Malaysia spoke, three of them are Vietnamese. We would like to convey our deepest sympathy and condolences to the Governments, the peoples and the bereaved families at this moment. As a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Viet Nam stands in solidarity with the Government and the people of Malaysia. The President, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Viet Nam have conveyed their deepest condolences to the Government and the people of Malaysia.
We call for expeditious, effective and responsible actions by the relevant authorities and parties on behalf of the families of the victims and in order to address other related issues. Viet Nam also requests a prompt and transparent investigation into the incident. We hope that this incident will soon be resolved through efforts and determination by the relevant authorities and parties.
Viet Nam is closely following the situation in Ukraine. We are extremely concerned about the recent complicated developments in the eastern provinces of Ukraine. We sincerely hope that all the parties concerned will exercise restraint and avoid any actions that could aggravate the situation and cause casualties among civilians, while at the same time making efforts through peaceful dialogue to find solutions that ensure the legitimate interests of all parties and to meet the people’s aspirations for peace, stability and development in Ukraine and the region. ",,,,,,,,,"I thank you, Mr. President, for granting me this opportunity to deliver a message from my Minister under these exceptional circumstances. I would like to thank the members of the Security Council for their words of compassion and the condolences expressed by them. Yesterday almost 300 innocent men, women and children lost their lives aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when the plane crashed on Ukrainian soil. This horrible event has shocked the world and deeply saddened all countries that have lost compatriots. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who mourn the death of loved ones, wherever their cradle may have stood.
At least 189 victims were Dutch nationals. Today, many thousands in my country, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, grieve for the loss of parents, children, loved ones, friends and co-workers. This is a dark hour in our national history. We are a nation in shock and in tears. But we are also a nation united in our determination to seek the truth about what happened.
We call on all parties that have any influence on the matter to grant unfettered access to the crash site to emergency responders and investigators alike. We call on the Security Council, the world’s highest authority, to mandate a full, thorough and impartial international investigation into the exact circumstances surrounding the crash of Flight MH-17. All the relevant materials recovered from the site, including the airplane’s black boxes, should be made available to the international investigation immediately and without interference.
Should an investigation show that the tragedy is the result of the use of weapons, the Netherlands will condemn that despicable act in the strongest terms and will demand that all those responsible, both directly and indirectly, be held accountable and brought to justice. That is our moral obligation to the memory of the victims, and our duty in the light of international law and justice. My country will not rest until justice is served.
We want to bring the victims’ remains home to their loved ones as soon as possible. We ask the United Nations to help us achieve that. Those who mourn, wherever they may reside, deserve to know what caused the deaths of their loved ones. Our nations deserve to know what happened. The world has a right to know. ",,,,,,,,"I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this debate and for allowing New Zealand to make this statement. I will be brief, but discussion of an international incident that brings death to New Zealanders demands some comment.
New Zealand joins with others in expressing its deepest sympathy to the families, friends and colleagues of all those who have died. We also express our solidarity with our close friend Malaysia — indeed, with all the countries whose people have died. Our thoughts and prayers are with them all at this incredibly sad time.
We express outrage at the mounting evidence that this totally unnecessary and avoidable tragedy resulted from a surface-to-air missile strike. If that evidence is confirmed, this is a grave crime that demands an international, thorough, credible and independent investigation. We call in particular for protecting the integrity of the crash site.
New Zealand welcomes the calls for such an investigation — from the Secretary-General, the Security Council and many others. The circumstances of this tragedy, the catastrophic nature of its occurrence and its occurrence in a conflic zone mean that the international community, in particular those like New Zealand and others that have lost nationals, has a right to demand such an investigation. Any party with relevant informaton that can help in that process must offer its proactive assistance and cooperation. Perpetrators must be brought to justice: no qualifications, no ifs, no buts, no maybes.
The situation in Ukraine has now gone beyond dangerous. It now kills people from other parts of the world with no direct involvement in the local conflict. This morning families in New Zealand and many other countries are waking up to the tragic reality that they have lost loved ones to a conflict that threatens international peace and security and demands the ongoing attention of the Council. ","At the outset, allow me to congratulate you, Mr. President, and the Republic of Rwanda on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month. I thank you, Sir, for convening this emergency meeting of the Council on Ukraine. I also wish to thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, for his briefing earlier. For my delegation, the convening of this meeting is indeed timely given the tragic incident involving Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17.
Malaysia is deeply touched by the expressions of condolences, sympathy and support from across the world. At this difficult time, we also wish to express our profound sorrow and convey our deepest sympathy and condolences to the families and friends of those who were aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17.
Malaysia is shocked and distraught by the downing of Flight MH-17. The scheduled flight, which departed Amsterdam yesterday afternoon Amsterdam local time, was expected to arrive at Kuala Lumpur International Airport this morning. Unfortunately, it crashed near the town of Torez in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.
Two hundred and ninety-eight people perished in the incident. One hundred and eighty-nine of those who perished were from the Netherlands, 44 from Malaysia, 27 from Australia, 12 from Indonesia, 9 from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 4 from Germany, 4 from Belgium, 3 from the Philippines, 1 from Canada and 1 from New Zealand. The nationalities of four passengers have not yet been verified.
The Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur route, which regularly crosses Ukrainian airspace, was one of Malaysia Airlines most popular routes. According to the International Air Transport Association, at the time that contact with Flight MH-17 was lost, the aircraft was flying over non-restricted air space. Furthermore, the International Civil Aviation Organization had declared the flight path to be safe. Malaysia Airlines also confirmed that the aircraft had not made any distress calls.
The Government of Malaysia has taken immediate action to dispatch a special Malaysia disaster assistance and rescue team to Kyiv. The team includes personnel from the Royal Malaysian Air Force, Malaysia Airlines, the Department of Civil Aviation as well as medical staff. In addition, 40 Malaysia Airlines staff have been despatched to Amsterdam to support the victims’ families and next of kin. In that regard, Malaysia welcomes the pledges of support and assistance made by other countries to aid in the search, rescue, recovery and investigation efforts.
Yesterday, Prime Minister Razak spoke to President Poroshenko of Ukraine, Prime Minister Rutte of the Netherlands, President Obama of the United States of America and President Putin of the Russian Federation. In those conversations, Prime Minister Razak stressed that, if indeed Flight MH-17 had been shot down, the perpetrators must be swiftly brought to justice. Malaysia condemns in the strongest possible terms any such action as a flagrant violation of international law and an outrage against human decency. Malaysia demands a full, independent and transparent international investigation into the incident, involving the relevant international authorities, including the International Civil Aviation Organization. I wish to inform the Security Council that Malaysia has been formally invited by the Ukrainian authorities to take part in the investigation and that we will be sending two representatives to Kyiv as soon as possible.
We urge the parties in conflict in the area of the crash site to provide the fullest cooperation. Such cooperation also entails facilitating safe and unhindered access for the investigators and humanitarian personnel to carry out their missions, including collecting the relevant data, evidence, remains and personal effects of the victims.
We wish to underscore that there must be no interference at the crash site or any movement of debris from the area, including the flight data recorders, or black boxes. The integrity of the crash site must be preserved. Malaysia also urges the Security Council to undertake the necessary measures to ensure the safety and security of humanitarian and investigative personnel at the crash site in order for them to discharge their duties and responsibilities.
No further facts have been established at this point, but the fact that the plane might have been shot down has made the matter even more painful for us. Again, this is a grave reminder of how the escalation of disputes and threats to international peace and security can claim innocent lives in a most tragic and senseless manner. In that regard, we urge the Security Council to step up its role in facilitating a peaceful resolution to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine with a view to preventing the recurrence of such a tragic incident.
In conclusion, on behalf of the Government and the people of Malaysia, I wish to reiterate our deep appreciation for all the expressions of support, sympathy and solidarity in this difficult and trying time. ",,,"We are deeply shocked by yesterday’s downing of a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 in eastern Ukraine. We express our sincere condolences to Malaysia, the Netherlands, Australia, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, the Philippines, Canada and the other nations whose citizens were among the 298 people who perished. Our deepest sympathies go to the families of the victims.
The circumstances of the downing must be established by an independent, international investigaton, in accordance with international civil aviation guidelines. The perpetrators cannot escape responsibility. Investigators must immediately be granted access to the crash site and the black boxes must be handed over to independent authorities in order to prevent the evidence being tampered with.
The circumstances are impossible to ignore. They all point in one direction, namely, that this horrible crime was committed as part of the armed aggression against Ukraine. The responsibility for that terror act lies with those who are aggressively preventing Ukraine from effectively exercising its sovereign rights over its territory and airspace. It would not have happened had Russia not armed and instigated the presence of separatist groups in Donetsk and Luhansk provinces. The international community cannot stand by in the face of such aggression. The country has become a threat to international peace and security. We have said that all along since the occupation of Crimea.
The debris of the Malaysian plane lies in an area controlled by pro-Russian separatists. This week alone, a Ukrainian AN-26 cargo plane and an Su-25 fighter jet were shot down by pro-Russian separatists from a high altitude. The third — a Malaysian passenger plane — was deliberately shot down. An Il-76 transport plane and half a dozen helicopters were brought down by pro-Russian separatists at Luhansk airport and elsewhere. In June, separatists boasted of possessing an SA-11 Buk missile system. They claimed to have used the system to shoot down the An-26 cargo plane at high altitude. Separatist commander Igor Strelkov claimed to the media to have shot down another aircraft at the same time as the Malaysian Airlines flight was overflying the area.
We are truly shocked by the number of victims among the civilian population in eastern Ukraine. Armed separatists, terrorists and foreign fighters and their supporters bear the responsibility for the deaths and injuries among the civilian population, including children, women and the elderly. The carnage must end. President Poroshenko proposed a peace plan. Ukraine declared a unilateral ceasefire. The agreement in Berlin on 2 July provided a vehicle for talks. Yet separatists and terrorists in the eastern part of Ukraine continued to sow terror, loot, rob banks, racketeer, kidnap people and traffic in human beings.
The massive and continuous influx of foreign fighters from across the Russian border into the neighbouring Luhansk and Donetsk regions has gone unabated. That influx has been accompanied by T-65 tanks, Grad multiple rocket launchers, anti-aircraft guns, towed anti-tank guns, BTR armoured personnel carriers, man-portable air defence systems and small arms. In fact, the terrorists in Donbas hardly bothered to remove the markings of Russian military units from their heavy weapons. Russian military helicopters and drones violate Ukrainian airspace, while 40,000 troops are encamped within minutes of the Ukrainian border, in addition to the 20,000 troops stationed in occupied Crimea. Russian citizens, many of whom are veterans of the conflicts in Chechnya and Transdnistria, lead many of the terrorist groups.
The Russian media channels are putting out ongoing anti-Ukrainian propaganda. The mouthpiece of the separatists, Life News, boasts of the agility of rebels to shoot down any plane in sight. The terrorists and separatists continue to take hostages. The abducted and hooded Ukrainian pilot Nadia Savchenko was trafficked by separatists from Ukraine straight to the Russian Voronezh pretrial detention centre. We condemn the unlawful detention of Ukrainian citizens in Russia. Russia must respect the norms of international law and release Savchenko immediately. We remain appalled by the deteriorating human rights situation in Crimea.
Lithuania urges the holding of a full, thorough and independent investigation into the downing of the Malaysian Airlines flight, as agreed today by the Council. Lithuania urges Russia to unequivocally distance itself from any kind of direct or indirect support for terrorists, separatists and foreign fighters. The insurgents must lay down their weapons. Lithuania calls on Russia to cooperate with Ukraine in order to ensure the security of the borders and to prevent weapons and armed terrorists from entering the territory of Ukraine. We call on Russia to constructively cooperate on the implementation of the peace plan put forward by President Petro Poroshenko. A diplomatic solution is possible. Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, including Crimea, are non-negotiable and must be respected by all. ","I first want to say to our colleagues whose citizens were involved that we convey our deepest condolences to their families, citizens and Governments.
Yesterday at noon, the world watched in horror the downing of the Malaysian jetliner. What happened yesterday seemed to be an apocalyptic end to the world. I think Ambassador Power described it similarly. The spectacle is graphically described, respectively, in chapters 8 and 9 of the Book of Revelation: “hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the Earth”, “the sun and the air were darkened”. That was what I saw yesterday.
No matter our religious beliefs, that scenario may become a self-fulfilling prophesy if States continue to choose to open or support theatres of war and conflict in every corner of the world. What will happen is that the world will self-annihilate. Enough is enough.
The fact that this incident occurred as the plane flew over eastern Ukraine, which, for some time now, has been a zone of conflict, indicates that the accident may be connected, in one way or another, to the conflict. But this is not the time to play the blame game.
If it is established that the plane was shot down deliberately, it will mark a new dimension in the Ukraine crisis, one that represents a grave threat to the safety of international civil aviation.
At this point, it is of critical importance for the facts surrounding the crash to be dispassionately well-ascertained. In that regard, we would like to express our full support for an independent international investigation, as called for by the Secretary-General.
Noting that the plane went down in an area under the control of armed rebel groups, we urge that those groups cooperate fully and unconditionally with the investigation into the crash.
We have no doubt that, without the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the widespread insecurity and lawlessness engendered by the activities of the rebel groups in the eastern part of the country, this tragic accident would not have occurred.
We want to renew our call for a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine and a return to dialogue and negotiation, within the framework of the Geneva statement of 17 April and the 2 July four-party talks in Berlin.
Let us together resolve this issue. Let us together close this war front, before its reverberations become manifest in other parts of the world. ","Jordan expresses its deep regret over the criminal incident that led to the downing of the Malaysia Airline aircraft over eastern Ukraine yesterday. We also express our deepest condolence to the Government of Malaysia and to all the families of the victims who were killed in that disastrous incident.
Jordan calls for an independent, full and comprehensive investigation of yesterday’s incident, including the participation of the relevant Ukrainian authorities and cooperation with other relevant authorities, including the Malaysian authorities.
The Jordanian Government is gravely concerned over the deteriorating situation in eastern Ukraine, which has taken a new and very dangerous turn following yesterday’s events. Previously, Jordan expressed its great concern for the deteriorating situation in eastern Ukraine. We hereby reaffirm our call for all influential parties in Ukraine to act in order to end the deterioration, to exert pressure on the insurgents to disarm and to withdraw from the facilities and buildings they are occupying, and to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in order to restore stability to eastern Ukraine. We also call for a guarantee that the displaced people can return to their homes as soon as possible.
Jordan urges all the parties to the Geneva statement and the Berlin joint declaration to abide by their provisions. We call upon all the relevant parties to facilitate the work of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, especially in eastern Ukraine.
Jordan reaffirms the importance of respecting the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine.
In conclusion, we urge the Ukrainian Government to continue its efforts aimed at promoting the political participation of all Ukrainians and ensuring the full implementation of international conventions on human rights while taking into consideration the concerns of minorities and non-Ukranian speakers. ","On behalf of my country, I would like to begin by expressing our outrage at the attack carried out yesterday in which Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 was shot down in eastern Ukraine, killing 298 people, including children. We condemn that act in the strongest terms, and we extend our sympathy and condolences to the victims’ family members and to the Governments whose citizens were among the victims. No cause can justify an act of that magnitude and cruelty.
We are closely following the information that is emerging about what happened. In that context, we call for carrying out a comprehensive, transparent and independent investigation in accordance with international civil aviation standards, in order to ensure accountability. It is also necessary that all facilities be provided and security be ensured for the immediate access of investigators to the crash site in order to determine its cause with certainty.
There can be no impunity for this type of act. Its perpetrators must face justice. The victims’ family members have the right to know the truth. We therefore call upon all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and the relevant Security Council resolutions, to actively cooperate with the relevant authorities.
The downing of this aircraft, in an area where there is a high level of political tension, increases the danger of escalating the current violence and drawing new actors into the fray. Therefore, more than ever, we emphatically call on the parties to exercise the utmost restraint in order to contain the crisis in eastern Ukraine. ","I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing on the recent tragic events in Ukraine.
Chad expresses its deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the 298 victims of the crash of the Malaysia Airlines aircraft. Given the numerous nationalities among the victims, this tragic event has an impact on peace and security throughout the entire international community. Whatever the nature and perpetrators of this incident, this is about human lives. Chad joins the rest of the international community in calling for the launch a full and transparent international investigation to shed light on the circumstances surrounding the crash and to establish responsibility for the catastrophe. In that regard, we welcome the willingness of Ukrainian authorities to expand the investigation to include independent international experts.
At this time sensitive time of grief, Chad reiterates its call on all parties involved to exercise calm and restraint. We urge countries with influence on the parties to the conflict to encourage dialogue and reconciliation. Chad takes note of the announcement by the insurgents that they would observe a ceasefire to allow for the removal of bodies, as well as the willingness of the Ukrainian Government to implement a peace plan with a view to establishing the foundation for an inclusive political dialogue, which is the only possible way to resolve this serious crisis. ","The downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in Ukrainian territory on 17 July has shocked the world. We have witnessed the tragic death of 298 people. There were 28 Australians on board Flight MH-17. Our nation is in mourning for all the victims. The news that the lives of 80 children were lost is devastating. Tomorrow, flags will be flown at half-mast across Australia. We extend our heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the families of all the victims of the tragedy and to their countries of nationality. Our particular thoughts are with the Governments and the people of the Netherlands and Malaysia.
There is mounting evidence that the crash was caused by a missile strike and that the aeroplane was brought down over territory not controlled by the Ukrainian authorities. There is increasing credible information that that was conducted by separatist militia groups, acting with the assistance of others. We owe it to the victims of this tragedy and their families to unequivocally establish the facts behind the incident and to find out exactly what happened and who is responsible. If, as appears increasingly likely, Flight MH-17 was brought down by a missile, then that is, as Australia’s Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said, “an unspeakable crime”, and the perpetrators must be brought swiftly to justice.
There must be a full, thorough and impartial international investigation. We thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his message that the United Nations is fully prepared to cooperate with any investigation and that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has offered its investigative capacity. We also welcome Mr. Feltman’s information that ICAO and the Government of Ukraine are communicating on the issue of an investigation.
There must be immediate preservation of the crash site, and unfettered access for independent investigators. Safe access must also be provided to allow fro the recovery of the bodies of those who lost their lives in the tragedy. Undertakings brokered by the trilateral contact group with armed separatists who control the territory in which the crash occurred to allow access must be upheld. Our Prime Minister has made it clear that Russia’s full cooperation with all investigations is expected. The Council has just issued a press statement calling for investigation, accountability and immediate access to the crash site. That is welcome, but Australia believes, given the gravity of the incident, that it is not a sufficient indication of the Council’s resolve. Australia believes the Council should adopt a draft resolution that emphasizes the need for access to be granted to the crash site and for a full, thorough, independent and international investigation to be carried out.
This is the nineteenth time that the Council has met to discuss the situation in Ukraine since the crisis began. Time and time again, the overwhelming majority of the Security Council has called for a end to the violence and destablization. Council members have consistently called for a de-escalation of tensions, for separatists to lay down their weapons and for genuine dialogue to commence. It is time for the equivocation and dissembling and false narratives of some to stop.
In the three weeks since the Council last discussed the situation in Ukraine (see S/PV.7205), the security situation in the east has become increasingly dire. Separatists have ignored repeated calls to disarm and have continued their attacks on Ukrainian military forces, facilities and border posts. Two Ukrainian military cargo planes were downed in eastern Ukraine in the past week alone. The Ukrainian armed forces have responded firmly to those attacks. They has every right to restore law and order, and they have underlined their commitment to do so in proportionate manner.
Russia has a crucial role to play in de-escalating this persistently dangerous crisis. It must end its provocations and any support for separatist forces. It must control its border with Ukraine and prevent the flow of weapons, equipment and fighters from Russia into Ukraine. Russia must withdraw the large number of troops it has again amassed on the Ukrainian border. It must actively work to de-escalate tensions and use its considerable influence with separatist groups in Ukraine to that end.
Further political efforts are essential. The four-party talks in Berlin in the past two weeks showed some promise. The parties agreed on the need for a sustainable ceasefire, the resumption of the contact group, control of border crossing points monitored by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and an extension of the work of the OSCE observer mission to include border monitoring activities. But we have yet to see results; those efforts must be redoubled.
We thought that the situation in Ukraine had already caused too much tragedy. The horrific loss of Flight MH-17 has added immeasurably to that toll. It is time for the international community to stand as one to ensure that those responsible for that tragic crime are held to account and to make every effort to bring to an end the violence and destabilization in Ukraine. ","I thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity to take the floor, although this is a day of such great sadness for the entire international community.
(spoke in English)
Canadians are shocked and saddened by the terrible loss of life in the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine. With evidence mounting that the airliner was brought down by a surface-to-air missile, we are increasingly convinced that this is not only a tragedy but also very likely the result of an outrageous crime, perpetrated against hundreds of innocent civilians of many nationalities.
Canada calls on all the parties to the conflict in Ukraine to cooperate fully with an international investigation into the incident. Both Ukrainian authorities and international experts must be permitted full and secure access to the crash site, and must be provided access to all the relevant data and evidence pertaining to the downing of the aircraft. We commend the Government of Ukraine for launching an investigation, and we thank the people of Ukraine for their sincere expressions of condolence to all those affected by this tragedy, including Canada. Canada stands ready to provide whatever support it can to assist authorities in determining the cause of the crash.
Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was brought down in a region of Ukraine embroiled in armed conflict. This is a conflict generated and perpetuated by Russia’s provocative military actions against the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine. We once again call on Russia to cease its political, financial and material support to armed insurgents in eastern Ukraine. Following the loss of so many lives aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, the grave international consequences of Russian-sponsored violence in eastern Ukraine are now plain for all to see. ","I thank you, Mr. President, for calling this emergency meeting.
It is with great sadness that the Philippines received confirmation that Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 had crashed in eastern Ukraine yesterday, 17 July. The downing of MH-17 is a most shocking and confounding event. Aboard that flight were 298 irreplaceable lives. Today we are united in grief. The Philippines conveys its most heartfelt condolences to the families and to the Governments and the peoples who lost their lives in the incident. Today we are united in denouncing this regrettable incident. The Philippines condemns in the strongest possible terms the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.
This incident is revolting, in particular in view of troubling and disconcerting reports that the crash was occasioned by a targeted move. The Philippines joins the call to immediately secure the area of the crash site, to launch an independent, transparent and international investigation into the incident and to provide full and safe access to investigators to the scene of the crash to enable them to swiftly conclude and report on the results of the investigation. ",,"I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Rwanda.
I thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, for his availability and for his detailed briefing, prepared on such short notice.
Allow me, first of all, to express my deep sorrow over the loss of the 298 lives, including 80 children, who were killed on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, which was shot down in eastern Ukraine. On behalf of the Government of Rwanda, I express my deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, as well as to the people and the Governments of the victims. The loss of those innocent civilians is beyond comprehension. Their lives were cut off in the middle of a crisis on which this very Council has been unable to take action since it began in February.
With the shooting down of a civilian airplane carrying civilians, the Ukrainian crisis is no longer a conflict between the Ukrainian military and armed separatists. The conflict has crossed a red line by endangering all our lives, as if did in the case of the men, women and children from different countries who were aboard Flight MH-17. We condemn in the strongest terms this reckless attack and call for a comprehensive, independent, international investigation in accordance with international guidelines, as agreed in the press statement adopted this morning. Such an investigaton should establish responsibility so that the perpetrators can be held accountable. In that context, we further urge all parties to cease fire, to fully cooperate with the investigation and to grant unhindered access to the crash site in order to allow international investigators to carry out their work.
We note that yesterday’s criminal act follows the downing of a Ukrainian fighter jet on Wednesday and that of a military cargo plane on Monday. The frequent use of surface-to-air missiles during the past few months raises the question of access to such weapons, which, as we have now seen, are capable of downing a civilian airplane flying at over 30,000 feet. Therefore, the Security Council and the broader international community can no longer afford to turn a blind eye on the matter. It is unfortunate that this tragic event comes at a time when national and regional efforts are under way to find a political and diplomatic solution to the Ukrainian crisis. This act undermines valuable initiatives of the trilateral contact group of senior representatives of Ukraine, the Russian Federation and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, who were making all necessary efforts for a resumption of consultations with separatists in eastern Ukraine. On Tuesday, the group reconfirmed its support for President Petro Poroshenko’s peace plan, as well as its commitment to a sustainable ceasefire, as stated in the joint declaration issued in Berlin on 2 July by the Foreign Ministers of Germany, France, the Russian Federation and Ukraine.
In conclusion, let me renew our call to the armed groups to respect the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. They must lay down their weapons and engage in constructive dialogue with the Ukrainian Government. In the same vein, we urge all parties to immediately cease fire and support the ongoing efforts to de-escalate the crisis and bring peace to Ukraine and the region.
The shooting down of a civilian plane in the midst of the conflict in eastern Ukraine is a stark reminder of the moral responsibility of Security Council members to set aside their divisions on this crisis, to hold the perpetrators of this criminal act to account and to uphold their mandate to maintain international peace and security.","I would like to thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing on the latest events in Ukraine and for expressing the constant willingness of the Secretary-General to contribute to peace and dialogue.
The Government and the people of Argentina express their profound sadness, pain, solidarity and deepest condolences to the families of the victims of yesterday’s tragic Malaysia Airlines crash. We also express our condolences to the people and the Government of Ukraine and to the Governments and the peoples of the other countries whose citizens lost their lives. In particular, we ask that our colleagues among the Permanent Representatives of the countries whose citizens were aboard that flight convey our condolences to the families, especially to those who saw the hopes for their children’s futures extinguished.
The severity of this event clearly demands action. Like our colleagues, Argentina calls for an impartial international investigation that objectively and unequivocally establishes what happened. Responsibility and the facts must be determined as soon as possible, and investigators must be granted immediate, unhindered access.
Although it is not today’s topic, I should like to say that, while there had been encouraging indications that the crisis in Ukraine was entering a phase of waning tension, fears that violent confrontation would continue have not dissipated. But the topic today does involve calling once again for the armed groups to cease their violence and demanding that they halt unilateral actions and their violations and trampling of human rights, which do nothing but deepen the crisis and worsen the situation, especially for the civilian population and for the innocent.
We reiterate the need to safeguard due respect for Ukraine’s conduct of its internal affairs without interference — whether military, political or economic — in matters under its jurisdiction. Argentina seeks to promote full respect by everyone for the principles of international law and human rights law as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.
These are sad and difficult times. Argentina therefore calls for prudence. We will not join in using the language of geopolitical disputes. We will not join in a pointless blame game. This is a time for sorrow, reflection and an urgent search for the truth behind the incident to determine those responsible. May the victims rest in peace. ","I also thank the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, for his briefing.
At the start of my remarks, I wish to express, on behalf of the Government and the people of Luxembourg, my most sincere condolences to the families and relatives of the 298 people aboard the Malaysia Airlines aircraft that crashed yesterday afternoon near the village of Grabovo in eastern Ukraine. Among the victims was a Dutch-English family living in Luxembourg. Our sympathy also goes out to the Governments and the peoples of the Netherlands, Malaysia, Germany, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Indonesia, New Zealand, the Philippines and the United Kingdom.
The international community owes it to the victims to shed light on the circumstances that led to this tragic event. A transparent and independent comprehensive international investigation must be completed as soon as possible. Safe and unhindered access must be granted to international investigators, as well as to observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and representatives of affected countries. All parties involved should fully cooperate to that end. We commend the Ukrainian authorities in that regard. Those who committed this heinous act must be held accountable.
This air disaster took place in a context of the ongoing deterioration of the situation in the east of Ukraine. Day after day, we receive reports of civilians killed in fighting between the Ukrainian armed forces and illegal armed groups. The pro-Russian separatist militias continue to occupy buildings and border posts, hold dozens of innocent people hostage and threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. The living conditions of people living in areas affected by the hostilities continue to deteriorate, and the number of internally displaced persons has steadily increased. The escalation of violence in recent days, until its tragic climax yesterday, demonstrates once again that active armed groups in eastern Ukraine are actually well-equipped and well-trained paramilitary forces who enjoy clear external support.
We urge the Russian Federation to actively use its influence on the illegal armed groups and ensure that weapons and fighters can no longer cross the border, in order to bring about a de-escalation as soon as possible.
Throughout the past few months, Ukraine has demonstrated its commitment to finding a peaceful solution to the crisis and to implementing the agreements concluded, in particular the joint declaration adopted on 17 April in Geneva between Ukraine, Russia, the European Union and the United States. Ukraine has established a national dialogue and guarantees for national minorities. Once elected, President Poroshenko put forward a comprehensive peace plan and put in place a unilateral ceasefire to create the conditions necessary for its implementation. Unfortunately, illegal armed groups, whose sole aim is to destabilize Ukraine, chose not to take that outstretched hand.
Diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine must continue. In that regard, the personal commitment of the Secretary-General since the beginning of the crisis is essential and must continue.
It is important to urgently reach an agreement on a real and lasting ceasefire that is observed by all parties, so as to create the conditions necessary for the implementation of President Poroshenko’s peace plan.
We welcome the efforts made in that regard by France, Germany and the OSCE to promote dialogue between Russia and Ukraine. We sincerely hope that those efforts will contribute to a de-escalation and put an end to a crisis that has gone on for too long. Yesterday’s plane crash demonstrated the incalculable consequences that the crisis can have. It is high time for all stakeholders, including the Russian Federation, to mobilize all energies to put an end to this crisis. ","I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing on the tragic incident in Ukraine.
The Republic of Korea expresses its utmost shock and outrage at the downing of the Malaysia Airlines passenger plane in eastern Ukraine yesterday. We deplore the loss of nearly 300 innocent civilian lives aboard that commercial airliner. On behalf of the people and the Government of the Republic of Korea, I extend my deepest condolences to the people and Governments of Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Netherlands, the Philippines and the United Kingdom and other affected countries. Our hearts go out to the families of the victims at this difficult time.
A thorough and independent international investigation, involving, among others, the International Civil Aviation Organization, must be conducted immediately. Whoever is responsible for the tragedy must be held fully accountable. If this incident turns out to have been caused by a deliberate attack, the Republic of Korea, itself a former victim of hostilities against a civilian airlines, believes that the international community should do everything in its power to bring the perpetrators to justice as quickly as possible. No one should be allowed, for any reason, to get away with killing so many innocent people, who had nothing to do with what is happening on the ground.
We support the ongoing efforts to bring stability to Ukraine, in particular the efforts of the United Nations, the European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and bilateral partners. Such efforts, aimed at de-escalating the violence in eastern Ukraine, should continue despite the daunting challenges. "
S/PV.7205,24/06/2014,De-escalation of the conflict in Donbas and peace/reform initiatives undertaken by Ukraine,"I thank Assistant Secretaries-General Zerihoun and Šimonović for their briefings. Recently, some areas in Ukraine have experienced continuous unrest, armed conflict and frequent violence, resulting in heavy tolls on people and property. China is deeply troubled by that situation. Conflict and violence have led to an increase in the internal displacement of persons in Ukraine and a shortage of water, electricity and food. We hope the United Nations and the international human rights and humanitarian agencies will adhere to the principles of neutrality and objectivity in their work. On the question of Ukraine, I would like to highlight the following points. First, a political solution is the only way to resolve the crisis in Ukraine. We take note of the fact that President Poroshenko announced a peace plan and declared a unilateral ceasefire, and that the armed groups have also declared a ceasefire. China welcomes any efforts that would de-escalate tensions in Ukraine and hopes that all parties will keep calm and exercise restraint, take this opportunity to enhance mutual trust and implement the ceasefire in conflict areas in a practical manner so as to create favourable conditions for a political solution. Secondly, the crisis in Ukraine has historical roots and a very real complexity. A comprehensive solution of the crisis calls for consideration of the overall situation. The solution should be long-lasting and balanced and take into account the legitimate rights, interests and demands of all regions and people in Ukraine, address the legitimate concerns of all and strike a balance of the interests of all sides. Thirdly, relevant actors of the international community are actively engaged with each other on the question of Ukraine. That is conducive to addressing the concerns and differences of all parties through peaceful and political means and avoiding conflict and confrontation. Such momentum should be sustained. The Geneva four-party joint diplomatic statement and the road map of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which reflect the wisdom and good will of all sides, should be implemented effectively and comprehensively. Fourthly, a swift and proper solution of the crisis in Ukraine is not only in the interest of the country and its people but also in the interest of regional peace and stability. China respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, including Ukraine, and we will continue to hold a fair and objective position in actively taking part in the consideration of any proposals and initiatives for the easing of tensions and for finding a political solution. We will play a constructive role in that process.","I, too, wish to thank Mr. Zerihoun for his briefing and Mr. Šimonović for introducing the third report of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine. I understand that the Ukrainian authorities have accepted the renewal of the mission’s mandate for the next three months. We welcome that. The mission is an invaluable source of information in terms of giving an overview of the situation in Ukraine. The report submitted by Mr. Šimonović covers an important event in the history of the country — the election of Petro Poroshenko as the new President of Ukraine. Despite the obstacles placed before the people of the east in the exercise of their right to free expression, voting proceeded normally in the rest of Ukraine. As the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has stressed, international norms were respected. Mr. Poroshenko is therefore the new legitimate President of Ukraine and has been recognized as such. His talks in Normandy during the ceremonies to commemorate the 6 June 1944 landing, as well as his inaugural ceremony, are evidence of that. This is an important stage because the election has given birth to a process of political normalization. Mr. Šimonović’s third report sheds light on the important steps taken by the Government of Ukraine, particularly in the context of implementing the Geneva statement of 17 April. Round tables were organized to bring diverse sectors of Ukrainian society together, and a draft law entitled “Memorandum of concord and peace”, which provides for the decentralization of power and guarantees on the status of the Russian language, has been adopted by the Rada. The report also notes that investigations are under way into the serious human rights violations committed during the events of Maidan Square, as well as those that took place in 2 May in Odesa. While there has not yet been a full clarification of those tragic events, it should nonetheless be stressed that efforts have been made to that end. The cooperation of Ukraine with the United Nations human rights monitoring mission on this issue has also been significant. Those elements show that, despite the many difficulties that have arisen, Ukraine is in the process of achieving its political transition. Despite such positive developments, eastern Ukraine, including Donetsk and Luhansk, has experienced a general deterioration in its security, human rights and humanitarian situation under the sway of illegal separatist armed groups. The third report stresses that arbitrary arrests, kidnapping, torture and murder now affect not only journalists, public officials and human rights activists, but the population as a whole. Mr. Šimonović has just informed us that the situation has grown even worse over the past week. In that regard, I remind the Council that eight OSCE observers have been held by separatists since late May, which poses an unacceptable obstacle to that Organization’s mission. The violence, as has already been confirmed, is fueled and sustained from outside. The presence of those foreign elements and all foreign support for them must cease. Control of transborder movements is critical. In such conditions, the Government of Ukraine is responsible for taking appropriate and proportional measures, with respect for international law, to combat the armed groups, protect the populace and ensure control of its own borders. Those operations impact the population’s access to basic services. Some residents have been forced to flee areas of confrontation and take refuge in other regions of Ukraine or in the Russian Federation. No one can deny that humanitarian needs exist. That is why humanitarian actors on the ground are already mobilized to respond. Coordinating all these responses not only among the various agencies but also with the Ukrainian authorities is essential. Indeed, the Ukrainian Government has taken all necessary steps to provide shelter to those who have been forced from their homes. I note that all regions of Ukraine, east and west alike, have responded to the call for solidarity. The sense of unity and of sharing a common destiny clearly exists in Ukraine. As the mission report points out, the imposition of Russian law in Crimea, which was illegitimately annexed by Russia, has created a situation of judicial instability that prevents the local population from exercising its human rights and basic freedoms. Discrimination in hiring is rampant. Leaders and human rights activists of the Tatar community are being prosecuted. It is increasingly difficult to keep two nationalities, and those who refuse to inform the Russian authorities are now subject to criminal charges. The human rights of these people have been trampled. Faced with the serious crisis in Ukraine, the authorities in Kyiv have made a number of good-will gestures. We welcome President Poroshenko’s decision to propose a 15-point peace plan and to declare a week-long ceasefire. We note with satisfaction that his proposed truce was accepted yesterday by the armed groups in the context of the three-way meetings held among Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE following the meetings in Normandy. We encourage that dialogue to continue and we call on the armed groups in eastern Ukraine to lay down their arms, leave all illegally occupied public buildings, and engage honestly and openly in a political dialogue that will allow them to make their claims in a legal and peaceful manner. In such conditions, everything possible must be done to promote a return to calm, which is a sine qua non for the start of a political dialogue. That, I repeat, entails control of the Russian-Ukrainian border in order to halt the infiltration of equipment and armed men. The international community as a whole and all members of the Council must strive towards that end and support Kyiv’s efforts. We welcome the declaration of the ceasefire enjoys the support of the Russian President. That support must be reflected on the ground at a time when there is cause for concern over word that wide-scale new military exercises are under way. In that light, we are heartened by the Russian President’s call on the Russian Federation Council this morning to annul its authorization for the Russian Army to intervene on Ukrainian territory. Today, there is no other path for Ukraine except that of unity and reconciliation. The European Union and France stand ready to offer Ukraine all their support in those efforts, as our Heads of State and Government recalled at their summit on 27 May.","In accordance with rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite the representative of Ukraine to participate in this meeting. In accordance with rule 39 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite the following briefers to participate in this meeting: Mr. Tayé-Brook Zerihoun, Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, and Mr. Ivan Šimonović, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights. On behalf of the Council, I welcome Mr. Šimonović, who is joining today’s meeting via video-teleconference from Zagreb. The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. I now give the floor to Mr. Zerihoun. I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the Russian Federation. I must note first and foremost that, yet again, during today’s discussions some members of the Security Council did not attempt to objectively evaluate the situation in Ukraine and its root causes. They made insinuations and even threats against Russia. We categorically refute them, and let us get to the heart of the matter now. For the first time in Ukraine, fragile encouraging signs have begun to appear. That President Poroshenko has declared a ceasefire is certainly important; there can be no negotiations without one. Most important, however, is that the ceasefire should lead to dialogue among all the warring parties in order to reach a compromise acceptable to all, so that people living in south-east Ukraine feel without a doubt that they are an integral part of the country, with all the rights of citizens of that State, and that those rights are guaranteed, including by the Constitution. We value the first consultations that were held in Donetsk between the authorities and official leaders of Ukraine and militias of south-east Ukraine, with the participation of the Russian Ambassador to Ukraine and the representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). We expect that the agreement to support the ceasefire will be strictly adhered to by the parties. Dialogue has begun, although the so-called Poroshenko plan did not originally include negotiations. Not surprisingly, the representatives of the east embraced him warily. They have no basis for trusting the Kyiv authorities. For our part, we are convinced that, without practical action and direct negotiations, the peace plan process will not be viable or realistic. In order to normalize and resolve the situation in the eastern regions of Ukraine, as well as with regard to the trilateral talks already launched on that matter, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a letter to the Council of the Federation of the Federal Assembly concerning the revocation of the Council’s decision on the use of the Russian Army on the territory of Ukraine, dated 1 March. From the outset, Russia has called for a political solution to the crisis in Ukraine through inclusive dialogue and swift constitutional reform. That was the goal of the Geneva statement of 17 April, as well as of the OSCE road map, which had our support along with that of many other States, but for some reason not that of Ukraine. We have repeatedly called for the relevant documents to be adopted by the Security Council, from short statements in support of the Geneva statement to resolutions that stress the importance of inclusive dialogue in resolving the humanitarian issues. Unfortunately, our initiatives are invariably met with stonewalling by Western colleagues. That may be because Kyiv did not adhere to many of the provisions of that document, even though they had made a commitment to refrain from violence, intimidation and provocation. Instead of halting its punitive operations against its own people, Kyiv actually intensified them. Kyiv has not moved to disarm illegally armed groups, particularly the co-called Right Sector and other extremists, along with various regional militias such as the Dnepr and Azov and the legally dubious National Guard. The Ukrainian crisis is strongly coloured by the fact that it is a direct consequence of the violent and unconstitutional change of Government in February. Residents of the south-east were treated with contempt by the self-proclaimed authorities. They copied the tactics of the Maidan and took up arms in order to declare their legal grievances, but then they were declared separatists and terrorists, and punitive operations were launched against entire cities with the use of heavy artillery and aviation. For a long time, even against the backdrop of President Poroshenko’s peace promises, those operations only gathered momentum, in both intensity and scope. Furthermore, the ceasefire was constantly violated. Shelling even reached Russian territory, as a result of which people were wounded and buildings were destroyed in the neighbourhood of the Dolzhansky Novoshahtinsk crossing point. The humanitarian situation remains extremely difficult, with an unabated flow of refugees to Russia. We are trubled by the refusal of the Ukrainian Ministry for Foreign Affairs to cooperate with us in that area. We call for the removal of artificial obstacles to the delivery of humanitarian supplies and for the establishment of safe corridors for the evacuation of civilians from combat zones. The corridors promised by President Poroshenko have yet to be created. Even under bullets, refugees continue to leave Ukraine. Upwards of 450,000 Ukrainian citizens have crossed the border and remain in Russia. The majority are living with friends and family, but in the border regions alone there are more than 220 temporary shelters, including tent cities. There are currently more than 19,000 people living in such accommodation, including more than 5,500 children. However, it is difficult for the central and southern districts to absorb such an influx, and new welcome centres are being established across Russia. Across the country, people are collecting humanitarian aid for the residents of south-east Ukraine. I will not hide the fact that we are deeply disturbed that some of our colleagues on the Council who are so prone to play the humanitarian card when they find it politically expedient seem indifferent in this case. With respect to the latest report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Ukraine, there is actually no reason for the Council to be discussing the report. The monitoring mission was established by the High Commissioner for Human Rights at the invitation of the Ukrainian authorities. Since the Security Council did not provide instructions for the report, logic would dictate that the report not be submitted to the Council. However, it is surprising that Kyiv, which itself invited the mission, is refusing to cooperate with it, particularly with respect to the investigation of the tragedy in Odesa. The report notes the lack of progress in OSCE’s parallel investigations, now numbering six, which simply shows the efforts being made to drown the truth in paper, and confirms the need for a comprehensive international investigation into the Odesa tragedy, as we have stated from the outset. As for the Russian Federation, we did not invite the mission and made no recommendations to it. We view the inclusion of the recommendations in the document as inappropriate. The human rights situation in Crimea should clearly not be the subject of the report. We also believe that the mission’s inability to provide an assessment under the pretext of a lack of access is nonsense. The consequences of Kyiv’s action to cut off water in Crimea are not mentioned in the report. However, the lack of access did not prevent the mission from making politically abhorrent statements on the deteriorating situation in Crimea. There are several politically motivated references in the report. According to the guidelines for drafting the report, it seems that only verified information should be used. That is probably correct but that limitation has always benefited Kyiv in the report. There are a number of references in the document to so-called reports of alleged human rights violations by armed groups in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. However, why are many details overlooked with regard to the residents of the area and journalists, as well as videos showing artillery strikes on residential areas in southeastern towns and casualties among civilians as a result of the indiscriminate use of force by the Government? The entire world saw the pictures of the Ukrainian air strikes on the Luhansk administrative building on 2 June, which could in no way be called a military target. Civilians were killed. Despite the fact that colleagues of the OSCE observers underscored that the strikes were carried out by surface-to-air rockets, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for some reason makes the absurd assumption that it was an unsuccessful attempt by militia to shoot down a Ukrainian plane. Such a statement has been rebutted by numerous sources. In the section on propaganda, the report overlooks the United Nations helicopter incident. For some reason the incident is not mentioned. However, in order to deal with the situation on the ground, we will have to determine the position with regard to the helicopters that had previously been provided to Ukraine for United Nations operations and if they had really been repainted. That should have been included and the relevant United Nations resources provided to that end. A separate discussion on the situation of journalists is required. The report notes that on 24 May, an Italian photojournalist, Andrea Rocchelli, and his colleague, Andrey Mironov, were killed. On 17 June, following mortar fire, the Russian journalists Igor Kornelyuk and Anton Voloshin were killed in Luhansk. There needs to be a careful investigation of those events. There are too many reports that indicate that it was a targeted attack. The detention, intimidation and beating of journalists continue. In addition to the cases in the report, we would note the 14 June incident, in which two correspondents of the Zvezda television channel were brutally beaten by the Ukrainian armed forces in order to obtain confessions. The Ukrainian authorities then boasted that the journalists had apologized for the reporting. There are continuing reports of journalists being persecuted for carrying out their work, as well as their expulsion from the country. In general, we must say that the report undermines trust in the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and gives rise to serious questions as to whether it is appropriate for the mission to continue its work. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. ","I would like to thank Assistant Secretary-General Zerihoun and Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for the briefings that we have just heard and for the detailed and thorough work being undertaken by the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine. Let me start with the positive. The United Kingdom strongly supports the peace plan set out by President Poroshenko on 20 June. That plan builds on earlier steps taken by the Government of Ukraine to implement the Geneva statement of 17 April. They include holding three rounds of national dialogue and submitting a draft law on amnesty for those who hand over illegal arms and who vacate illegally occupied buildings. The Government of Ukraine has also initiated constitutional reform and decentralization and has guaranteed protection and a special status for the Russian language. The peace plan constitutes a genuine and far-reaching set of proposals, which now create a major opportunity for de-escalation. Now is the moment for others to reciprocate. We welcome the fact that President Poroshenko’s peace plan has received at least a measure of support from Russia. President Putin has described the declaration of a ceasefire as without question an important step towards reaching a settlement and has said that Russia will certainly support those plans. We also note reports from Moscow that President Putin has asked the Russian Parliament to revoke the right of military intervention in Ukraine. Although we emphatically reject any suggestion that the decision by the Russian Parliament would confer any legitimacy on Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, it would send a positive signal that needs to be reinforced by positive actions. Russia must now back up those statements with actions to tackle instability in southern and eastern Ukraine. Those actions must include the following: first, adopting effective measures to prevent the continued flow of illegal fighters, arms and equipment from Russia into Ukraine; secondly, applying its influence over separatist groups to ensure that they renounce violence, lay down their arms and commit themselves to addressing their grievances through the peaceful and democratic mechanisms that are available to them; and, thirdly, continuing the withdrawal of troops from near the Ukrainian border. Russia has created facts on the ground through its direct support for armed separatist groups. It must now reverse the dynamics it has created, by preventing the flow of arms and fighters into Ukraine and using its influence over armed separatist groups so that they stop their illegal activities. If that does not happen, the countries of the European Union, including at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting yesterday, have reiterated their readiness to take further measures against Russia. I now come to the latest human rights monitoring report. The Ukrainian Government has engaged constructively with the mission, highlighting its commitment to transparency and to upholding the human rights of its citizens. It is disappointing that, once again, Russian Government sources have criticized the report and impugned the professionalism and integrity of the monitors and of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights as a whole. We encourage the Government of Ukraine to address concerns raised in the mission’s report of a lack of cooperation among the six different investigations into the tragic events of 2 May in Odessa, what Mr. Šimonović called “grave inaction” just now. We also urge the Government to ensure the security of all diplomatic missions. We condemn unreservedly the attack against the Russian Embassy in Kyiv on 14 June. Establishing confidence in the rule of law in Ukraine is essential. The United Kingdom, together with our partners, is ready to support the Ukrainian Government as they tackle reforms in those areas. The mission’s latest report highlights the role played by illegal armed groups in Donetsk and Luhansk in preventing many voters in those regions from participating in the presidential elections of 25 May. The separatist tactics of threatening, beating and abducting staff of the Electoral Commission, destroying voter lists and ballot boxes and seizing control of polling stations demonstrate a contempt for democracy and a determination to prevent the people of those regions from having a voice in the future of Ukraine. As the latest report underlines, the actions of illegal armed groups have led to a deterioration in the human rights situation in Donetsk and Luhansk. Having violently seized control, those groups are failing to provide public services and are damaging vital infrastructure. We are deeply disturbed by the mission’s findings of abductions, detentions, ill treatment, torture, looting and killings being carried out by those groups against the broader civilian population. The monitoring mission has reported 222 cases of abductions and detentions by illegal armed groups. They have also recorded numerous allegations of ill treatment and torture, starvation of prisoners, beatings, electric shocks and even amputation, which are all reportedly being used by pro-Russian groups. It is no surprise that the mission’s report concludes that areas under separatist control are characterized by an atmosphere of fear and intimidation. The monitoring mission’s report cites compelling evidence of the use of propaganda and misinformation to generate a climate of fear and instability in Ukraine. That includes the use by the Russian media of doctored photographs and re-purposed film footage. The report notes, for example, the footage used to substantiate claims that Ukraine was using United Nations markedhelicopters, a claim also made in the Chamber by the Russian Federation, was in fact filmed in other countries at an earlier date. For example, a photograph of such a helicopter presented by Russia as evidence to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) was in fact taken in 2011 in Côte d’Ivoire. There are numerous other examples of misinformation, including footage claiming to show incendiary weapons being used by the Ukrainian military, which was in fact filmed in November 2004 in Iraq. On one occasion recently, the Russian Permanent Representative urged us all to follow the Russian media for an accurate picture of what is going on in Ukraine. On the evidence of this report, I think that most of us would beg to differ with that. The mission’s latest report also confirms that in Crimea the introduction of Russian legislation is undermining Ukrainian citizens’ enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Pro-Ukrainians are being targeted and intimidated with increasing discrimination, especially in the areas of education and employment. We underline that the United Kingdom will not recognize or accept Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea. Over a succession of Council meetings, we have seen a deterioration of the security situation in parts of Ukraine caused by illegal armed separatist groups. We have seen growing evidence of human rights abuses, in large part because of the actions of those armed groups, and we have witnessed a growing humanitarian challenge. The peace plan put forward by President Poroshenko provides an opportunity to break out of that downward spiral. Yesterday’s OSCE-brokered talks in Donetsk seem to have given positive momentum to that. The United Kingdom urges the Council to give strong and united support to that plan. It urges the Ukrainian Government to press forward purposefully with its implementation, and it urges the Russian Federation to follow up on its positive statements with positive actions that will cut off political and practical support to armed separatist groups and allow a process of dialogue and democratic engagement to take root.","Time and again — at least 17 times since February — we have gathered here to discuss the situation in Ukraine. And time and again, we have had to dedicate significant amounts of time to reviewing the efforts of Russia to destabilize its neighbour and to refuting the bald misinformation and outright fiction about what is happening on the ground in Ukraine. Russian rhetoric has been inaccurate, inflammatory and self-justifying. On 17 June, just last week, Foreign Minister Lavrov accused Ukrainian military authorities of carrying out ethnic cleaning. Days earlier, a leader in the Duma accused Ukraine of committing mass genocide. My Government, the Security Council and the United Nations take extremely seriously any reports of ethnic cleaning or genocide. But baseless claims like those have the effect of radicalizing Russian separatists, escalating this horrible crisis and further eviscerating the credibility of Russian reports from the region. We should consider such claims alongside the facts on the ground, such as the situation of the ethnic Tatar community in Crimea following Russia’s purported annexation, which the international community will never recognize. The homes of Tatar leaders have been arbitrarily searched and editors of their main newspaper have been threatened with prosecution. Tatars who have participated in peaceful protests have been locked up by the dozens, and many more insulted and harassed for speaking their language in public. And its members have been told that they and all Crimeans must give up their Ukrainian citizenship or else be treated like foreigners in their own land. Meanwhile, in areas controlled by illegal separatist groups in south-east Ukraine, we continue to see Russia’s extensive support for the campaign of violence and separatist terror. The crimes committed by those groups are methodically documented in the United Nations monitoring mission’s reports and follow a pattern set by Russia’s unlawful intervention in Crimea. They include the violent seizure and occupation of public and Government buildings, unprovoked lethal attacks against Ukrainian security forces and arbitrary arrests, torture, beatings, death threats, disappearances, killings and other serious abuses carried out by Russian fighters and the pro-Russian separatists. We do not need to look very far or hard to find evidence of that campaign. We see it in the three T-64 Russian tanks that suddenly showed up in the hands of separatists in eastern Ukraine. We see it in the burned out BM-21 rocket launcher, one of many that suddenly appeared in eastern Ukraine in the past weeks, which photographs show recently belonged to Russia’s eighteenth motorized rifle brigade, based in Chechnya. We see it in surface-to-air missiles that were recently seized by Ukrainian forces after a clash with separatists; they were still accompanied by their official paperwork, revealing that as recently as two months ago those missiles were held on a Russian air-defence base in the Krasnodar region. Those are just the type of surface-to-air missiles, I would note, that were used to bring down a Ukrainian military transport plane last week, killing all 49 people on board. And we see it in the alarming redeployment of thousands of Russian troops and military hardware along the border with Ukraine, at the closest proximity since the invasion of Crimea in February. Russia has attempted — erroneously — to characterize the events unfolding in eastern Ukraine as a humanitarian crisis. They falsely have cast themselves as the defender of rights and vindicator of the vulnerable, and the Russian army and its operatives as a humanitarian aid agency. But this Russian aid operation sends soldiers, not doctors. It mans armoured personnel carriers, not relief tents. It provides surface-to-air missiles, not meals ready-to-eat. Russia claims that 100,000 people have fled Ukraine for Russia. Yet Under-Secretary-General Amos informed the Council in a briefing last week that the real number was around 4,600. I do not for one moment intend to minimize the very real humanitarian consequences of the crises in eastern Ukraine and Crimea, including the tens of thousands of internally displaced people within Ukraine’s borders. But we have to be objective and fact-based in our claims, and candid about what has brought about these dire humanitarian consequences, namely, the political and military support that Russia continues to provide to armed violent separatists. Yet, remarkably, even in the face of separatist attacks and inflammatory propaganda, the Ukrainian Government and Ukrainian people have shown in word and in deed a sustained willingness to work towards a peaceful solution. The Ukrainian people elected a leader, Petro Poroshenko, who campaigned on creating a democratic, unified and peaceful Ukraine. Since taking office, President Poroshenko has persistently sought to achieve that goal through dialogue and reconciliation, even in the face of provocations and violence. He proposed, and then implemented, a unilateral ceasefire to allow separatists to lay down their arms. He offered to create a safe passage for Russian fighters to return to their country. And he proposed amnesty to Russian-backed separatists who had not committed serious crimes. We welcome yesterday’s reports that representatives of the Ukrainian and Russian Governments and separatists groups met together, leading to an announcement by some separatist leaders that they would respect the ceasefire. President Poroshenko and his Government have taken steps to decentralize power, increase transparency, combat corruption and protect the rights of minorities. And he has put on the table a comprehensive and just peace plan. In sum, he and the Ukrainian people have done everything that could be expected, in an effort to make peace in accordance with international law and norms. Over the last few days, we have seen more contradictory behaviour on the part of Russia. On the one hand, President Putin expresses his support for President Poroshenko’s ceasefire and his intention to work towards a peaceful settlement. That is a welcome development. Yet, on the other hand, Russia has recently returned a significant number of its troops to the border and has ramped up the flow of weapons and materiel to separatists, an increasing number of whom are Russian citizens with no personal connection to eastern Ukraine. President Putin has also placed Russian troops on combat alert and launched a new surprise military exercise. President Putin’s recent statements are welcome. But it is hard to take a little rhetoric of reconciliation seriously when it is accompanied by actions that are clearly aimed at stoking tension. It is even harder to take seriously given that Russia’s track record of repeatedly breaking its commitments to dialogue and to peace, as it did after the Geneva statement in April and after the pledges that President Putin made to President Obama in Normandy earlier this month. While we welcome the more conciliatory rhetoric from President Putin in recent days, those words now need to be reflected in a genuine shift in the facts on the ground. Those facts are best gathered by unbiased reporting, like that conducted by international monitoring missions. But the Russians and the armed separatists that they support do not seem comfortable with facts or with monitors. As we sit here, eight monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe are being held captive for the crime of bearing witness and gathering facts, actions that are dangerous only to those who would distort those facts. The monitors have been held captive for nearly a month — a month — by separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk, with no justification. For these crimes there must be consequences. There also must be continued consequences for Russia’s consistent violations of the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for its ongoing failure to meet the commitments it has made. And there must be consequences for the widespread crimes and abuses committed by the armed separatists Russia supports — both because the victims of those crimes merit justice and because, as we have seen, unless Russia feels effective pressure to de-escalate, it will continue to choose to escalate the crisis. We have urged Russia to be part of the political solution to the crisis in Ukraine. But, if it persists with the same escalatory tactics, it must face additional costs.",,,,,,,,,,,"It is of great importance that the Security Council is having a meeting on the current situation in Ukraine. I would like to thank all members of the Security Council for their statements. I am grateful for their support of our President’s plan for the peaceful settlement of the situation in eastern Ukraine.
We thank Assistant Secretary-General Tayé-Brook Zerihoun for his briefing. We welcome the report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, presented by Assistant Secretary-General Mr. Šimonović, who has travelled to Ukraine many times. The report contains conclusions and recommendations that are important to the Government of Ukraine and highly valuable to our country. Ukraine is ready to further develop and deepen cooperation with the United Nations human rights bodies. We welcome the decision to extend the United Nations human rights monitoring mission mandate for another term.
The report notes the continuation of the worrying trends in Crimea, including instances of enforced disappearances, detentions, violence and ill treatment by illegal paramilitary groups, or the so-called Crimean self-defence, often targeting journalists, human rights defenders and political opponents. It also notes impunity for human rights violations. The judicial system remains practically paralysed. Crimean residents face serious difficulties in exercising their civil and political rights. Following threats, many Crimeans have been forced to give up Ukrainian citizenship. There are only two Ukrainian schools in Crimea, one of which has already been compelled to become Russian and its director forced to resign. Today, we learned that unknown armed men have occupied a madrasa, or Muslim religious school, near Simferopol.
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the officially confirmed number of internally displaced persons from Crimea, Ukraine, is more than 12,000, who have been forced to leave the peninsula due to the unbearable living conditions created by the occupying authorities. That is truly alarming. We demand that the Russian Federation, which has temporarily occupied the Crimean peninsula, ensure the protection of the rights of Ukrainian citizens of all nationalities who remain in Crimea, that is, Ukrainians, Russians, Crimean Tatars and others, including their right to freedom and to security and the rights of religious communities.
Given the ongoing systematic violations of human rights in Crimea, the Ukrainian side hopes that the situation on the peninsula shall continue to receive the attention of the international community. It supports the report’s call on the occupying authorities in the Crimea to provide access for independent international experts, primarily the United Nations monitoring mission.
The report, inter alia, contains updates on the information regarding the tragic events in Odesa. It is significant that the efforts of the Ukrainian authorities to investigate both the tragic Maidan events and those of 2 May in Odesa have been acknowledged in the report. The assistance that the law enforcement bodies provided to the mission and their observance of the proper respect for the rights of those arrested in Odesa are noted with appreciation. We thank the human rights monitoring group for the objective approach to the assessment of the events. As of the present moment, several suspects have been arrested. State criminal experts were able to establish the cause of death of the victims. The investigation continues and the official results will be made public as soon as they have been established.
In the report, special attention is paid to the situation in the eastern regions of Ukraine. The document notes the growing number of illegal actions committed by highly organized illegal armed groups in violation of national and international laws. It is very important to mention that human rights violations and humanitarian problems occur only in those cities that are temporarily under the control of illegal armed groups, such as Slovyansk, Kramatorsk and Snizhne. The illegal activities of those groups include murder, torture, the seizure of administrative and public buildings, the kidnapping and detention of civilians, including journalists, taking hostages, including observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and intimidating and terrorizing the local population. The groups are capturing infrastructure management buildings, causing disruption to the operation of some water and electricity supply facilities that have suffered gunfire. Terrorists are deliberately waging a war against civilians, creating barriers to the free movement of people, including disabled persons. Such people are cynically used as live shields. We express our deepest condolences over the deaths of the foreign journalists, Italian and Russian, who became victims of the fighting.
From the very beginning, I would like to stress that there is no humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. The humanitarian problems in some parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions are caused only by the activities of pro-Russian illegal armed groups that have managed to seize control of the cities. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Government is doing its utmost to exercise control over the situation, to restore law and order and to provide help for all our citizens. The President of Ukraine ordered the establishment of all necessary conditions for the civilian population willing to leave cities temporarily seized by terrorists through safe corridors.
The State emergency services were assigned to establish a multifunctional coordination centre in order to transport affected persons, as well as to maintain the health-care and social needs of the civilians. The local authorities of other regions of Ukraine ensure the accommodation of people arriving from the area who have suffered terrorist attacks. The National Coordination Centre is assisting in the temporary accommodation of the citizens of Ukraine who are moving from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions to other regions of the country. Special attention has been given to the relocation of children who are being sent to and accommodated at summer camps in all regions of the country.
The Ukrainian Government is demonstrating its ability to bring peace to people. The authorities of liberated cities like Mariupol and others are now able to deliver the message of peace to other cities, whose populations are still influenced by false messages containing anti-Ukrainian propaganda. As a practical step, the President of Ukraine, Mr. Petro Poroshenko, held a large, inclusive meeting-dialogue last week with the true representatives of the eastern region of the country — representatives of local communities and of the business and political elite of Donetsk and Luhansk and legitimately elected mayors.
In his inaugural speech on 7 June, President Poroshenko stressed that he was assuming the office in order to preserve the sovereignty, territorial integrity and national unity of Ukraine, ensure sustainable peace and guarantee security for all citizens. Last Friday, President Poroshenko presented his plan for the peaceful settlement of the situation in the eastern regions of Ukraine, which I assume the Security Council supports. Council members will have noticed that the plan includes three major parts: ceasefire, restoration and dialogue.
President Poroshenko has already initiated the implementation of the plan by ordering a unilateral ceasefire in the east of Ukraine. I would now like to quote from the speech with which my President addressed the nation last Sunday and in which he explained the details of the plan.
“The immediate implementation of the peace plan will open the path to political dialogue. I invite legally elected representatives of local Government, non-governmental organizations and everyone else to join in the dialogue. Diametrically opposed views will not be a barrier to participation in the negotiations. I am ready to talk with those who have erred or who mistakenly took a position in support of separatism, but not, of course, people who were involved in acts of terrorism, murder or torture. Moreover, I guarantee safety for all participants in the negotiations, for anyone who wants to speak the language of argument instead of the language of weapons.“It is important to state that the issue of the territorial integrity of Ukraine is not on the table. We hear and take into account the specific opinions of Donbas citizens, but we cannot and will not transform Ukraine, where there is a large consensus on the issues of unity, territorial structure, language and geopolitical orientation, to satisfy them.“What then is the way out of this situation? It is in a broad decentralization of power. Decentralization provides for the expansion of the rights of regions on issues of historical memory, cultural traditions and language policy. Those issues will never again divide the country. Local communities in Donbas will have the right to freely use the Russian language along with the State language.”
The plan has been supported by major world leaders and international organizations — the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the United Nations. Ukraine is committed to strictly following a path of building peace. In response to the peace-restoring initiative, the gunmen and terrorists launched continued armed attacks, blatantly violating the truce terms.
We welcome the intention of the Russian President to cancel of Federation Council decision on the use of armed forces on the territory of Ukraine. However, in areas of the Russian Federation adjacent to the border with Ukraine, a notable increase in the concentration of manpower and military equipment of the Russian Federation’s armed forces has been witnessed in recent days.
Ukraine calls on all international partners to support our sustained efforts to restore peace and the unconditional implementation by all sides of the 17 April Geneva statement. We have asked the international community to support President Poroshenko’s plan for the peaceful settlement of the situation in the eastern part of Ukraine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I would like to thank Assistant Secretaries-General Ivan Šimonović and Tayé-Brook Zerihoun for their briefings. President Poroshenko’s peace plan offers a fragile hope for a solution to this artificially induced crisis, which has been stoked by Russia’s persistent anti-Ukrainian propaganda as well as a continuous influx of militants and weaponry from across Ukraine’s Russian borders. A return to normality is badly needed after the months of destruction and lawlessness perpetrated by illegal armed separatists, which have led to a disturbing deterioration of human rights and the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine, as the third report of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission testifies.
The report is yet more proof that a pro-Russian militant insurgency has been the cause, and not the effect, of the serious human rights violations and a breakdown of law and order in the eastern regions of Ukraine, just as Russia’s occupation of Crimea was the cause, and not the effect, of serious human and minority rights violations in that region. The report details cases of abductions, unlawful detentions, killings, torture, ill-treatment, forced disappearances, intimidation and harassment perpetrated by the armed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Criminality and looting have increased considerably in areas held by the militant separatists. Stalinist-style arbitrary executions by the insurgents have also been recorded, including within their own ranks or as revenge on those giving support to Government forces. One such case mentioned in the report is the execution of a farmer in front of his family for bringing food to Ukrainian forces.
The separatists have been carrying out increasingly brazen attacks using ever more sophisticated weapons. They possess anti-aircraft and anti-tank weaponry, automatic assault rifles, man-portable air defence systems and other arms. Last week, three T-64 tanks, BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launchers and other military vehicles crossed illegally from Russia into Ukrainian territory and were seen in the towns of Snizhne, Torez and Makiyivka. On 14 June, in a criminal act they readily admitted to, militants downed a Ukrainian military transport plane, leading to 49 deaths. Only a few minutes ago, while we were speaking in the Council, a military helicopter was again downed by the separatists, resulting in nine more deaths. We offer our sympathy to all those who have lost their loved ones and have been affected by the displacement, deprivation, intimidation and threats produced by this crisis.
We reiterate our long-standing position that Ukraine has a right and a duty to defend itself and to seek to restore law and order within its borders. Legitimate force must be used with due restraint, avoiding unnecessary damage to civilian infrastructure and civilian casualties. The best way to defeat the deadly mix of violence, hate and lawlessness that drives the pro-Russian insurgency is by upholding legality and the rule of law.
Mr. Šimonović’s third report contains a number of recommendations to the Ukrainian Government. Lithuania and all the members of the European Union stand ready to assist Ukraine in reforming the security sector, the police and the rule of law. We welcome the steps that the Government of Ukraine has taken so far in implementing the 17 April Geneva statement, through a number of round tables, initiatives and legislative changes, including those aimed at decentralizing power. Other important legislative measures are in the process of being enacted, and Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović spoke about that at length. The Ukrainian Government has repeatedly offered to grant amnesty to those who lay down their arms. Just a few days ago, President Poroshenko went to eastern Ukraine to directly engage with the local population and authorities.
Welcome steps have also been taken to ensure the rights of ethnic minorities. In stark contrast to the situation in occupied Crimea, where the teaching of the Ukrainian and Tatar languages is being squeezed out, on 30 May Kyiv amended the framework curriculum to improve the teaching of minority languages as diverse as Armenian, Bulgarian, Tatar, Gagauz, Greek, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Korean, Moldovan, Polish, Romanian, Russian and Slovak.
President Poroshenko’s most recent initiative, a 15-step plan for a peaceful settlement of the situation in eastern Ukraine, which my country fully endorses, could be a real game-changer. While it was unfortunately greeted by more insurgent attacks, trilateral talks are taking place, and there has been some movement on exchanging prisoners and restoring public utility services.
The Ukrainian Government is doing its part to realize the peace agreement. The onus is now on the separatists and on Russia to do theirs. We note the fact that on Wednesday Russia’s Federation Council is to revoke a resolution authorizing the use of Russian armed forces on Ukrainian territory, and we hope that implies all of Ukrainian territory. More, however, must be done. Russia has yet to clearly dissociate itself from the militant separatism in eastern Ukraine or to call on all the insurgents to lay down the arms. It has not yet ensured proper control of its borders with Ukraine or put an end to the flow into eastern Ukraine of Russian-made weaponry and mercenaries, as well as foreign fighters.
Importantly, Russia has yet to end the incendiary campaign against Ukraine that has been stoking militant insurgency in the eastern part of the country. Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable and must be respected by all. We reiterate our condemnation of the occupation of Crimea and stress that a forced redrawing of internationally recognized borders has no place in the twenty-first century.
Lithuania appreciates the work being done by the United Nations human rights monitoring mission and the special monitoring mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to provide regular updates on the situation in Ukraine. We welcome the Ukrainian Government’s invitation to allow the extension of the United Nations mission for three more months. As noted by previous speakers, impartial reporting on human rights violations and developments on the ground is key to ensuring that facts are not manipulated.
Ukraine’s continued openness to international monitoring shows its constructive spirit and stands in stark contrast to the actions of the separatists, who have done all they can to prevent reporting from the areas they hold captive. Let us not forget that they are still holding eight OSCE observers. We call for their immediate release and that of all the hostages in separatist hands. The Ukrainian peace plan offers a potential breakthrough for the restoration of peace and stability in line with the international principles of respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine. We hope that all the parties will seize this opportunity, although the events of a few minutes ago raise legitimate doubts as to the separatists’ commitment to it. ","I thank the briefers for their updates on political developments and the human rights situation in Ukraine. On political developments, we are pleased to note that, after months of conflict and escalating tensions, the people of Ukraine now have an opportunity to peacefully resolve the crisis that has destabilized their country.
We have carefully studied Petro Poroshenko’s 15-point peace plan. We see it as the best way forward in the current circumstances to address the various issues that led to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. We urge the people of Ukraine and the international community to support the plan. Of particular significance in the plan are the week-long ceasefire, steps to decentralize power, the protection of the Russian language and constitutional reform.
We welcome the support of Russian President Vladimir Putin for the ceasefire. We believe that it has played a role in the decision of the pro-Russian separatists to respect the ceasefire. We see it as a positive development that raises hopes for an end to the fighting that has caused substantial damage to property, left hundreds dead or wounded, displaced hundreds of thousands of people and disrupted livelihoods. We are pleased to note that the ceasefire is holding, as the Government has announced that there has been no fighting in eastern Ukraine since yesterday.
We take positive note of the promise of the rebels to release the observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) who have been held hostage since May. That is a significant development. According to news reports, a representative of the rebels at the negotiations held yesterday in Donetsk, in line with President Poroshenko’s peace plan, stated that the release of the OSCE observers would “be one of the steps that will improve mutual understanding on both sides”. We would like to see the OSCE observers released unconditionally and without delay.
All things considered, the prospects for a peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis have been enhanced. We hope that the people of Ukraine will build on the momentum and goodwill generated by President Poroshenko’s peace plan. We have consistently advocated dialogue as the way to resolve the crisis in Ukraine, and we are pleased to see that happening now.
On human rights, we have carefully examined the third report of the human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, which covers the period of 7 May to 7 June. We note that the reporting period precedes the peace plan of President Poroshenko. The report links the deterioration of the human rights situation in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. We condemn all violations of human rights, including abductions, torture, forced disappearances and illegal detentions. We would like to see the perpetrators brought to justice in order to send a strong message that impunity will not be tolerated. It is our hope that with the current ceasefire and eventual cessation of hostilities the human rights situation in eastern Ukraine will begin to improve.
In conclusion, we would like to stress the need for all concerned to respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine, in line with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. ","At the outset, I should like to thank Mr. Šimonović and Mr. Zerihoun for their briefings this morning. We have taken note of the conclusions and recommendations contained in the third report, dated 15 June, of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, based on the findings of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine.
My delegation expresses its deep concern over the worsening situation in eastern Ukraine, and particularly in Donetsk and Luhansk, following the proliferation of weapons and a rise in the number of armed elements, which have in turn increased the number of kidnappings, incidents of forced detention and torture, and crime in that region. It has also led to a rise in the number of messages of hatred and media propaganda campaigns fabricated by those groups. Jordan therefore reiterates its condemnation of all those acts, as well as its invitation to all those with influence in Ukraine to strive to de-escalate the situation and to reach a solution that can re-establish stability in eastern Ukraine and thereby guarantee the return of internally displaced persons to their homes and to avert a negative socioeconomic impact in Ukraine.
Jordan welcomes the progress achieved by the Ukrainian Government in implementing the recommendations contained in the two previous reports. We appeal to the Government to continue to accelerate its efforts in order to implement all the recommendations contained in the last report. We also welcome the commitment of the Ukrainian authorities to implementing the points of the Geneva statement of 17 April. We reiterate the need to respect international norms in all operations that may be launched to re-establish the State’s authority throughout Ukrainian territory.
The democratic election of a new President in Ukraine last month represents a ray of hope for the Ukrainian people. Jordan pays tribute to the steps that President Poroshenko is beginning to take in order to ensure a return to stability in his country, starting with the visit he made to the regions of the east of Ukraine and his proposal for a peace plan that would put an end to the revolt in the east. The President has also proposed a general amnesty to separatists who elect to surrender their weapons, as well as to open safe corridors so that they can leave Ukraine. He is also continuing to work to promote the rights of minorities and communities that are not Ukrainian speakers. Those are all signs of good will on the part of the Ukrainian authorities that enhance the chances of achieving a peaceful solution to the crisis.
In conclusion, we appeal to the international community and the United Nations to combine their efforts to ensure the success of the peace plan and to continue with mediation and good offices in order to end the crisis and bring about a return to stability in Ukraine.","We welcome the briefings by Assistant Secretaries-General Šimonović and Zerihoun and express our appreciation for the efforts that the Secretary-General continues to make to bring the situation in Ukraine to an end.
The recent report of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine continues to generate concern for our country with respect to the human rights situation in eastern and southern Ukraine, in particular in Donetsk and Luhansk. My delegation is particularly concerned by the alarming increase in human rights violations and abuses, which have primarily affected journalists, politicians and activists. We deeply deplore the deaths of two Russian journalists and an Italian journalist in Luhansk last week.
The increase in violations of the right to life, liberty and security that now affect civilians in those regions, as manifested in the attacks, kidnappings, torture and harassment taking place, highlight the need to restore the rule of law and respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, General Assembly resolution 68/262 and international law. We also reiterate our concern about the situation of internally displaced persons in Ukraine, which, according to the report, now total over 12,700 people, primarily women and children. That is a clear sign of the severity of the crisis.
Chile would like to acknowledge the efforts of the Ukrainian Government to put an end to the situation in the country and highlights the peace plan and the unilateral ceasefire recently announced by President Poroshenko. The announcement by separatist groups that they would comply with the ceasefire is an encouraging sign and should be reflected in their actions on the ground. Of equal importance are the proposed constitutional amendments in the Memorandum of concord and peace, which was drafted during the round table on national unity and adopted on 20 May by the Ukrainian Parliament, which are aimed at determining Ukraine’s future in a democratic, transparent and inclusive manner.
We urge the parties to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis through direct political dialogue, exercise restraint, refrain from unilateral actions that could exacerbate tensions and participate in international mediation efforts such as the trilateral contact group, which includes Ukraine, Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the Geneva agreement of 17 April. Similarly, we call for full respect for the rule of law, democracy and human rights in Ukraine, including the rights of all minorities.
The Government of Ukraine has the responsibility to maintain public order throughout the territory, in conformity with its constitutional norms and domestic legislation and with full respect for the rights and safeguards of all people in Ukraine. The monopoly of the use of force that the Government of Ukraine enjoys in its own territory, as is the case for any Government in the international community, should be exercised with full respect for human rights and in proportion to the situation at hand.
Chile reiterates its support for the appeal made by Mr. Šimonović for ensuring accountability with regard to violations and abuses of human rights in Ukraine, including the 222 cases of illegal detention, of the disappearance of 81 persons, and the deaths of more than 400 people in the east, including children, members of the armed forces and armed groups. It is equally essential that the authorities continue to investigate and finally bring to justice those who were responsible for the death of 48 persons in Odesa on 2 May, and that they look into why the security forces did not take more timely and decisive steps to prevent that tragedy.
We reiterate our support for the work of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine and with the monitoring mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. We are confident that those independent international mechanisms will continue to contribute to achieving a solution to the crisis. ","I would like to thank Mr. Zerihoun, Assistant Secretary-General of Department for Political Affairs, and Mr. Šimonović, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, for their briefings.
The report on Ukraine issued by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights covering the period 7 May to 7 June, unfortunately confirms the worsening of the human rights situation in that country, in particular in the south-east. Chad notes with concern that well-trained and -equipped armed groups are gaining strength and continue to occupy the majority of public and administrative buildings in many cities and communities, in particular in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. We also note an increase in the number of kidnappings, detentions, ill treatment, torture, killings and even summary executions by armed groups. The attacks of those groups are no longer just targeting journalists, elected or local officials or civil society activists, but are directly impacting civilians.
We condemn the abduction and detention of eight monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and we demand their immediate and unconditional release.
As the fighting intensifies, civilians are increasingly caught in the crossfire between the armed groups and the Ukrainian military. That results in a growing number of civilians killed and wounded, in particular women and children. Chad calls on all the parties involved to act with calm and restraint and urges countries with influence on them to help them make dialogue and reconciliation between Ukrainians a priority.
Given the environment of insecurity related to social and economic hardship, civilians are fleeing the areas of conflict. There are already more than 15,000 internally displaced persons, 64 per cent of whom are women and children, in particular in the east. Chad calls upon those involved in the fighting to facilitate access for humanitarian organizations to areas affected by military operations so that people’s needs may be evaluated and taken into account.
The crisis in Ukraine is an ongoing threat to the freedom of expression. Many journalists have been killed, kidnapped, tortured or prosecuted. Hate speech on social networks continues to fuel tensions and widen the divisions between communities. In that regard, Chad calls upon all stakeholders to refrain from spreading messages of intolerance that incite discrimination, hatred or violence.
In spite of the bleak human rights situation in Ukraine, Chad is pleased with the new Government’s efforts to restore public order, re-establish political dialogue and stabilize the country. In upholding Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity, Chad supports and encourages the implementation of the plan to peaceably resolve the situation, led by President Petro Poroshenko, and in particular the Government’s unilateral decision to institute a ceasefire in the east of Ukraine from 20 to 27 June.
We also welcome the Ukrainian Parliament’s vote on the resolution on the memorandum of understanding and peace that provides for a package of constitutional reforms of areas that include the decentralization of power, special status for the Russian language, reform of the judicial and police systems and enactment of an amnesty for participants in the anti-Government demonstrations in the East who agree to lay down their arms. Chad urges that the judiciary in Ukraine guarantee the victims’ rights and commits to investigating those responsible for violating human rights, including the perpetrators of the events linked to the Maidan Square demonstrations, the murders that took place in January and February and the incidents on 2 May in Odesa. In our view, the underlying causes of the crisis in Ukraine are structural ones, and if the country is to emerge from crisis its solutions must include those that take those realities into account. If they are to succeed, reconciliation and development among the country’s communities must be achieved by peaceful and democratic means, with respect and guarantees for human rights for all. In order to deal with these challenges and to those linked to its territorial integrity, sovereignty and stability, Ukraine needs the support of the entire international community. ","I would like to thank Assistant Secretaries-General Zerihoun and Šimonović for their briefings this morning.
Australia welcomes President Poroshenko’s peace plan as a major opportunity for de-escalating the situation in Ukraine. We also welcome Ukraine’s declaration of a unilateral ceasefire and the apparent support for it from separatist leaders. The peace plan, with its call for dialogue with legally elected authorities in the east, security guarantees for all parties who participate in negotiations, the release of hostages and further efforts to decentralize power, including through local elections, presents a welcome chance for addressing grievances and ending the crisis. Those are courageous initiatives and should have our support.
We urge separatists in eastern Ukraine to adhere to — and not take advantage of — the ceasefire. Reports of separatist attacks against Ukrainian border posts after the ceasefire’s declaration must be condemned. Reports received in the last half an hour of a Ukrainian helicopter being shot down near Slovyansk, with nine dead, are a very bad development. Commitments to adhere to the ceasefire must be upheld. Australia understands that Ukraine’s armed forces will use force to defend themselves if attacked. They have the right to do so. Of course, the Ukrainian Government must continue to ensure that any operations conducted by its armed forces are in line with international standards.
There are disturbing reports of the continued flow of illegal fighters, arms and other military equipment, including heavy weapons such as tanks, across the Russian border into Ukraine. The Council should not tolerate those continued and destabilizing violations of Ukraine’s sovereignty. It is essential that Russia exercise control of its borders. We are also concerned by reports that Russia has again redeployed thousands of troops near the Ukrainian border in what appears to be a further calculated provocation. All those actions have been destabilizing eastern Ukraine. We again urge Russia to pull its troops back from the border, prevent the flow of illegal arms and fighters into Ukraine and call publicly for separatists in Ukraine to renounce violence. More positively, we welcome President Putin’s request to the Russian Duma today to repeal the resolution that purported to sanction Russia’s use of force in Ukraine. No such use of force is legal or legitimate, but, if carried out, Putin’s move to repeal it constitutes at least a signal of movement towards de-escalation. We also welcome the Secretary-General’s continued engagement with the situation and the United Nations commitment to work with Ukrainian authorities to assist with internally displaced persons.
The third report of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine presents a damning picture of the consequences of violent separatism in eastern Ukraine. The majority of human rights abuses are occurring in Donetsk and Luhansk, where separatist groups are active. In other areas of Ukraine, under Government control, concerted efforts are being made to ensure human rights are respected. The report commends Ukraine’s own efforts to address grievances and build a society that respects the rule of law.
Ukraine has addressed constitutional reform, with a focus on the decentralization of power; announced parliamentary elections for later this year; worked to reform law enforcement bodies and taken steps to fight corruption. Ukrainian authorities have begun to investigate the Maidan protests and the 2 May Odesa incident. Timely accountability is crucial, so it is important that those investigations progress quickly.
In contrast to those positive steps, the situation in eastern Ukraine continues to deteriorate. The aggressive actions of separatist groups are having a negative impact on the human rights situation in areas of Ukraine under their control. As the report states, “with the demise of security, the rule of law and governance, the protection gap is widening”. Civilians have been killed by armed groups. Abductions and detentions now affect the broader population in Donetsk and Luhansk, who live in a climate of fear and intimidation. We are affronted at the ongoing detention of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe monitors in eastern Ukraine, and we call again for their immediate release. Journalists in eastern Ukraine face attacks, abductions and detentions. Five have been killed during the crisis. We welcome the Council’s press statement on the killing of journalists in eastern Ukraine. In a situation where misinformation abounds, it is critical that journalists be able to report freely and without fear.
Violence in the east, as we know, has disrupted social services. Schools have closed, hospitals are overcrowded and understaffed, running water and electricity are scarce in some areas, and food prices have increased rapidly. It is clearly increasingly difficult for civilians in eastern Ukraine to lead normal lives, but we note also the United Nations assessment that the situation in eastern Ukraine, unacceptable as it is, does not constitute a humanitarian crisis. The risk, of course, is that it could worsen and become a humanitarian crisis if armed separatists do not desist and if Russian assistance to them does not stop.
I should note that the human rights situation in Crimea has deteriorated markedly since Russia’s illegal annexation of the peninsula. Freedom of assembly and religious belief are under threat. There are reports that some Crimean residents have been forced to surrender their Ukrainian citizenship. It is disturbing that only a small number of Crimeans were able to vote in Ukraine’s presidential elections and had to do so by travelling to mainland Ukraine.
The report makes useful proposals for the way ahead, which deserve our support. Crucially, it emphasizes that all armed groups must immediately put an end to their violent activities and lay down their arms. President Poroshenko’s peace plan and ceasefire provide the opportunity to do that — to end separatist violence — and all parties should seize this opportunity. A failure to resolve the situation by peaceful means will destroy the lives and livelihoods of even more Ukrainians. None of us in the Council should allow that to happen. ",,,,"Mr. President, I thank you for convening this meeting. Let me also thank Assistant Secretaries-General Tayé-Brook Zerihoun and Ivan Šimonović for their respective briefings on the political and human rights situations in Ukraine. We commend the Secretary-General for his good offices and for his unwavering efforts to find a lasting political and diplomatic solution to the Ukrainian crisis.
As we meet today, we are encouraged by several steps taken by the parties in the region to de-escalate the situation. Rwanda supports the 15-step plan of President Petro Poroshenko to end the crisis and welcomes the unilateral ceasefire he announced on Friday, 20 June. We hope that the plan will serve as a stepping stone for all parties involved to commit to finding a long-term peaceful solution to the crisis and the suffering of Ukrainians. In that regard, we welcome the decisions by the separatist groups to observe a ceasefire until Friday, 27 June. We see these parallel ceasefires as providing new momentum for the political talks in the framework of the peace plan presented by President Poroshenko. At the same time, we commend today’s decision of President Vladimir Putin of the Russian Federation to request the Federation Council to revoke his right to use force in eastern Ukraine, as well as for his call on all parties to the Ukrainian conflict to cease hostilities and sit down at the negotiating table.
Despite the aforementioned possible developments, we are concerned at the alarming level of escalation, particularly criminal activities and reports of serious human rights violations. We condemn the continuing abductions, detentions, acts of ill treatment and torture, arbitrary arrests and sexual harassment. The reported cases of forced disappearances are extremely worrying. We urge the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine and the National Preventive Mechanism, in cooperation with the Ombudsperson, to continue their efforts to ensure that human rights of those who remain detained are upheld.
We further call for the immediate release of the monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, held captive since 26 and 29 May. The reported increase in the number of internally displaced persons is also concerning, but even more so are the reports of limited access to humanitarian actors, who are unable to reach the internally displaced persons in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. We urge all actors to ensure that those in need have access to humanitarian support. We equally urge the Government of Ukraine to establish a corridor for the safe passage of civilians and to provide the necessary security. The consequences of the violence in southern and eastern Ukraine have impacted the already dire economic situation, with a poverty rate of 24.7 per cent in youth unemployment and a lack of access to medical services. The delivery of medication and other necessities has been challenging as a result of instability.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that the Council needs to unite and rally behind the people of Ukraine. We must show them that we are committed to the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as to our own responsibility to maintain international peace and security. Let me reiterate our call on the armed groups to disarm and adhere to the ceasefire, engage in constructive dialogue, and support the ongoing efforts to de-escalate the crisis.","I thank Mr. Tayé-Brook Zerihoun and Mr. Ivan Šimonović for their briefings on the situation in Ukraine. Argentina will concentrate specifically on the theme and the focus of today’s meeting, namely, to analyse the report of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine.
In that regard, like our colleagues, we are concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the eastern part of Ukraine. The living conditions of the majority of the population, the actions of armed groups, the increasing number of armed persons and weapons, unilateral acts, worsening of violations of human rights and confrontations seem to spreading. Without any doubt we are all aware that those trends have to be dealt with in an urgent manner. The toll in human lives increases with each violent confrontation, and the lives and rights of residents of the affected areas are threatened. We therefore cannot be optimistic but I do believe that we are facing a scenario in which there is awareness that priority must be given to having an open dialogue and finding a political solution to this crisis.
However, we cannot ignore the violations of human rights described in the report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The killing, torture, kidnapping, harassment, illegal detention and intimidation are unjustified. All allegations should be investigated and those responsible should be brought to justice. All the necessary measures must be taken to protect all the human rights of everyone in Ukraine and to ensure their full enjoyment, irrespective of ethnicity, language, cultural group, religion or the region of the country in which they live.
We have taken note and understood how the increase in violence impacts those living in the areas affected by the confrontations. It was therefore clear that a direct consequence of that would be an increase in displaced persons and in the number of people to leave the region — for example, from Donetsk — access to water in Slovyansk and other areas in the Donetsk region having been limited, along with limited access to health services and a lack of electricity and gas, as well as problems with the availability of food and medical supplies. All of that has served not just to subject the population to difficult living conditions; I wish to repeat that it demands a positive attitude to finding a solution to the crisis. I will conclude my observations by mentioning the 15 points set out by the Government of Ukraine, which I appreciate. It is also very important, in particular with regard to points 14 and 15 of the plan, that discussions also take on board not just the talks between the State and the regions, armed groups and various minorities, but also the behaviour of the market. I say that because, in listening to Mr. Šimonović say that there is an extreme humanitarian crisis that is creating great suffering for a huge segment of the population, we also see in the document that has been circulated to us that the cost of food has increased dramatically, with some seasonal vegetables being four or five times more expensive than in the past.
We know that during crises, whether they be security, political, economic or social, some unscrupulous market players, who do not sit with us here to reconcile our differences — we do not even know where they are — well know how to speculate when it comes to the cost of food. No Valerie Amos can hold back, and no Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance can be up to the task, if we remain indifferent to such actions, which are ethically reprehensible. We should discuss that in the forum where it should be discussed: the organs of the United Nations.
We believe it is necessary to take every measure to address the situation effectively, while ensuring that assistance reaches those who need it, including in the areas that are still outside of Government control, and facilitating the conditions for the civilians who wish to leave the areas affected by the conflict to be able to do so.
Finally, I should like to make the following brief points. Argentina insists on the need to redouble efforts on the part of all stakeholders to demonstrate political will and the belief that the only acceptable way forward is through dialogue and that resorting to violence is not an option.
Secondly, Argentina will support any initiative that might genuinely contribute to putting an end to the violence and providing a space for constructive negotiations and reaching a political compromise among the parties.
Thirdly, the measures agreed in Geneva and the road map of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) continue to be a road map, the effective implementation of which by all parties will allow us to de-escalate the situation and move forward in a process of national dialogue that generates trust among the various communities and provides assurance for all Ukrainians that their main demands will be heard and their rights respected.
Fourthly, we are pleased with the efforts being made by the democratically elected Ukrainian Government for a peaceful settlement to the country’s situation and with the steps taken by the Russian authorities to the same end.
Fifthly, it is vital to combat the hate speech, discrimination, hostility and violence. Argentina reaffirms its respect for, defence of and belief that the international community and all its Member States must act within the framework of respect for international law and the Charter of the United Nations.
Along with the representative of Nigeria, we too hope that the rebels’ promise to release the OSCE detainees will come to pass. In that connection, we have asked many times that they be released unconditionally and without delay. ","I, too, thank Mr. Tayé-Brook Zerihoun, Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, and Mr. Ivan Šimonović, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, for their briefings.
Luxembourg welcomes the resolute action taken by the democratically elected President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, to restore peace and stability in eastern Ukraine. We welcome his decision to take a first essential step towards de-escalation by announcing the comprehensive 15-point peace plan and by establishing a unilateral ceasefire to allow the peace plan to be implemented. That decision has already had a positive effect, since last night it led to a separatist leader of the Donetsk region responding to the presidential initiative by committing, for his part, to observing a ceasefire until next Friday. We welcome the constructive role played by the current chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in that regard.
Russia has a key role to play in achieving a sustainable de-escalation of the situation. We call on that country to use all its influence with the separatists so that they stop the violence, lay down their arms once and for all and release the OSCE observers. We also call on Russia to take effective steps to stop the continuous flow of weapons and fighters to Ukraine and thereby to establish conditions conducive to the implementation of the peace plan announced on Friday by President Poroshenko.
A political solution is crucial to improving the living conditions of the Ukrainians in the areas controlled by separatist armed groups in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Luxembourg shares the concern of the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights over the collapse of public order and respect for the rule of law in those areas. We are very concerned about the increasing number of abductions, detentions, cases of torture and killings by the separatists. The crimes and human rights abuses no longer target only local politicians, activists and independent journalists but also now affect the population of those regions in general.
The combined effect of the presence of armed groups committing illegal acts and the increased exchange of fire between separatists and the Ukrainian armed forces has had a negative impact on the human rights of the people living in areas that are under the control of separatists. The public services are severely disrupted. We are also concerned about the number of internally displaced people, which continues to increase.
The situation in Crimea is of concern, as well. The monthly reports of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights show that the human rights situation has severely deteriorated since the holding of the illegal referendum on 16 March and the annexation by Russia. Residents of Crimea who support the unity of Ukraine are intimidated and subject to discrimination. The fundamental freedoms ensured by Ukrainian law are being challenged and minorities live in fear.
Luxembourg remains firmly committed to the sovereignty, political independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, which are basic principles affirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 68/262 of 27 March. Pending the restoration of the territorial integrity of Ukraine, we call on the authorities that are controlling Crimea to allow access for international observers, in particular, the United Nations human rights monitoring mission.
The third report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights underscores the practical steps taken by the Ukrainian Government to fulfil its obligations under the joint statement adopted on 17 April in Geneva by Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union. A second crucial step was taken with the presentation of the peace plan and the establishment of a ceasefire.
The international community expects Russia also to send a clear signal of its willingness to achieve a true de-escalation. Apart from increased monitoring of its border and condemnation of violence by armed groups in eastern Ukraine, we call on Russia to continue to withdraw its troops from the Ukrainian border and to refrain from a build-up of troops on the border. We also call for the order of the Federation Council authorizing the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of Ukraine to be overturned. We note the step that has been taken today in that regard by the President of the Russian Federation.
The election of a President whose legitimacy is unquestionable, the dialogue established between Kyiv and Moscow since the election of President Poroshenko, his announcement of a peace plan and the declaration of a ceasefire are encouraging elements. We hope that they will be a decisive turning point in the search for a political solution to the crisis in Ukraine. All good will must now be mobilized to take advantage of this opportunity and put an end to a crisis that has already caused too many casualties and suffering among the civilian population in eastern and southern Ukraine. ","I would like to thank Assistant Secretaries-General Zerihoun and Šimonović for their briefings.
The Republic of Korea appreciates the dedicated work of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine and its informative and comprehensive report.
The recent report of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission identified a number of worrying human rights concerns in Ukraine, particularly in the eastern region. We note with deep concern that the human rights situation in Donetsk and Lugansk has continued to deteriorate with increased violence and criminal activities by illegal armed groups. We are particularly disheartened to learn that lawlessness and violence, including abductions, arbitrary detentions, torture, harassment and killings are now affecting the broader population of those regions. Moreover, the continuing clashes between the armed groups and the Ukrainian forces exacerbate the situation, resulting in an increased loss of life, further displacement and the destruction of vital infrastructure.
In the light of such a volatile situation, we welcome the efforts of the Ukrainian Government to stop the escalation of violence and seek a peaceful settlement as shown in President Poroshenko’s peace plan. We call for the illegal armed groups to reciprocate those efforts and immediately halt all acts of violence and lay down their arms. It is important to ensure the full implementation of the peace plan in order to achieve a sustainable solution to the crisis. In that regard, we welcome the fact that Russian President Putin has expressed support for the peace plan.
At the same time, we reiterate that an inclusive political process is the essential foundation for a stable and democratic future for all Ukrainian people. We encourage the Ukrainian Government, building on the legitimacy of the democratically elected president, to lead comprehensive reform measures that reflect the wishes of all Ukrainians. The protection of all ethnic and linguistic minorities should be a priority in that process.
Finally, we appreciate the ongoing diplomatic efforts towards the stabilization of Ukraine, in particular those of the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union and bilateral partners. We encourage all parties to continue such efforts to seek a peaceful political solution."
S/PV.7185,28/05/2014,Follow-up on the early presidential elections in Ukraine (2014),"I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing. China has taken note of the presidential election held in Ukraine on 25 May and respects the choice made by the people of Ukraine. At present, he continuing problems and occasional outbreaks of armed conflict and violence in Ukraine have resulted in heavy casualties and loss of life, about which China is deeply concerned. Regarding the situation in Ukraine in general, I would like to stress the following points. First, China adheres consistently to the principle of non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs and respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, including Ukraine. We urge all parties in Ukraine to remain calm and restrained, bring an immediate halt to the violence, avoid harming innocent people and prevent the further escalation of tension and worsening of the situation. China hopes to see stability return with the early restoration of law and order in the country. Secondly, the crisis in Ukraine involves complex historical factors and ethnic conflicts. A political solution is the only way to defuse it. We hope all the parties will continue with dialogue and negotiations and will push for a settlement of the crisis through political means, by giving full recognition to the legitimate rights, interests and aspirations of every region and ethnic group in the country, accommodating all parties’ legitimate concerns and achieving a balance of interests among them. Thirdly, China supports the international community as it continues to use its good offices to ease the situation in Ukraine. It is an urgent priority that all parties refrain from making threats and imposing sanctions and return to the consensus of the four-party Geneva talks to ensure full implementation of that consensus and, on the basis of that agreement, resume the four-party talks and allow political dialogue to play the major role in reaching a negotiated settlement to the crisis, seeking common ground while avoiding conflict and confrontation. Fourthly, China has always adopted a fair and objective approach on the issue of Ukraine and has advocated a three-principles initiative that we had proposed for a political solution to the Ukraine crisis. We have continued, in our own way, working with all parties. We are in favour of any option that is conducive to easing tensions and promoting a negotiated political settlement, and we are willing to continue our constructive role.","I, too, thank Mr. Feltman for his briefing. The Ukrainian crisis has recently seen a turning point with the election of Mr. Poroshenko as President of the Republic. On Sunday 25 May, the Ukrainian people at last made its voice heard through the free and transparent elections despite the violence by separatist armed groups in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east of the country. In the first round, there was a rapid and clear result. We welcome Mr. Poroshenko’s victory. We affirm that we are fully ready to work with him. From the first round, with its high turnout, the election demonstrated to us the aspiration of most Ukrainians for unity. I would like to briefly come back to the elections. First, they were free, as there were no fewer than 21 registered candidates. That number speaks to the vast array of policies on which all Ukrainians were urged to vote on Sunday in order to build their future. There was not only one candidate or a predetermined outcome. Next, they were tansparent, as 2,784 international observers were accredited to ensure their smooth conduct. Yesterday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reported that the election respected democratic norms. The President-elect is therefore fully legitimate. We will closley review the results of the Central Electoral Commission and the assessment to be made by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights on the conduct of the elections. In passing, I note that the results also affirm, as if it were necessary, the extent to which the propaganda condemning the influence of the fascists in Ukraine was baseless. The two parties of the extreme right received less than 3 per cent of votes. The elections are therefore good news, given that their conduct was threatened on many occasions. However, we recall that they took place in a particularly difficult security context. The situation in the Donbass region remains of great concern. Human rights violations and restrictions on the freedom of the press are increasing. Two journalists were killed last Saturday. Four OSCE monitors were abducted in Donetsk and are still being detained. They must be released immediately. Donetsk airport was occupied by armed separatist groups, before being retaken by Ukrainian forces. The armed separatist groups must immediately cease their activities. We call on all those who have influence over them to use that influence to allow for a return to calm. Finally, let us no forget that Crimea remains occupied. In this tense situation, Sunday’s elections represent nonetheless an opportunity. Mr. Poroshenko, who will take the reins of Ukraine in early June, will have three priorities: to restore calm, establish an inclusive Government and undertake reforms. Those three priorities should be based on national dialogue, which must be extended and deepened. Today, for Ukraine, there is no other way forward than the path of unity and reconciliation. In that context, we hope that Mr. Poroshenko will work to consolidate the unity of his country by continuing the process of Ukrainian national dialogue launched with the support of the OSCE on 14 May, and by supporting the implementation of the memorandum on peace and harmony, adopted by the Rada on 20 May. Those initiatives, which provide for inclusive constitutional reform for decentralization and guarantee the status of the Russian language, are steps in the right direction. The process must first and foremost be led by Ukraine itself, with the support of the OSCE. The European Union stands ready to support those efforts, as recalled by the Heads of State in their declaration at the Council of Europe yesterday. However, it is up to the international community as a whole to stand by Ukraine in a useful way in writing the next pages of its history.","The 25 May elections were a step in the right direction. As the President of Russia, Mr. Vladimir Putin, stated before they were conducted, “we respect the elections of the Ukrainian people”. However, we would stop short of the euphoria that our Western colleagues have demonstrated. Elections are not a panacea. In evaluating them and their potential consequences, there is a need to take into account the events that preceded them and the context in which they took place. We cannot forget the havoc wreaked by those who opposed the legitimately elected President or the coup d’etat carried out with outside support and help from national radical forces. We cannot forget the tragedies that took place in Odessa on 2 May and in Mariupol on 9 May. We cannot remain deaf to the mortar fire in the south-east, where punitive operations are being carried out. We have to recognize that the elections were not totally free and democratic. A heavy influence was brought to bear, including the threat of physical violence, in favour of certain candidates, while others were forced to withdraw from the electoral race. The elections saw the violent suppresion of the mass media. The consolidation of the population was achieved essentially through the marginalization and terrorizing of entire regions and the spreading of anti-Russian propaganda. However, today we cannot simply discuss the electoral process in one particular country. The Security Council has the entirely different mandate of bearing primary responsibility for international peace and security. When a portion of Ukraine is essentially at war, we in this Chamber should be talking about how to end the violence and to move the situation onto a more peaceful front by faciliating negotiations among all Ukrainian parties. For Russia, that task is of particular importance, given that the military operations are taking place extremely close to our borders. Security Council members should call upon Kyiv to finally acknowledge the need to take the interests of all citizens of the country into account and to put a swift end to the punitive operations in the east and south. That is what is its citizens expect and what is required of Kyiv in line with its obligations under the Geneva declaration and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) road map. It would allow for genuine, nationwide dialogue to agree on comprehensive constitutional reforms. Genuine dialogue is needed rather than punitive operations behind the smoke screen of round tables organized without the participation of representatives of the east and south of the country. It is interesting that immediately after the elections, the memorandum on peace and concord was somehow forgotten. Instead of seeking agreement among citizens, they are assaulted by insults. Russia is blamed for every possible problem. There are calls for to end the punitive operations swiftly by intensifying them. People are being pushed into the army and the so-called national guard. Those who do not want to kill their own people are dealt with. There has been increasing use of air assets, tanks, armoured vehicles and mortar guns, and the chaotic bombing and artillery fire against civilian targets, including schools, kindergartens and hospitals. In spite of the calls of the leaders of besieged cities, peaceful citizens are not allowed to leave military areas. There are no secure humanitarian corridors, and the Ukrainian authorities are taking no measure for the evacuation of children or the unification of separated families. The provisions of the 1989 (2011) United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child are violated, as are the basic safeguards stipulated in Additional Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions. We regret to note that some Council members continue to justify, in all possible ways, the military actions of the Kyiv powers. Today, indeed, a colleague qualified actions in that context as admirable in manifesting restraint. We would like to say: You shall answer to God, ladies and gentlemen. There is much evidence in the mass media and video material on the use by Ukrainian forces of helicopters displaying United Nations markings. The latest such instance was observed as recently as 26 May in the skies over the Luhansk region. We call upon the United Nations Secretariat not to be passive in situations where United Nations rules are violated but to deal with the issue and take active measures to put an end to those practices that discredit the United Nations. A simple negation of the facts by the Kyiv authorities is not enough. The road map of the OSCE contains plans to investigate all cases of mass killings. However, there has been no progress in that respect. The investigation of the incidents of 18 through 20 February in the Maidan, including repercussions of the case of the sniper, have not fared any better. There has been no response to our urgent calls for an international investigation into the tragic events in Odessa on 2 May, when, as is known, an unidentified lethal chemical substance was used, nor of the incident of 9 May in Mariupol. The Ukrainian side is avoiding serious interaction with international structures on this issue. Representatives of the mass media face ongoing threats and persecution by the Ukrainian authorities, who prevent them from carrying out their professional activities and investigating the chaos in the country. Today everybody knows of the outrageous detention of journalists from the Russian television channel “Life News” and the cruel treatment they suffered. We have lost count of the cases of journalists who have been refused entry into Ukrainian territory or expelled on far-fetched pretexts. We express condolences to the families of the Italian journalist and his Russian companion, who died at the hands of the Ukrainian forces. We are seriously concerned about the situation of the two groups of OSCE observers. One group included a Russian citizen. We will do everything we can to find and liberate those who have not yet been freed. Nevertheless, we call attention to the fact that primary responsibility for the security of the observers attaches to the Ukrainian side. However, Kyiv has not yet concluded the internal State procedures for ratification of the memorandum of understanding with the OSCE guaranteeing the inviolability of staff of international missions. Ambiguity in the status of OSCE observers, who have been working in Ukraine for more than two months, is a genuine threat to their security. In conclusion, we truly hope that the presidential elections of 25 May will nevertheless mark the beginning of a new, more constructive period in the internal political life of the Ukrainian State. However, for that, it must be backed by specific actions for broad national agreement. Ukrainian politicians have many times violently taken advantage of their people. It is our hope that this will not occur during the current crucial period of the country. You looked at me, Mr. President, and I decided that I would say literally just a couple of words after all. Needless to say, I will not respond to the array of facts or pseudo-facts presented by my Ukrainian colleague, but I want to point out for the umpteenth time that the representative of Ukraine is ignoring the role of his own people. All his claims are directed at Russia, but the situation in eastern Ukraine arose at the very least after the Government overthrow in Kyiv on 22 February. We all know that perfectly well, and so do our Ukrainian colleagues, of course, but they prefer to ignore it, because they do not know what to say to the Ukrainian people. We again heard about the idea of Ukrainian unity. We have already expressed our concern in our statement, which I will not reiterate. However, blaming Russia will not resolve the issues of the Ukrainian people. I think that the representative of Ukraine making ironic comments about the Chechens is pointless. I do not understand. He could talk to them. Perhaps that could lead to a diaologue with the people in the southeast of Ukraine. But I will not go further into that issue. I will say that I liked the fact that at the very end of his remarks, he nevertheless gave an objective assessment of what is happening in southeast Ukraine. He talked about the poverty of that region. That is something that we should discuss. But talking about artillery strikes and bombardments will not resolve the poverty. I do not know whether the Ukrainian television showed it or not, but when the the people of Donetsk and Luhansk turned out for the referendum on 11 May it was not just a handful of people. It is a region of, I believe, 7 million residents in Donetsk and Luhansk together. Absolutely nothing was done to engage in a respectful dialogue with them. I do not know. If there have been some events that have drawn attention to the region, I hope that that will lead to constructive actions. But we have not seen that. Stop the military operations. Then perhaps we would help to establish a dialogue. That is what we have always said. Let us move forward and start a dialogue. Russia is ready to assist in establishing a dialogue. Russia came to Geneva and we drew up an agreement. But what did we see the Ukrainian authorities in Kyiv do? We saw them undertake punitive operations in violation of that agreement. So what happened to dialogue? We have always been ready to assist in setting up a dialogue and stand ready to do so now. So we hope that the military operation will stop as soon as possible, because how can we help while it continues? How can we assist in establishing dialogue in the southeastern regions if there is killing there? It is very difficult for us to talk about dialogue. As is known, in our country there are many ties with Ukraine, and 3 million of its people are dual citizens of Ukraine and Russia. Whether they have Russian passport and Moscow residency is not significant because they may have 30 relatives living in Ukraine, and so on. So that is what I mean. It is very difficult to say who is Russian, who is Ukrainian and who is half Russian and half Ukrainian. We all know that. Let us try to end on a constructive note. We agree that in that region there is a very difficult socioeconomic situation. The Ukrainian representative also mentioned Crimea. As he asked a question, I, too, will ask one. That is, why was the water shut off in Crimea? Why was the water supply in Crimea stopped? The economic situation is still bad 25 years after Ukrainian independence, and the water is shut off? It is clear that there is a poor socioeconomic situation in the east of the country. Let us together try to solve the issue. Let us cooperate. Can Russia and the Ukraine cooperate economically? Does the representative recall those serious proposals that we made? They were ongoing right up to time of the coup d’état that took place on 22 February. So Ukraine turned its back on all that. Now Ukraine talks of closing the border with Russia and leaving the Commonwealth of Independent States. It can clearly do that. There would not be free trade with us. But as for the issues of bilateral relations and cooperation in our region, what we now see is a military operation near the Russian border fanning the flames of anti-Russian rhetoric or policy. That is not constructive. I hope that Ukraine carefully reads the statements made by our Government. There are very constructive. I hope that the representative has listened closely to our statement today, which, in addition to its possible criticism also contains a number of constructive ideas as part of our policy on Ukraine. So we would like to turn the page as soon as possible, but much depends on Ukraine. First, it must stop the military chaos in the east of the country. I have already said this, but it was of course very difficult to listen to everything. The representative of Lithuania said that an Italian journalist had been killed but not by whom. The whole way in which when the Ukrainian armed forces do something, it is not mentioned. The representative of Luxembourg, who always talks a great deal about the humanitarian matters, spoke little about that. I recall the meeting on Crimea, when Ukrainian soldiers were killed. Some people thought they died as a result of Russian bullets. Then when the pro-Russian forces made it known that they were sniper bullets, the Security Council immediately expressed its condolences. Now dozens of people, including residents, are being killed in the east of the country. Some Council members say that the Kyiv authorities are showing exceptional restraint. That is very surprising. Why are we gathering today? If it is for the Security Council to undertake its political function, let us demonstrate how to put an end to the violence as quickly as possible. I perhaps heard another useful point from my Ukrainian colleague when he welcomed the mediation efforts of the Secretary-General. The Secretary-General could perhaps immediately stop the violence because the Ukrainian representative will soon welcome his role in ending the violence in the east of Ukraine. Let us do that in order to put an end to it. I am not certain how the representative of Ukraine wishes to engage in dialogue with us, but we believe that negotiations should address the broader agenda of our relations. They cannot be dictated by Kyiv on one, two, three or four specific points; they should be based on a broad agenda concerning our relations. I believe that there are good prospects for interraction between our two countries, so we should seek to develop them constructively and to find a way out of this difficult juncture in our relations and in the history of Ukraine as soon as possible. Russia did not cause the events in Ukraine, but we remain ready to help Ukraine find a solution if it can make the appropriate decisions. A very interesting and positive opportunity is available to Ukraine now that it has elected a President, who will shortly assume his mandate. He must take the right decisions, rather than measures that would only perpetuate the current stalemate.","I thank Mr. Feltman for his briefing this afternoon. We congratulate the Ukrainian people on the success of their historic presidential elections on Sunday, 25 May. The elections have been endorsed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as having been held largely in line with Ukraine’s international commitments and with respect for fundamental freedoms. After the turmoil of recent months, that is an outstanding achievement, which demonstrates the determination of the Ukrainian people to exercise their democratic rights and to set Ukraine on a new path towards stability. They have produced a Government whose legitimacy cannot be questioned and that deserves the full support of the international community. The decisive victory of Mr. Poroshenko sends a clear signal that the Ukrainian people are united in their demand for reform. We congratulate Mr. Poroshenko on his election. We welcome his commitment to reaching out to all regions, to normalizing relations with Russia and to working to restore stability and calm. The United Kingdom remains firmly committed to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the whole of Ukraine. We look forward to working with Mr. Poroshenko and the Ukrainian Government in their efforts to build a safe, independent and prosperous country. We also pay tribute to the staff of the Ukrainian Election Commission and to the OSCE for their tireless commitment to ensuring that the elections were a success, and particularly to those who face threats of violence and intimidation in the east of the country. The high turnout on Sunday offers a powerful rebuke to those illegal armed groups that sought to deny the citizens of Donetsk and Luhansk their democratic rights and that continue to pursue an armed campaign to destabilize eastern Ukraine. Opinion polling in March showed that 79 per cent in the east of Ukraine wanted to vote in the elections. In May, despite the rising levels of intimidation against election officials, activists and ordinary citizens, 62 per cent still wanted to vote. It is deeply regrettable that many in Donetsk and Luhansk were prevented from doing so. The elections gave Ukrainians the opportunity to express their views in a peaceful and democratic manner. It is telling that the response of illegal armed groups to that display of national unity was an attempt to seize control of Donetsk international airport. While Ukraine sought a national consensus through the ballot box, those groups immediately resorted to violence. We respect the Ukrainian Government’s right to respond to such armed attacks, to protect its citizens and to reassert control over its sovereign territory. No country could possibly accept illegal armed insurgents taking control by force of public buildings and a key national infrastructure, such as an international airport. The Ukrainian authorities have acted with admirable restraint in the fact of repeated provocation. We continue to urge them to ensure that their security response remains measured, proportionate and respects the safety and security of non-combatants. Since 21 February, the Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly demonstrated that they are committed to deep-rooted reform of Ukraine’s political system and to making a decisive break with past corruption and injustices. The issue of granting greater autonomy to Ukraine’s regions has been on the agenda from the start. In line with its commitment and those undertaken in Geneva, on 17 April they embarked on an intensive effort to initiate an inclusive national dialogue. That process represents a genuine opportunity for all Ukrainians to address their grievances peacefully. There can therefore be no justification for armed groups to continue to press their cause through violence. We therefore call on the insurgents to lay down their arms, renounce violence and join in this debate. We also call on the Russian Federation to take immediate action to prevent illegal crossings of insurgents and weapons across its border into Ukraine. We are deeply concerned by two separate incidents of abduction involving monitors from the OSCE special monitoring mission in eastern Ukraine. We welcome the release of 11 monitors after their detention earlier today in Donetsk, but four others who went missing on Monday are still unaccounted for. The detention of OSCE personnel is completely unacceptable, and we call for their immediate and unconditional release. The special monitoring mission has a vital role to play, often under difficult circumstances. We pay tribute to their continuing work. Sunday’s elections provide us all with an opportunity to look past the turmoil of recent months and to focus on the future. We welcome the recent statements by the Russian Federation of its intention to respect the right of the Ukrainian people to choose their new President and its commitment to reduing the threat of further external intervention in Ukraine’s internal affairs by withdrawing its forces from the Ukrainian border. Those are positive steps towards de-escalation, but more action is needed. Continued instability is not in the interests of the people of Ukraine or in the interests of its neighbours and those countries that value their relations with Ukraine. The actions of illegal armed groups have resulted in scores of tragic and unnecessary deaths and the disruption of the Ukrainian economy and public services in the east. That is hurting the very people that those groups claim to represent and is denying them a voice in determining Ukraine’s future. Following the Geneva agreement of 17 April and the OSCE road map of 7 May, we have a viable political framework in place. Ukraine has already made much progress towards implementing these agreements, including notably the adoption on 20 May of the memorandum of peace and concord. Our focus must now be on promoting an inclusive, transparent and accountable national dialogue as an alternative to violent insurgency. We welcome the three rounds of dialogue that have already taken place with OSCE facilitation. That national dialogue should allow all parties to contribute their views on issues such as decentralization, local self-governance, language and national minorities, balance of powers, State society relations and Ukraine’s role in Euro-Atlantic and Eur-Asian security. The past few months have seen deep divisions in the Security Council over Ukraine. Some of those divisions will undoubtedly persist; in particular, along with the overwhelming majority of the international community, the United Kingdom will not recognize or accept Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea. However, Sunday’s elections provide the Council with a basis for coming together behind some key principles: respect for the will of the people of Ukraine, recognition of the legitimacy of the new authorities in Ukraine, rejection of armed insurgency and attempts to destabilize Ukraine and undermine the rule of law, and strong support for the efforts of the authorities in Ukraine to tackle the many formidable challenges that confront them in an inclusive and democratic manner. The frameworks are in place to take those principles forward. The United Kingdom urges all Council members and the international community as a whole to join wholeheartedly in a concerted, constructive and united international approach.","I thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his comments today and for his engagement on the Ukrainian issue, including through trips to Ukraine. Ukrainians turned out in historic numbers on Sunday, uniting to express their political will to choose freely their own future. The United States congratulates the people of Ukraine on having voted in large numbers to express their clear desire for a united, democratic and peaceful Ukraine. The election reaffirms Ukraine’s commitment to the democratic process. We look forward to working with President-elect Poroshenko and the people of Ukraine to build on this victory for democracy in order to create a more unified, secure, transparent and prosperous Ukraine. We note the importance of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) judgement that the election was largely in line with Ukraine’s international commitments and demonstrated respect for fundamental freedoms in the vast majority of the country. Thousands of independent electoral observers — international and domestic — supported the OSCE determination. We thank the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the European Parliament, the NATO Parliamentary Assembly and the other international and non-governmental organizations and observers who contributed to the effort. But as we celebrate the successful 25 May presidential election, we must also condemn the actions of those who sought to derail the voting in parts of eastern Ukraine. In particular, we condemn the actions of pro-Russian armed separatists operating in Donetsk and Luhansk, who attacked district election commissions and polling stations and intimidated election workers, notably through abductions, death threats, forced entry into private homes, the seizure of equipment and election materials, and the shooting of a candidate proxy. Those illegal actions constituted attempts to obstruct the election and to interfere with citizens’ rights to participate. Yet even in those two regions of the east where pro-Russian separatist groups sought to disenfranchise the population, some courageous Ukrainians endeavoured to vote. The United States commends the resolve of the Ukrainian people to participate despite the threats, provocations, and violence. We take particular note of the Central Election Commission, which established special accommodations to enfranchise voters in the areas where separatists worked to disrupt voting, by allowing citizens to vote at alternate locations, and which made voting arrangements for Crimeans to vote outside of Ukraine’s Crimea region, which remains under Russian occupation. President-elect Poroshenko and the Ukrainian Government have many challenges before them. We are heartened by the President-elect’s stated goal to make national reconciliation a priority. Forging a common political vision will be essential. In that regard, we welcome the Ukrainian Government’s intention to continue the OSCE-supported national unity round tables, which have allowed Ukrainians from all regions and all political views to come together to discuss their differences and their common interests in a peaceful, unified and stable Ukraine. We also welcome the Rada’s 21 May memorandum of understanding and peace, which calls on all citizens to abandon radical actions and hatred and to protect, promote and build a democratic, sovereign and united Ukraine. We are also encouraged by President-elect Poroshenko’s willingness to seek greater decentralization for the regions, to pursue constitutional reforms following the election and to engage in dialogue with Russia. Since the Russian Federation has stated that it will respect the will expressed by the Ukrainian people, we urge Russia to recognize the results of Sunday’s election and begin to engage constructively with President-elect Poroshenko and the Ukrainian Government to resolve the crisis. Despite the progress made with Sunday’s election we are deeply concerned by the increased violence in Donetsk and Luhansk, including the seizure of the Donetsk airport by separatists, and we are disturbed by ongoing reports that separatists continue to carry out criminal actions in parts of eastern Ukraine. We recognize that Ukraine must uphold law and order on Ukrainian territory, and we call on the separatists to disarm and end the violence. Of particular concern are reports of the detention of international monitors from the OSCE after they were stopped at separatist checkpoints in the Donetsk region. We condemn the abductions and call on Russia to use its influence with the separatists to secure the the immediate release of the monitors and their unimpeded access throughout Ukraine. We also remain concerned by reports that armed groups and weapons continue to cross the border from Russia into Ukraine. We believe Russia can and must act to stem such provocative actions along the Russia-Ukraine border. In conclusion, let me reiterate my Government’s continued support for the aspirations of the people of Ukraine to a prosperous, sovereign, independent, and united Ukraine, including the Crimea region, with strong ties to both East and West. We remain committed to working with Ukraine and other partners in order to seek de-escalation and a peaceful resolution of the conflict and to respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine.",,,,,,,,,,,"Thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting on the current situation in Ukraine. I thank Mr. Feltman, Under-Secretary-General, for his briefing. I thank all Council members for supporting the elections held by Ukraine on 25 May and for the kind recommendations and encouragement to the new Government and President-elect regarding their plans in consolidating Ukraine.
I thank the Council for sharing assessments of the elections, which coincide with the assessments of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), one of the largest observer commissions. The OSCE stated that the presidential elections in Ukraine on 25 May were free, democratic and held in full conformity with national legislation and international standards. It has become an historic success of the Ukrainian people and their democratic State.
On 25 May, the people confirmed their readiness to protect their native land from existing external threats and their desire for peace and a European future, as well as an absolute rejection of Russian aggression. The vast majority of Ukrainian citizens — from all regions of the country, including occupied Crimea — participated in the vote at more than 90 per cent of the country’s polling stations, thereby confirming the full representativeness and legitimacy of their will.
It is important that the election results crushed all anti-Ukraine propaganda clichés. Were all the Ukrainian fascists or Nazis, when the so-called “ultra-nationalist” candidates gained minimum support in the elections? Where are all the phantom supporters of succession or of the federalization of Ukraine, when almost 90 per cent of the voters from all regions of the country, including occupied Crimea, cast their ballots for the candidates that stand for a unified Ukraine and its European integration? All participants in the presidential campaign acknowledged that it had been democratic and legitimate.
Mr. Petro Poroshenko received major support in all regions of Ukraine, including the eastern and southern regions, which confirms the strong will of the whole population of Ukraine for unity of the nation. The President-elect secured full legitimacy to fulfil his mandate on behalf of the entire Ukrainian nation.
Among his top priorities is to achieve stabilization and reconciliation of the eastern regions of Ukraine, which suffered from Russian propaganda and illegal activities of Russian insurgents and mercenaries. The President-elect has already announced that he plans to visit the Donbass region immediately after his inauguration, a clear signal to all in eastern Ukraine that their voices will be heard as long as they are peaceful. The 2014 presidential campaign was conducted at a time of social and political tensions, security challenges that Ukraine is facing for the first time in its modern history. Unfortunately, owing to the occupation of the territory of the autonomous republic of Crimea, it was impossible to set up electoral commissions and conduct the presidential election there. At the same time, citizens of Ukraine living in the occupied peninsula were given the opportunity to vote at polling stations in Kherson, which is close to Crimea, or at any other polling station in Ukraine.
The complex security situation in Donetsk and Luhansk significantly undermined the election process in those cities. According to the statement of preliminary findings and conclusions by the special monitoring mission, which can be found on the web page of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), serious problems were found in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, including intrusions into district electoral commissions and their eviction and closure by armed groups, and intimidation of election officials, which included abductions, death threats, forced entry into private homes, seizure of equipment and election materials, and the shooting of a candidate proxy.
“These illegal actions constituted an attempt to prevent the election [and] deny citizens the fundamental right to freely participate and elect their chosen representatives.”
After the election, Kremlin officials promised to respect the choice of the Ukrainian people. In the light of what is happening now on the Russian-Ukrainian border and in the region, we are taking that with a grain of salt. On 21, 24 and 26 May, dozens of armed people attacked Ukraine’s borders from the Russian side. Forty vehicles carrying armed personnel attempted to break through the Ukrainian frontier. We have still not had a reasonable answer from the Russian side to the question of what hundreds of men from the Chechen battalion are doing in Ukraine. They are not concealing their identity; they speak freely with reporters and admit that they have come from Russia to protect interests. What interests are Chechens going to protect in Ukraine? Those of the Greek Orthodox or of Slav ethnicity? We have also raised the question about what hundreds of heavily armed Russian Cossacks are doing in Ukraine, particularly those from the Wolves Centurion, a group with a notorious Second World War past. They are not concealing their identity either; they have been operating in Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, and before that they were in Crimea.
Another question is why most of the leaders of the illegal, self-proclaimed authorities in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions are Russian citizens. Aleksandr Borodai, the self-proclaimed prine minister of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, is a Russian citizen from Moscow. Igor Strelkov Girkin, a military commander of terrorists in Sloviansk, is a Russian citizen and a Russian military intelligence special forces officer. Igor Bezler, a military commander of a terrorist group based in Horlivka, is also a Russian citizen and a colonel in the Russian army, as he has publicly admitted. Who authorized those Russian citizens to represent the people of Donbass, to speak on their behalf and call on them to sacrifice their lives and kill their compatriots? On election day, 25 May, a pro-Russian insurgent group attacked a polling station in Novoaidar. As a result, one was killed and Ukrainian law enforcement detained a group of 13 people whose leader appeared to be a Russian citizen. Despite some hints of conciliatory rhetoric on the part of our Russian neighbour, which happens to be one of the permanent members of the Security Council, its aggression against a sovereign United Nations Member State has continued. In the wake of the election, we witnessed another brutal violation of Ukrainian territory by armed insurgent groups from the Russian side. Despite warnings passed on by Ukraine through diplomatic channels regarding a concentration on Russia’s border with Ukraine of up to 40 trucks containing armed personnel, the Russian side took no steps to prevent their breakthrough into Ukrainian territory. On 27 May, around 4 a.m., a convoy consisting of several trucks and passenger cars made an attempt to cross the State border. After an exchange of fire with Ukrainian border guard servicemen, part of the Russian motorcade managed to break through and proceeded in the direction of the town of Antratsyt. This happened while Russian border guards did absolutely nothing. Moreover, there is every reason to believe that the armed groups’ penetration into Ukrainian territory is organized, financed and encouraged from the Russian side.
Furthermore, the Russian Federation has failed to condemn Russian citizens’ participation in mercenary activities in Ukraine and has done nothing to prevent armed groups’ illegal penetration into the eastern part of Ukraine, thus conniving in such actions. We are in fact dealing with blatant aggression against Ukraine from the Russian side in the form of exporting instability into the territory of another country. Our law enforcement officers in the eastern regions of Ukraine are currently dealing with skilled, armed mercenaries who are ready to plunder, intimidate, torture and murder Ukrainian citizens. Today, armed pro-Russian groups began to attack peaceful citizens. They fired on a school and a residential area of Sloviansk. We have had no sign of any Russian condemnation of such acts. Instead, Russia has offered its humanitarian assistance to the population of eastern Ukraine, citing alleged appeals from local citizens and organizations. We would like to say to the Russian side that the only thing Russia can do for the people of Ukraine is to stop supporting the illegal military groups.
We appreciate the mediation role the Secretary-General has taken on with his recent statement on the peaceful settlement of the situation in the eastern region of Ukraine. The Ukrainian Government stands for a peaceful solution to the current situation. Peace can be achieved if the Russian side stops pouring professional mercenaries into Ukraine with the aim of destabilizing the situation in eastern Ukraine and stops encouraging separatism. We call on the Security Council and the international community to demand categorically that the Russian Federation cease its practice of provoking instability, withdraw all Russian armed forces, paramilitary organizations and groups, and citizens from Ukraine and fulfil their obligations undertaken under the Geneva agreement on Ukraine. As the Council knows, the Ukrainians are very patient people. We always find a way to agree. But in order to agree, there must be stability. In order to achieve stability, there cannot be a fuelling of instability. I asked many times what hundreds of armed Chechens were doing in Ukraine. What was their purpose? Had they come to to protect Ukrainian orthodoxy, or Slav ethnicity? I asked why hundreds of Cossacks in Crimea had come to destabilize the situation. That does not help us to resolve the issue but destabilizes the situation. Moreover, they are not hiding that or concealing who they are. I wondered what the Wolves Centurion, which was established in the 1950s and then formed the Cossack corpus of the Nazi Special Service, had come to do. To fight the fascists — those who themselves support Nazism? It is not very clear. It is unclear to us all what may happen if suddenly citizens of another country appear in our country. A group of 200 people gathered in the streets, calling itself a people’s republic and saying that they would lead it. That is what happened in Donetsk. A Russian citizen called himself Prime Minister. What does that help? Does it foster dialogue? Clearly not.
So today, when our sides have at least exchanged some views and if we see that there may be a solution as a result of a bilateral dialogue, we need to find a way to speak to those people. Why should Russia not also speak to them? Why does Russia not explain to them what it is doing in their country? It could be called mercenary activities rather than assistance. That is fuelling the flames of separatism, and it has continued for a long time. It is true that the Government did not do anything for 20 years to resolve the difficulties of the region. It is true that it is a depressed region, where there are no jobs. It is true that a State policy should address that. That has been said. However, it is necessary to assist and not seek to destabilize the situation. I have listened to the statement made by the representative of the Russian Federation, and I believe that the easiest way for his side to move forward would be as follows. He has told us what we should do, so I should like to tell him what Russia should do.
The Russian Government, the Minister for Foreign Affairs or whoever makes the decisions should appeal to their people, and first and foremost to the Chechen leadership. Instead of conducting manoeuvres during the presidential elections in Donetsk, those hundreds of Chechens should immediately leave Ukraine. That is the first requirement.
Secondly, with respect to the hundreds of Cossacks in Ukraine, as I recall the President of the Russian Federation took a decision regarding the presence of the Russian army. The presence of those Cossacks is therefore subject to a dual interpretation. It would thus be only right for Russia to call on them, too, to leave my country. Such an appeal could also be directed to Russian citizens who, for lack of direction, sign on as mercenaries. It would also be right to warn them against acting on their impulses.
With respect to Crimea, we have been in contact with the occupying Power concerning the issue of water. This is an economic problem, but the most pressing issue in Crimea has yet to be resolved. Crimea is Ukrainian territory, and we must resolve the issue of its restoration to Ukraine. That is our principled position. No one is rejecting Crimea. That is an issue we could consider together in negotiations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The people of Ukraine have spoken. Last Sunday, they cast their votes for the future of a united Ukraine in an election that was widely recognized as free and fair and in line with international standards by numerous international observers. As Ilkka Kanerva, head of the delegation sent to the elections by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said, “The impressive turnout ... offered a powerful rebuke to those who would challenge Ukraine’s unity and progress”.
Intimidations, kidnappings and seizures of ballot boxes and voting premises by pro-Russian separatists could not stop those who care for their country from expressing their will democratically and freely through a ballot box, in stark contrast to those who only know how to impose their will at gunpoint. Everywhere, including south-eastern Ukraine, the lead of President-elect Petro Poroshenko was clear and obvious, leaving no room whatsoever for speculations regarding the legitimacy of the election.
Importantly, Ukraine’s Sunday election demolished the myth of Ukraine’s radical extremism, which has been staple fodder for a repulsive anti-Ukrainian propaganda campaign. It is time to put to rest once and for all the shameless incitement against and demonization of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, which have done enormous damage to relations between the two nations and led to bloodshed under false pretexts on Ukraine’s soil.
The people of Ukraine have spoken. Sunday’s election results confirmed what we knew all along. While many in eastern Ukraine have legitimate grievances regarding their socioeconomic conditions and the relationship between the centre and the regions, they do not seek Ukraine’s fragmentation. On the contrary, the overwhelming majority of Ukraine’s citizens, including those in the east and south of the country, see their future in a united and democratic Ukraine.
The challenges facing the new President and his Government are enormous, as they will have to overcome decades of neglect and pervasive corruption, restore the rule of law, rebuild trust and confidence among the citizens and regions, as well as between the citizens and their Government, by implementing comprehensive and inclusive political and economic reforms. The national dialogue meetings and the recently adopted memorandum on peace and concord offer good grounds for openness and inclusiveness, as well as the involvement of the broadest groups of Ukraine’s society as the country seeks to break away from the corrupt legacy of past rule. We wish the President-elect and the people of Ukraine all the very best in that important endeavour.
At the same time, we stress once again that Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable and must be respected by all. We welcome the statements by Russia’s leaders that they will respect the outcome of Ukraine’s vote. It is now time for them to walk the walk. It is time for Russia to discard its propaganda war against Ukraine and to engage in a genuine and meaningful dialogue. We urge Russia to fully withdraw its troops from the Ukrainian border and to stop the free flow of arms, weaponry and foreign fighters into Ukrainian territory. Ukraine’s borders and air space must be respected.
In view of Russia’s influence on and contacts with illegal armed groups, it is key that Russia unequivocally denounce, condemn and disassociate itself from the militant separatism plaguing Ukraine’s south-east. Such steps are essential to helping restore a sense of trust between the two neighbouring States and to embark on a path of de-escalation, on the basis of the 17 April Geneva statement and with the continued monitoring and support of the international community on the ground.
Crimea’s occupation has led to growing numbers of internally displaced persons, who now number nearly 10,000. The countless acts of violence committed by heavily armed separatist groups — such as ongoing banditry and looting, extortions, intimidation, abductions, beatings, torture, bloody ambushes and killings — are in direct violation of the human and social rights of the people they falsely claim to represent. The separatists in eastern Ukraine defy the very basic principles of national and international law and flaunt their contempt for human rights. Cases of illegal self-proclaimed people’s courts sentencing local officials to death, followed by actual executions, have been reported. The increasing involvement of foreign fighters, including Chechen mercenaries, is deeply worrying and may, if unchecked, spin out of control.
The false and dangerously misleading narrative of fighting Ukrainian fascists continues to be exploited. The deliberate targeting of journalists, including attacks, beatings and abductions, as well as the confiscation and destruction of their equipment, have been reported. A young Italian journalist lost his life. Such attacks must be firmly condemned. Only a few days ago, the self-proclaimed mayor of Sloviansk confirmed that his group alone held some 40 hostages. The overall number of hostages and forced disappearances is obviously higher and remains a cause of serious concern. For example, 12 high-ranking police officers were abducted by armed separatists in the Luhansk region on 26 May.
International monitors are increasingly under attack, including the abduction on Monday, 26 May, of four representatives of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) special monitoring mission, which was the second such incident in two months. Earlier today, we received alarming information that another 11 OSCE monitors had been detained by pro-Russian separatists on their way from Donetsk to Dnipropetrovsk. They have now been released. Lithuania strongly condemns all interference with the work of international observers and urges all parties to ensure that they can carry out their important work in safety and security.
No country would sit idle and watch indifferently as groups of insurgents armed with illegally obtained weapons, increasingly with the help of foreign mercenaries, go about disrupting the functioning of the State and its very statehood by intimidation, violence and force. In the face of the ongoing onslaught against the State of Ukraine, we stress Ukraine’s legitimate right to defend its statehood and territorial integrity from illegal separatist groups that have taken up arms against their own country and demonstrate utter disdain for its Constitution, its laws and its people. While reiterating our commitment to Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, we stand ready to support its new leadership and the people of Ukraine on the path of democratic reforms and peace. The people of Ukraine have spoken. Each and every one of us must respect their choice.","I thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his update on the situation in Ukraine, which by all accounts remains tense. The armed attacks of last week that led to the deaths of 16 Ukrainian soldiers near Donetsk represent a very serious escalation of the crisis. We condemn attacks against security forces carrying out legitimate orders. We note the conduct of presidential elections on 25 May and the outcome. We see the election of a new President as a significant first step towards the normalization of the situation in Ukraine. Issues of human rights still need to be addressed, as do improving the economy, fostering inclusiveness and strengthening national cohesion and reconciliation.
An improvement in bilateral relations between Russia and Ukraine remains central to resolving the crisis in Ukraine. That is why we welcome the decision of Russian President Vladimir Putin to respect the outcome of the elections in Ukraine. We also welcome the offer of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to start a dialogue with the incoming leadership of Ukraine. President-elect Poroshenko has also indicated that he will reach out to Russia. Those are encouraging signs that convince us that the doors to a diplomatic solution remain open.
We reiterate our position that dialogue among all concerned parties and stakeholders is the path to sustainable peace, security and stability in Ukraine. We urge all armed groups in eastern Ukraine to lay down their arms, refrain from violence, and desist from occupying public buildings, erecting road blocks, illegally detaining international officials and challenging the authority of the State. We restate our position that the declaration of a people’s republic of Donetsk and other separatist and secessionist pronouncements violate the Constitution of Ukraine and are therefore of no legal effect. We call on all concerned to respect the independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, in line with the Charter of the United Nations.","We thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for the briefing he has just provided to the Council.
Jordan welcomes the successful holding of presidential elections in Ukraine, despite the exceptional circumstances in the country caused by the illegal actions of lawless individuals and rebels seeking to prevent a successful voting process. It is our hope that the elections will signal a return to stability in Ukraine and lead it down the road to democracy. We commend the efforts of the Ukraine Government to ensure successful elections by eliminating obstacles in order to allow all Ukrainians to vote for their future. Now that Ukrainians have been able to vote fully and freely, the international community must respect their choice. We urge the international community to recognize the results of the election and to work with President-elect Petro Poroshenko so as to enable him to meet his people’s aspirations to a better future.
We express our concern about continuing acts of violence and criminality in eastern Ukraine, especially in the Donestk region, where there have been a number of casualties. Jordan reaffirms Ukraine’s legitimate rights, guaranteed under international law, to protect its territorial integrity, sovereignty and the security of its citizenry. The exercise by the authorities of their right to calm tensions and restore stability must be in line with international law and international humanitarian law. We reaffirm our call on all influential parties to persuade the rebels to lay down their weapons and to withdraw from the buildings and facilities they are occupying. ","We are grateful for the report of Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman and for the convening of this meeting.
My delegation closely followed the elections that took place on Sunday, 25 May, in which Mr. Poroshenko was declared the winner. We value the cooperation extended to the provisional Government of Ukraine, especially the support provided by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) by sending more than 1,000 electoral observers and logistical support, which was fundamental to the success of the elections.
We believe that the elections are a crucial step in the political process, which should restore the stability of the country on the basis of inclusive dialogue with full respect for minorities, human rights and the rule of law. Nevertheless, we deplore the fact that the electoral process did not cover the entire territory of Ukraine. We call on those groups that sought to prevent the elections from taking place normally to join the building of a new future in their country in which all groups and minorities will feel involved. We also recognize the major responsibility of the Ukrainian authorities, both the current and the elected ones, to undertake the political process in an orderly fashion. In that context, we deplore the violent events that took place in Donetsk in the days after the election, and we express our concern at the consequences of a potential escalation of the crisis.
Nevertheless, the political process has not come to an end with the elections. The fundamental responsibilty falls to the Ukrainian authorities, but equally important is the contribution of countries of the region and regional organizations to continue cooperating in the finalization of the process. We also underscore the various initiatives of the Secretary-General and, definitely, those of the entire United Nations system, which has sought a political solution from the very beginning of the crisis.
We call on both the Government and separatist groups to establish common ground on the basis of which a dialogue can take place, thereby putting an end to all current areas of violence. We reiterate our support for the calls of the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Mr. Ivan Šimonović, for accountability for all human rights violations and abuses and for the perpetrators, whoever they may be, to br brought to justice.
Finally, Chile once again reaffirms the need to respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. A new phase is beginning in Ukraine. Accordingly, a new era of cooperation should begin in the Council in order to enable it to help establish the conditions for the Ukrainian people to pursue their sovereign future in peace and democracy. ","I thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, for his briefing.
Chad welcomes the holding of presidential elections in Ukraine on 25 May and its turnout of more than 60 per cent. The Ukrainians were able to vote freely and elect Mr. Petro Poroshenko in a transparent manner, with 55 per cent of the vote in the first round. We congratulate the Ukrainian people and their new President-elect, Mr. Poroshenko. Despite the challenges in the eastern part of the country, where the ballot was disrupted by ongoing violence, the elections went smoothly. Chad hopes that the elections, whose proper conduct was attested to by all international observers, will endow the new President-elect with the legitimacy and authority necessary to establish trust among all components of Ukrainian society and preserve unity of the country while respecting its diversity.
The election of the new President-elect marks a major step in the consolidation of democracy and starts a new phase that should allow a process of stabilization and economic recovery in the country to be initiated through dialogue. The international community must support the new Ukrainian authorities in meeting the numerous challenges before them. While we welcome the important step taken in the presidential elections in Ukraine, Chad remains concerned by the situation in the eastern part of the country. Chad condemns the ongoing acts of violence in the east, which have led to several deaths and the kidnapping of four monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), whose immediate release we demand from their captors. Chad reiterates its call for the immediate cessation of fighting and invites all the parties to refrain from the use of force and to favour a peaceful way out of the crisis through dialogue.
In that regard, the task of bringing peace and reconciliation to all the Ukrainian people falls principally on the new President-elect in his capacity as President of all Ukrainians without exception. In that context, we invite the armed groups to lay down their arms and start direct negotiations with the new Ukrainian authorities in order to restore peace and preserve the country’s unity. We believe that frank and open dialogue is the best response to all expectations and anxieties. Unilateral proclamations of independence on a part of the Ukrainian territory will not call into question the integrity and sovereignty of the country to which Chad remains committed.
In that perspective, Chad recognizes the importance of the mediation of the international community in general, and of the United Nations, the OSCE and Ukraine’s neighbours in particular, in the search for a peaceful result to the crisis in Ukraine. Chad gives its full support to all good offices. ","I thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing.
Australia congratulates Ukraine on the successful holding of presidential elections on 25 May. The high turnout, in which millions people cast ballots across the country, reflects the determination of the Ukrainian people to chose their own Government without interference. It is a demonstration of their commitment to a sovereign, democratic and independent Ukraine.
We commend the work of the Ukrainian electoral authorities and the willingness of the Ukrainian political parties to participate and support the electoral process in difficult circumstances. We also commend the observer mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for its efforts across the country. We welcome the OSCE’s preliminary findings that the elections were held in line with international standards and respect for fundamental freedoms. We congratulate President-elect Petro Poroschenko, who has been given a clear mandate to govern Ukraine.
Regrettably, not all Ukrainians were able to vote. In two areas in eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian separatist forces prevented many polling stations from opening, depriving of their right to cast their ballots. We commend the efforts of the Ukrainian authorities to perform their electoral duties in those areas in the face of threats, intimidation and violence. Due to the unlawful annexation of Crimea, the Ukrainian citizens in that region were unable to cast their votes at all. We applaud those who travelled from the Crimean peninsula specifically in order to vote elsewhere in Ukraine. That was a clear expression of support on their part for a democratic and unified Ukraine.
The restoration of stability in the east presents a very serious challenge for the new Ukrainian Government. Pro-Russian groups continue their efforts to destabilize the region, attacking Ukrainian forces, occupying administrative buildings and targeting major infrastructure, such as Donetsk airport. Reports that militants have attempted to cross the border from Russia into Ukraine in the past few days are deeply concerning. It is essential that Russia control its borders to prevent any such incursions. In such circumstances of continued destabilization and the use of force by separatists, the Ukrainian authorities have the right to protect their own citizens and to re-establish control over their territory. They should continue to do so in a manner proportionate to the circumstances.
Given the current instability, the efforts of journalists and monitors are particularly crucial. We condemn the continuing attacks by separatists on journalists, as the OSCE Representative on Media Freedom, Ms. Mijatović, stated on 23 May. Journalists are deliberately targeted for doing their job of trying to tell the outside world of the events taking place in Ukraine. We condemn the killing of an Italian journalist and his assistant near Sloviansk on 24 May. We are also deeply concerned about reports that the four missing OSCE monitors in the Donetsk region are being held by separatists. They must be released immediately. While we, of course, welcome the safe release today of 11 OSCE monitors, we share the Secretary-General’s concern that international staff in Ukraine continue to be placed in great danger. We agree with him that the detention of international staff is completely unacceptable.
The conduct of the presidential elections on 25 May was a central element of the OSCE road map for the stabilization of Ukraine. The country now has the opportunity to secure a stable and peaceful future. We welcome the President-elect’s commitment to travelling to the east and to engage closely with the communities there to overcome their differences. Such an inclusive approach will be crucial to ensuring a successful constitutional reform process. We welcome President Putin’s statement that Russia will respect the election outcome. It is now time for serious dialogue between Russia and Ukraine and an express commitment on the part of Russia to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. That is so clearly in the interest of both countries. As Australia’s Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop, said on 26 May, Australia stands with the people of Ukraine, who have shown through the election their commitment to democracy and political and economic stability and to determining their own Ukrainian future. We share the Secretary-General’s desire to see the international community unite in support of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Ukriane. Australia looks forward to working with the new Ukrainian leadership. ",,,,"I thank the President for convening today’s meeting. I also thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, for his briefing on the situation in Ukraine. Rwanda welcomes Sunday’s presidential elections. We congratulate President-elect Petro Poroshenko for his decisive victory that will provide him with the legitimacy required to end the Ukrainian crisis.
As reported by several national and international monitors, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), elections in most of Ukraine were free, fair and peaceful, with a high turnout of over 60 per cent, despite reported cases of polling irregularities and disruptions. However, it is unfortunate that Ukrainians in some areas in the eastern part of the country were denied the right to vote. We commend the President-elect for his commitment to continuing the political dialogue, including with the separatists in eastern Ukraine. We recall that the Geneva declaration of 17 April provides a good basis for that dialogue. We are also encouraged by the Mr. Poroshenko’s pledge to engage the Russian Federation in talks. We are equally encouraged by the willingness of the Russian Federation to engage in dialogue with the new Ukrainian leadership. In that regard, we reiterate our support for the Secretary-General and his good offices, aimed at finding a political and diplomatic solution to the crisis. We are convinced that he will seize the momentum to achieve a breakthrough with the support with the parties concerned.
Meanwhile, the continuing violence in the east, especially around the city of Donetsk, where a fierce battle for control of the airport took place, is alarming. We are also concerned about the killing of journalists and the abduction of international monitors representing the OSCE. We take note of the release of 11 monitors and call for the immediate release of the remaining four monitors who were abducted on Monday. We urge all armed protesters to disarm and respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.
Rwanda recognizes the legitimate right of the Government of Ukraine to restore law and order in the east and on the whole territory of Ukraine, as was reaffirmed by the President-elect. However, we call on the Ukrainian authorities to exercise that right in a proportionate manner, bearing in mind that the only sustainable way out of the crisis is through a political and inclusive dialogue as well as constitutional reforms aimed at further decentralization and the promotion of equality and rights of minorities, including cultural and linguistic rights.
Let me conclude by saying that the Ukrainian presidential elections of last Sunday were a turning point, as they have provided the country with a legitimate leader who has enough political capital to make peace among Ukrainians and to in the region. We call on the international community, particularly the United Nations, the European Union, the OSCE and the Russian Federation, to support the new leadership in that political and diplomatic process. ","I thank Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing on the latest developments in Ukraine and the status of the issues being dealt with by the good offices of the United Nations. Argentina continues to follow the situation in Ukraine very closely and remains concerned by the developments in the eastern regions of the country.
With regard to the election process of last Sunday, Argentina, as a matter of principle and of general policy, does not comment on the results of elections, which are by their very nature under the exclusive jurisdiction of each State. We reiterate that due respect must be paid to Ukraine’s conduct of its internal affairs, without any type of interference or intervention, be it military, political or economic, in matters that are under its own jurisdiction. Argentina respects the decision of the people of Ukraine.
We have repeatedly emphasized the need to establish conditions conducive to restarting the urgent dialogue process. We hope that the presidential elections held on 25 May will contribute to that and to a decrease in tensions by decreasing the risk of new violent confrontations and decreasing the spiral of violence, which if it continues, would have severe repercussions on the stability not only of Ukraine, but also the region. The actions of armed groups, unilateral actions and the human rights violations and abuses will only deepen the crisis and put the security and living conditions of the civilian population at risk.
We are concerned about reports of the disappearance of four members of the international observers team of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, who have not been heard from since Monday. In that connection, we call on all parties concerned to take every possible step to ensure that the observers are immediately released unharmed. In particular, Member States with influence on the parties should bring positive pressure to bear to that end.
We are convinced that the only solution to the crisis in Ukraine is political and diplomatic. Therefore, we reiterate our call on all parties to exercise maximum self-restraint and contribute to a constructive dialogue. In that vein, the effective implementation by all parties of the measures agreed on in Geneva continues to be necessary to making progress in a dialogue process, which will encourage confidence between the various communities and assure all Ukrainians throughout the country that their main concerns and rights will be cared for.
Any violation or abuse of human rights is unjustifiable. The cases of killings, torture, abduction, harassment, illegal detention and intimidation must be investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice. We therefore call on all the national and regional authorities of Ukraine to take effective steps not only to prevent human rights violations and protect human rights, but also to ensure that all security forces respect those rights.
Once again, we reaffirm that the international community should, on the one hand, focus its efforts on ensuring that the parties enter a constructive dialogue with full respect for human rights, international humanitarian law and respect for the rights of all minorities and, on the other, act strictly within the framework of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, with the objective of achieving domestic peace in the country and creating a climate conducive to sustainable, inclusive and prosperous development.","I too would like to thank the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, , Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, for his intervention.
Luxembourg welcomes the holding on 25 May of the presidential election, during which the Ukrainian people expressed their will. The election featured a high voter turnout and a clear willingness on the part of the authorities to organize a genuine election, conducted largely in line with international commitments and with respect for fundamental freedoms. In the vast majority of the country’s regions the election passed off under good conditions. Despite the hostile security climate, voting was held successfully in 9 of 22 and 2 of 12 electoral districts in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk respectively. Despite the situation in eastern and southern Ukraine, including Crimea, participation was generally high. The election observation mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), in which Luxembourg has been an active participant, gave the conduct of the election an initial generally positive assessment.
The success of this elесtiоп is due first and foremost to the citizens of Ukraine. Their choice was clear. They voted for a united, stable Ukraine enjoying full sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Luxembourg condemns the violence that has gone on for several weeks, particularly in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where several towns and administrative buildings remain under the control of separatist armed militias. We are concerned about the numerous cases of killings, torture, beatings, kidnappings — especially of journalists — committed by well-armed and well-organized anti-Government groups.
We also condemn in the strongest terms the abduction of 15 observers deployed with the OSCE’s special observation mission in the Donetsk region. We welcome the release today of the 11 observers who had been arrested, but we remain concerned about the fate of the four observers who have been missing since Monday. They should be released safe and sound, immediately and unconditionally.
At this crucial moment for democracy in Ukraine, we call on Russia to translate into action its declarations of respect for the will of the Ukrainian people. As the Heads of State and Government of the European Union said yesterday, we expect the Russian Federation to cooperate with the new, legitimately elected President, to continue withdrawing armed forces from the Ukrainian border and to use its influence with the armed separatists to calm the situation in eastern Ukraine. Russia should give priority to preventing the movement of separatists and arms in Ukraine.
Ukrainians have given a strong mandate to President-elect Poroshenko, who must now commit to resolving the crisis through the rule of law and dialogue initiated by the Ukrainian Government. In that context, we commend the holding of three round tables organized by the Government, with OSCE support, in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. We encourage the Ukrainian authorities to use the legitimacy of the newly elected President to pursue this national dialogue with the general public and civil society in every region of Ukraine.
The Ukrainian Parliament’s adoption on 20 May of the memorandum for peace and harmony, which identifies priorities in the area of decentralization and guarantees of respect for the status of the Russian language, is an important step in the right direction. Prompt constitutional reform towards decentralization, which should unite all parties, while benefiting from the Council of Europe’s expertise in that area, is a key aspect of that process. The rights of national minorities must be fully respected, in accordance with the rules in force at the Council of Europe. We reaffirm our commitment to the Geneva statement of 17 April. We commend the role of the OSCE special observer mission in contributing to the implementation of that statement, as well as the efforts of the Ukrainian authorities in that direction. We again call on the Russian Federation to take steps to fully implement the joint statement. We unreservedly support the additional efforts of the OSCE and its Chairman-in-Office, given that Ukrainians must have ownership of the process.
We support the good offices of the Secretary-General and his team. We strongly hope that, with the consistent and joint support of the international community, the holding of the presidential election on 25 May and the selection of a new President with unquestionable legitimacy will make it possible for Ukraine to start afresh and emerge from a crisis that has lasted too long. The citizens of Ukraine aspire to democracy, the rule of law, peace and prosperity. Their choice, like the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and independence of Ukraine, must be respected.","I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the Republic of Korea.
My delegation thanks Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman, for his briefing. The Republic of Korea congratulates Ukraine on holding successful presidential elections on 25 May. We are pleased to note that the elections were carried out in a fair and transparent manner, with a high turnout, despite the challenging security environment in the eastern part of the country. We believe that the election represents a step forward in the de-escalation of tensions.
In the light of that, we call on all sides to respect the results of the election and cooperate with the newly elected President and his Government. At the same time, we condemn election-related violence by illegal armed groups, including the forced closure of the district election commission and the intimidation of election officials.
We hope that the Ukrainian Government will now take this invaluable opportunity to lead an inclusive and transparent constitutional process that reflects the interest of all Ukrainian people, including minorities. In that regard we welcome President-elect Petro Poroshenko’s announced plan to visit the eastern regions and to pursue cooperative solutions with all sides. In addition, the series of round tables as part of the national dialogue is also a welcome development. We believe it is essential to any sustainable solution to the crisis.
Despite the positive steps, we remain deeply concerned over the continuing escalation of tensions in eastern Ukraine, including the recent fighting between the armed separatist groups and Ukrainian security forces. We are also concerned over abductions of members of the OSCE monitoring mission near Donetsk. The safety and security of the members of the missions must be fully guaranteed.
In conclusion, I would like to highlight that the stability and prosperity of Ukraine is critical not only to peace in Europe but also to the international community. We once again reaffirm our full support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.
I now resume my functions as President of the Council.
I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine. "
S/PV.7167,41675,Political instability in the South and East of Ukraine as well as the military escalation in the Donbas area,"I wish to congratulate the Republic of Korea on its assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month and to express appreciation to the Ambassador of Nigeria and her team for their outstanding leadership of the work of the Council last month. I also wish to thank Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Feltman for his briefing. In recent days, the situation in some areas in south-eastern Ukraine has been characterized by ongoing tensions and escalation that have resulted in casualties. That is a matter of deep concern to China. China has indicated on many occasions its principled position on the question of Ukraine. We hope that the parties concerned will proceed from the need to safeguard the fundamental interests of various ethnic groups in Ukraine, maintain regional peace and stability, keep calm, exercise restraint and avoid further deterioration of the situation. A political solution is the only way out of the crisis in Ukraine. A fundamental settlement to the crisis in Ukraine needs to take into consideration the history and the reality, and accommodate the legitimate rights, interests and aspirations of various regions and ethnic groups within Ukraine, as well as the legitimate concerns of all parties, so as to achieve a balance of their interests. For some time, various parties, including China, have worked actively to promote peace and facilitate negotiations. The four-party talks in Geneva among the Russian Federation, the United States, the European Union and Ukraine agreed on the need to take measures to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine. We hope that the parties concerned will stick to dialogue and consultations, effectively implement the agreements reached, forcefully promote the process of political settlement and achieve stability and development in Ukraine as soon as possible. China calls on all parties to seek a political settlement to the question of Ukraine through dialogue, not confrontation. We will continue to support international good offices that will help to de-escalate the situation and promote a political settlement.","I pay tribute to the Permanent Representative of Nigeria and her team in their presidency of the Council for last month. Here we are once again, meeting to address the crisis in Ukraine. Each time, the Council flaunts its divisions and hence its powerlessness while that unhappy country sinks into anarchy. Let us return to the facts. In eastern Ukraine, armed groups are gradually seizing the cities. They enjoy no crowds of supporters other than a few hundred demonstrators. Their heavy weaponry disqualifies them as mere sympathetic activists. Russian officers strut on local television. Observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and journalists have been taken hostage. Numerous people have been detained; more seriously, increasingly credible allegations are surfacing of enforced disappearances, killings and torture. These thugs have refused to implement the Geneva agreement that was intended to restore the Ukrainian State on its territory. What has Ukraine done? After showing a restraint that no other State would have exhibited in the presence of these attacks on its authority — attacks that have been organized, supported and justified by a neighbour — it decided to use its army and police against the armed gangs spreading a sense of insecurity at the expense of people most of whom do not support them. These gangs have so little in common with the spontaneous coalescence of local groups that they were able to shoot down a helicopter with a surface-to-air missile — which, it must be acknowledged, is not commonly found at the Kharkiv market. By what right would anyone meddle in the internal affairs of a State that is only seeking to restore its violated sovereignty? At the bilateral level, we can recall the need to act with restraint, but so far there is no evidence that it has not done so. Going any further would be to violate the Charter of the United Nations. I know that reality has left that scenario far behind. Having trampled the principle of the territorial integrity of States, the same can be done to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States. After all, in sin, it is only the first step that bears a cost, as the moralists say. Russia has proven that by renouncing, one after the other, the principles underlying international life. But it still has a few regrets as it spirals downwards, so it tries, against all credibility, to blame the other. It invokes the agreement of 21 February, which it did not endorse and discovered only when it was too late. It brandishes the Geneva agreement, for the achievement of which it made no effort. Lastly, it makes accusations that would be comical under different circumstances: the Nazis are in Kyiv, English speakers have infiltrated the ranks of Ukrainians — which makes me jealous that no French speakers are included — and, finally, the European Union is responsible for the violence. No, the facts are much more simple. In reality, Russia has opened a Pandora’s box. They have let the demon of nationalism escape. They have unleashed bands of thugs on Ukraine. The only alternatives they are offering Kyiv are capitulation or partition — and they are suddenly discovering that this mixture can go completely out of control; that nationalism can oblige them to do what they do not want to do; that the thugs act like thugs and, finally, that Ukraine, faced with the impossible choice they wish to impose on it, can hit back. At that point, the fire-starting firefighters shriek loudly to try to make us forget that in fact it was them who chose this road, and that it is Russia who should retreat. For our part, we have been saying for weeks that we are seeking a de-escalation — we want a de-escalation. But de-escalation implies that Russia will calm the armed groups it is equipping and training; that it will see that the OSCE observers are freed — having still not publicly condemned their capture in the first place — and open negotiations with Ukraine; that free elections will be held on 25 May under international supervision in order to give the Kyiv authorities indisputable legitimacy; and that negotiations begin between Russia and Ukraine. Compromises are possible. Ukraine is aware of the stakes and is ready, and the countries of Europe, the most closely concerned in this crisis, are too. Constitutional reform that responds to the concerns of the people of eastern Ukraine and respects Ukraine’s sovereignty is quite conceivable. But for that to happen, we have to put an end to this bad spy thriller, in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs is replaced by an information service when a crisis has to be resolved. What we need today is not a vodka-loving James Bond but diplomats who can return to the principles that form the foundations of international life.","The Russian delegation called for today’s emergency meeting of the Security Council with a view to considering the resumed punitive military operations undertaken by the authorities of the Kyiv regime, involving terrorists, the pro-fascist Right Sector and other ultranationalist organizations against their own people in south-eastern Ukraine. A sub-unit of the Ukrainian army is using tanks, other heavy artillery and military helicopters to launch rocket striles against protesters and land troops. The first blood has already been spilled and reports are coming in about the killed and wounded. If the criminal misadventures of the Kyiv clique are not swiftly stopped, a catastrophic outcome for Ukraine cannot be averted. We have warned of this on many occasions. Punitive measures against its own people bear witness to the current Kyiv Government’s inability or unwillingness to fulfil its obligations under the Geneva declaration of 17 April to ensure a speedy end to all violence and the launch of broad national dialogue, with the participation of all regions and political forces. If anyone entertained any doubts, it is now clear that the many statements of the so-called Government of Ukraine regarding its intention to begin nationwide dialogue in the search of settlement to the far-reaching crisis are nothing but hypocrisy. The regime in Kyiv, having abrogated the agreement of 21 February, is now openly violating its commitments under the Geneva declaration of 17 April, which require an urgent measures to end to all violence. In essence, at a time when Russia is striving to de-escalate and settle the crisis and — at the request of our Western partners and in cooperation with the leadership of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) — recently sent a representative of the President of the Russian Federation to Donetsk oblast in order to find a solution to the situation of the military specialists from several European countries, the Kyiv regime, with the support of its Western sponsors, has launched the full-scale use of military force, effectively annihilating any prospects for the implementation of the Geneva agreement. We are particularly concerned about information that, in the course of the punitive operations undertaken by the Ukrainian armed forces and illegal ultranationalist groups, English has been heard being spoken on the radio and English-speaking foreigners have been identified among those attacking in Sloviansk. We insist that all outside interference in the events in Ukraine is unacceptable. It is time for our Western colleagues to think twice, reason with their mentees in Ukraine, and stop toying with the destiny of the Ukrainian people to determine their own geopolitical goals. How else can we interpret yet another blatant example of the double standards wielded by the United States? Following the numerous attempts of Washington, D.C., to tell Russia where and how its military should be properly deployed in its own territory, the White House has now been offended by our appeal to the Kyiv Government to withdraw its forces from eastern Ukraine. I recall that Washington, D.C., used frequently to ask former President Yanukovich of Ukraine not to use force against his people, and threatened him with all sorts of consequences. Now, however, in a strange twist of logic, force may and must be used against civilians by a Government that enjoys no legitimacy. The High Representative of the European Union is not far behind her United States colleagues, philosophizing about the State’s monopoly on the use of force. In the current context in Ukraine, her statement can only be characterized as provocative and inflammatory. It would seem that not only did the High Representative not participate in signing the Geneva declaration, but that she did not read it. In helping those who organized the coup d’état in Kyiv to crush the protesters, the United States and the European Union bear great responsibility for effectively destroying the path to a peaceful solution to the crisis. Against that backdrop, the categorical refusal of Washington, D.C., to support the continuation of dialogue between the representatives of Kyiv and of south-eastern Ukraine, under the auspices of the OSCE, would hardly seem coincidental in its contravention of the Geneva declaration fo 17 April. What could be a more striking example than the fact that the United States is bent on the use of force? We call on Kyiv, its enablers and the signers of the Geneva declaration, the United States and the European Union, not to commit a fatal error and to make a sober assessment at all possible consequences of their actions. We call firmly on the West to end its destructive policy concerning Ukraine, and on the self-proclaimed authorities in Kyiv to swiftly halt all punitive operations and other measures against the people, free political prisoners and guarantee full freedom for journalists. That would represent a genuine process of de-escalation. There is a need for the urgent organization of authentic and equitable political dialogue, with the participation of all regions, to reach mutual agreement on the future of the country, rather than pretend to draft reforms within the small circle of self-styled Government of winners. Those who gave the criminal order to unleash bloodshed will bear full responsibility for whatever happens in Ukraine. Our encyclopedically educated and eloquent French colleague inserted an interesting quotation in his statement, to the effect that when we sin, it is only the first step that carries a cost, and the subsequent ones are easier. Indeed, we can find affirmations of his words of wisdom in the history of the still young twenty-first century. Among other things, the twenty-first century has presented humankind and international relations with the gift of practices such as enforced regime change, done in an attempt to impose someone’s geopolitical vision on other countries of the world. It is very clear that every such attempt launched early in the twenty-first century has resulted in terrible destabilization. But, having taken that first step, the people who made those attempts have nonetheless been unable to stop and have gone on with them. This time that has led to serious destabilization in Ukraine. I would like to remind the Council that, during the several months of crises preceding the overthrow of the lawful administration between 21 and 25 February, our Western colleagues never once called for a halt to the violence perpetrated in Kyiv and other regions of Ukraine against the lawful authorities. There were no calls to President Yanukovych to use every possible means at his disposal as lawful President, including that of force, in order to impose order in the country. But now, for some reason, those calls are coming loud and clear. During this entire crisis, Russia has wanted only one thing, which is to avoid destabilization in Ukraine and settle everything through negotiations. We proposed tripartite talks among Ukraine, the European Union and Russia at the start of the crisis on the political confrontation that focused on whether Ukraine should sign an association agreement with the European Union. For some reason, the European Union, with the support of the United States, rejected our proposal. When the 25 February agreement was reached, we supported it. We still believe that many of the 25 February positions are right, and that they must be kept to if we hope to bring Ukraine out of political crisis. We helped to conclude the 17 April Geneva agreement. It is a simple agreement, but it points to a way out of the crisis in the country. The one thing that is essential is that the agreement be fulfilled. But the most striking and infuriating thing is that the demands of the people of eastern Ukraine are basically fairly simple. Finding themselves in a situation in which the nation’s capital was occupied by an illegitimate authority, to a large degree consisting of hostile nationalist radical elements, the people asked that their rights be guaranteed. They demanded federalization. It was noticeable that for a long period — almost two months after the overthrow of the lawful Government — no one there took up arms for at least a couple of months. They were all waiting for some constructive reaction from Kyiv to their demands for protecting their own interests. Not once did any kind of reasonable reaction or serious initiative emanate from Kyiv. Today some of our colleagues spoke approvingly of the most recent — today or yesterday — pronouncement of Mr. Yatsenyuk, in which he talked about 25 May, for which presidential elections are scheduled, and that there will be some kind of poll on decentralization of the country. A poll. The people have been fighting on the barricades for weeks, and they think they have to conduct a poll in order to figure out people’s opinion about what they want. What bothered me more than anything today was how calmly and approvingly our Western colleagues spoke about the search operations that the Kyiv authorities are now carrying out in eastern Ukraine. They gave the impression that they know what the Kyiv authorities are thinking, what their plans are. Maybe they had a part in drawing up those plans, and that was why they talked about what was going on so calmly. Perhaps that should not be so surprising after all, because, as we know, every visit to Kyiv by senior American officials has resulted in events reaching new levels of confrontation, and a more violent turn of events. In that regard, it is not surprising that the United States, as I said in my statement, did not want the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to do as it was supposed to under the Vienna Document, that is, to bring about dialogue and organize a round table with representative of different regions and the Kyiv Government. Why did the United States not want the OSCE to do that? Throughout the crisis, Russia several times has suggested different formats for the organization of such dialogue between the Government and opposition forces and regions. The Government did not want to or could not do it themselves. We suggested a constitutional assembly be convened. They said they were not ready to do so. When the meeting of 17 April was organized, we suggested that representatives of the regions should be included, and that the four parties — the European Union, the United States and Russia and the acting Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine — could start those talks. But that proposal was rejected. The OSCE was then given the mandate, which it tried to carry out only then to be told it should not. Instead, tanks were brought out to Sloviansk and other cities in the east of the country. Regarding what one colleague said, that Russia is refusing to implement the 17 April Geneva statement, I would repeat that Russia would never refuse to implement any useful document agreed upon during the crisis, including the 21 February agreement. Actually listening to my statement today, one would notice that the political components were quotations from the 17 April document. If we are truly intent on finding a political solution to the crisis in spite of the dramatic events of recent days, then perhaps we might ask the President, the Permanent Representative of Korea, to make a statement following this meeting, stating that the Security Council, in keeping with the 17 April Geneva statement, calls for a swift halt to the violence, including, of course, the use of force in eastern Ukraine, and appeals for the swift and comprehensive implementation of the Geneva statement. If other members would be ready to support such action, then we would too. I did not want to say that a lie cannot only be a distortion of facts, but also a selective interpretation of one’s own position. That is what we have just heard from my American colleague. What we have heard from Washington, D.C., and the way it was heard clearly demonstrated to all — including to those in Kyiv, which is most important — that the United States looked favourably on the forceful change of power, which did not ultimately serve the interests of the Ukrainian people. Regarding my proposal, I do think it would be good to conclude this meeting with such a statement, not asking every delegation what it is going to declare but rather make a joint statement calling for a swift halt to all violence, including the use of military force in the east of the country, and for seriously taking up the full implementation of the Geneva document.","I congratulate the Republic of Korea on its assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of May. I would also like to thank Ambassador Ogwu and the Nigerian team for their admirable stewardship of the Council in April. Thank you for convening this meeting, Mr. President. The Russian Federation has described this morning’s events in eastern Ukraine as a punitive military operation against peaceful activists. This is yet again a gross distortion of the facts. The Ukrainian Government has the right, and indeed the responsibility, to uphold the rule of law and protect its citizens in its own territory. Of course, in doing so it should at all times act in a proportionate and measured way. The actions undertaken this morning by Ukrainian security forces in and around Sloviansk appear to have been just that, in an effort to relieve the city from the armed groups, sponsored and controlled by Russia, that have been terrorizing the local population. We urge them to continue to make every effort to ensure that the risks to civilians are minimized. But let us be absolutely clear. There is no Council member sitting around this table that would allow its towns to be overrun by armed militants. None of us would abrogate responsibility for the protection of citizens on our own territory who are being intimidated and brutalized by heavily armed groups backed by a neighbouring country. Proportionate is not the same as passive. The scale of Russian hypocrisy is breathtaking. Russia stoutly supports, and indeed arms, the most repressive regimes in the world, notably Syria, a regime that brutally represses dissent without any sense of restraint or concern for the protection of civilians. Russia’s synthetic indignation over Ukraine’s proportionate and measured actions convinces no one. Russian claims that these are peaceful activists are simply not credible. Peaceful activists do not have the means or the capability to shoot down three Ukrainian military helicopters, reportedly using man-portable air defence systems. The use of such sophisticated weaponry against Ukrainian forces reaffirms our assessment that the armed groups in eastern Ukraine include professionals funded, equipped and directed by Russia. The situation in eastern Ukraine has continued to deteriorate. Armed groups stormed the Prosecutor’s office in Donetsk yesterday, further increasing the number of Government buildings occupied since the 17 April Geneva agreement. We remain seriously concerned about the kidnapping and continued detention of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s Vienna Document inspectors, and call on Russia to condemn this criminal act and use its influence over those who are holding the inspectors to bring about their immediate, safe and unconditional release. We are deeply disturbed by the reports of abductions and intimidation of journalists reporting from eastern Ukraine. The Council discussed the protection of journalists in an open debate last year (see S/PV.7003). One of its clearest conclusions was on the central importance of safeguarding a free media so that facts and truth can be told. Instead, what we are seeing in Ukraine is a torrent of disinformation and propaganda. Three days ago, all the members of the Council emphasized the importance of the 17 April agreement and its implementation (see S/PV.7165). Abiding by that agreement remains the best way to de-escalate the volatile and dangerous situation in eastern Ukraine. It is therefore regrettable that Russia’s presidential press secretary said this morning that Russia did not think it any longer possible to implement the 17 April agreement. Worsening instability in Ukraine is in no one’s long-term interest. We urge Russia to step back from such rhetoric, to desist from its inflammatory propaganda and to commit to de-escalating a perilous situation. We urge Russia to throw its full weight behind the 17 April agreement and rein in the militant armed groups that it supports and that are responsible for the current crisis.","In recent months, the Council has met more than a dozen times regarding the situation in Ukraine. Time and again, we have urged for respect for Ukraine’s territorial integrity, adherence to international law, and steps to reduce tensions and de-escalate the crisis. Just this Tuesday, we met to discuss Russia’s inexcusable failure to fulfil its obligations under the 17 April Geneva agreement (see S/PV.7165). Russia is pushing two monumental falsehoods right now. The first falsehood is that the Ukrainians are carrying out a large-scale, uncontrolled, violent attack on unarmed civilians. That is false. The Ukrainian Government is carrying out a targeted effort to contain Russian-sponsored paramilitary violence emanating from Sloviansk, in an effort to deliver security for Ukrainian citizens. There is horrible violence in eastern Ukraine, and that violence is coming, as it has been for weeks now, from Russian-directed agents and paramilitaries and their associates. The second monumental falsehood is that the Russian Federation is deeply concerned about the instability in the east. The rest of us are deeply and sincerely concerned by that instability. But despite all its rhetoric, Russia cannot be, because Russia is causing the instability. This expressed concern is cynical and disingenuous, and meant only to distract us from the reality that is playing out before our eyes. Today I want to focus on one main point. From the outset, the Government of Ukraine has sought to resolve all issues peacefully through dialogue, both internally and with the Russian Federation. This policy of restraint continued even after Russia subverted Crimea, orchestrated an undemocratic separatist vote in Crimea, invaded Crimea and announced to the world that it had annexed Crimea — while lying about its intentions and even its presence in Crimea every step of the way. As its country has been carved up, as foreign operatives have moved into its homeland, as masses of Russian troops have assembled along its eastern border, and as Moscow has continued to threaten its territorial integrity and its people, Ukraine has continuously, day after day, shown remarkable, almost unimaginable, restraint. It has done as the Council has asked. It has implemented its international agreements. It has refrained from military responses to aggression, even as Russia proudly announced that it had annexed part of Ukraine. Ukraine has over and over again committed and recommitted itself to direct dialogue with Moscow. And yet, in return for Ukraine’s reasonableness, Russia has destabilized, threatened and terrorized. In past weeks, the same scenario that played itself out in Crimea has been repeating itself in parts of eastern Ukraine: the same sudden appearance of unfamiliar men and new armaments; the same strategy of occupying buildings and taking control of the media; the same vicious propaganda directed against the Government of Ukraine and the same denials of Russian involvement; and the same cries of outrage whenever Ukraine takes a step to assert its own rights, enforce its own laws, protect its own citizens and restore order on its own territory. The Ukrainian people and Government have embarked on an effort today to reclaim one city in the eastern part of their country. Their response is reasonable, it is proportional and, frankly, it is what any one of our countries would have done in the face of that threat. Imagine for a moment if 26,000 square kilometres of Russian territory were seized by another country. Would Moscow show restraint, week after week, day after day, in the hopes that rational dialogue rather than brute force would prevail? How would President Putin respond, if parts of his country were seized, to requests to remove his army from those parts of the country? Seriously, there is some irony in Russian demands, given the manner in which it would deal with separatism within its borders. It has been 63 days since Russia began its campaign to annex Crimea, and for 63 days, day after day, the Ukrainian Government has chosen peace. Yet in those same 63 days, Russia, day after day, has chosen to pursue more territory. Consider the following facts. Pro-Russian separatists have seized the Donetsk railway control centre and stopped almost all train movements. That is an illegal act. Separatists seized control of the Donetsk General Prosecutor’s office, in a violent clash that left more than two dozen people hospitalized. That is an illegal act. Separatists seized the General Prosecutor’s office in Horlivka. That is an illegal act. Pro-Russian activists beat up two Radio Svoboda journalists who were filming a protest near the Kharkiv regional administration building on 1 May. That is an illegal act. We could go on and on and on and on about the illegal acts. All told, in 17 towns in eastern Ukraine 32 buildings are under occupation, 21 by armed personnel. In addition, we have seen dozens of Ukrainian public officials illegally detained, three bodies pulled from a river near Donetsk and a group of eight, now seven, monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) abducted, in direct defiance not simply of Ukraine’s Government but of the Council and the world community. Alongside all of that action, we have heard the Russian Federation building its case for intervention — outright intervention — including President Putin saying that eastern Ukrainian cities and Odessa were not even part of Ukraine in the “good old days”, harkening back to the glory of Novorossiysk. And Ambassador Churkin has taken the United Nations Charter’s name in vein by invoking Article 51 in self-defence, as activated during the Russian takeover of parts of Georgia and relevant here in the context of the crisis in eastern Ukraine. The country that has a right of self-defence, Ambassador Churkin, is Ukraine. Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine is a clear violation of international law, and Russia fools no one by calling its troops “peacekeepers”. Unfortunately, Russia does have a track record of using the term “peacekeeping” as cover for unlawful military intervention and occupation without authorization from the Security Council. There is no evidence that the Ukrainian Government has targeted Russian nationals or threatened Russia in any way, in stark contrast to the ongoing Russian actions to destabilize eastern Ukraine. If Russia thinks peacekeeping forces are required in Ukraine, it should come to the Security Council and seek United Nations peacekeepers. Those separatists are not engaged in peaceful protest on behalf of their rights. Their rights are not being threatened. Their ability to use their language and have it recognized by the Government is not being threatened. Their ability to participate fully as voters and citizens is not being threatened. It is their methods that have been intentionally provocative and threatening. The separatists are not pressing their case peacefully. They are using baseball bats, metal bars, clubs and knives. Those are not activists, they are armed operatives. It must stop. Since the beginning of the crisis, the Ukrainian Government has acted in good faith and with admirable restraint. The area around Kyiv City Hall is now clear of all Maidan barricades and protesters. Over the Easter holiday, Ukraine voluntarily suspended its counter-terrorism initiative, choosing to de-escalate, despite its fundamental right to provide security on its own territory and for its own people. Even today, as a it tries to lawfully restore order, Ukrainian security forces are operating in a cautious and restrained manner. Unlike the separatists, Ukraine has cooperated fully with the OSCE special monitoring mission and allowed its observers to operate in regions about which Moscow had voiced concerns regarding the treatment of ethnic Russians. In addition, Prime Minister Yatsenyuk has publicly committed his Government to undertake far-reaching constitutional reforms that will strengthen the power of the regions. He has appealed personally to Russian-speaking Ukrainians, pledging to support a special status for the Russian language and to protect those who use it. He announced legislation to grant amnesty to those who surrendered arms. The fact that Ukraine has now taken some steps to try to restore order is to be expected. It is justified. It is what each and every one of the States we represent would do in a similar situation, and would probably have done far earlier. The fact that Russia has chosen to call an emergency meeting in protest is yet another indication that the authorities in Moscow either underestimate the intelligence of the world community or that they are trying to exactly replicate in eastern Ukraine the charade that they were responsible for in Crimea. We are outraged by that prospect, but we are not fooled. Just as Russia and its pro-Russian militia allies engage in a dramatic and dangerous campaign in eastern Ukraine, the Russian Government is spreading some of its most wild propaganda and fantasy stories since the beginning of the crisis. Over the course of the aggression, some of those entrusted with carrying out the functions of the municipal Government and those reporting impartially on the facts have begun to slowly disappear. Local council members, local police and journalists are missing and being held by armed operatives. International observers from the Vienna Document observation team, as the Council knows, are being held in hostage. Those who have an interest and a mandate to report on the truth are being silenced, and that silence is being filled with relentless Russian propaganda and fiction that, it seems, they hope will justify whatever actions they decide to take. Today’s Russian Foreign Ministry ridiculous and false statement purporting Western intervention would not be so alarming if it did not suggest that Moscow is looking for nothing short of a pretext to invade. Russia may have the power to instigate fear, to spread lies and to sow discord, violence and disarray across its border. It may even have the power to abuse its veto at the Security Council. But, as we have said in the Chamber before, it cannot veto the truth. These are dangerous days for Ukraine and for all of us. If there is hope to de-escalate, Russia must pull back its troops from the eastern border of Ukraine, it must cease its campaign of instability inside of Ukraine, and it must work to release the international observers and journalists who have been taken by armed men working on behalf of Moscow’s agenda. Over the past 63 days, in the face of aggression and annexation, the Council implored the Ukrainians to demonstrate restraint, and they heeded our call. We also asked Russia to stop invading its neighbour. Sadly, it did not. For that, Russia must be held accountable. In conclusion, I reiterate the support of my Government for the principles of the United Nations Charter. We continue to support the scheduled 25 May elections, which will enable the people of Ukraine to choose their leaders freely and fairly. We continue to seek a peaceful, democratic, inclusive and united Ukraine. We remain committed to a diplomatic process. Finally and most urgently, we call on Russia to cease its provocative acts and to fulfil the Geneva commitments from which it has walked away.I would just like to offer a couple of points in response. First, for the Russians to blame Ukraine for Ukraine’s actions in defence of its own people on its own territory really is starting to remind me of the story of the schoolboy who returned home with his nose bloody and his shirt torn and, asked by his mother how the fight started, he said “it started when the other boy hit me back”. We have to be clear about cause and effect here, and many Council members, including me, have already gone through the facts that have brought us to this point. My second point is to debunk yet another of the lies that have been told in this Chamber, because it relates to my country, the United States. People in this Chamber have heard many times, including just now, that the United States and other countries never called on protesters in the Maidan to leave buildings or avoid violence. The implication is that we are holding Russian separatists to a different standard. That is a claim that has been made in almost every meeting we have had. I would just like to correct the record. On 15 January, we condemned the actions of rioters outside a Kyiv court building on 10 January. On 22 January, the aggressive actions of members of the extreme-right group Pravy Sektor were unacceptable, enflaming conditions on the streets and undermining the efforts of peaceful protesters. We condemned the targeted attacks against journalists and unofficial groups such as Titushky. On 24 January, when protesters occupied some regional administration buildings, we reiterated our call for all protesters and Government forces to refrain from violence and the destruction of property. On 27 January, we made clear that we condemned the use of violence to seize Government buildings, such as the takeover of a Ministry of Justice building that took place over the past cople of days and of a public exhibition hall that weekend, and continued to reiterate our call for all protesters and Government forces to refrain from violence and the destruction of property. Those are just a few of the statements that we made, but if we could just take that particular lie of the table, it would be helpful and a little more constructive. What is more important now is where we go from here. What I would ask my Russian colleague is whether Russia will make public statements and work privately behind the scenes to urge Russian separatists to negotiate peacefully their departure from public buildings. Where does Russia assess that Russian separatists who claim loyalty to the Russian Government and who wear uniforms just like those of Russian soldiers obtained weapons and training capable of shooting down Ukrainian helicopters? Finally, Russia repeatedly takes aim at the so-called illegitimate Government in Kyiv but refuses to acknowledge ever, in any meeting, that it did not embrace the 21 February agreement when it was negotiated. We have a golden opportunity on 25 May for the people of eastern Ukraine to have their voices heard, for them to choose their own leaders and for us to get to a universally legitimate Government that is respected and chosen by all of the people of Ukraine. Yet Russia will not come out in support of the elections and work with us to ensure that they take place — which would be the best way of ensuring rights, representativeness and greater autonomy for the people of eastern Ukraine.",,,,,,,,,,,"Let me start by congratulating you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of May. We wish you every success in fulfilling that duty. We also want to thank the Nigerian delegation for its successful presidency last month. I would also like to extend our thanks to the Security Council delegations for their support of, and solidarity with, the Government and the people of Ukraine. I also thank Mr. Feltman for his briefing today.
Ukraine remains committed to the implementation of the agreements reached at the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the European Union and the United States in Geneva on 17 April. Free and fair presidential elections on 25 May remain a top priority of the Government of Ukraine.
We reject all attempts by Russia to blame the Government of Ukraine for allegedly failing to implement the agreements. We wouldl ike to say that, despite numerous calls by the international community, the Russian Federation has made no efforts to de-escalate the situation and implement the Geneva agreement. Instead, Russia strongly supports illegal militant groups operating in the eastern region of Ukraine, endangering civilians, seizing hostages and creating an atmosphere of terror and violence.
Security, as well as the protection of the rights and fundamental freedoms of all the people of Ukraine, remains a top priority for the Government of Ukraine. Therefore, the purpose of the counter-terrorist operation, the active phase of which has been renewed in Sloviansk, is to isolate illegal militants from the civilian population of the city. The commander of the counter-terrorist operation has ordered the heavily armed illegal militants to immediately free all hostages, including monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, to evacuate all seized administrative buildings and to stop the violence and massacres. The Ukrainian authorities are ready to provide amnesty to all those members of militant groups who have not committed serious crimes. Inclusive political dialogue with peaceful protesters remains a top priority for the Ukrainian Government.
We officially state that no tanks or missiles are used against civilians. Russian statements about the participation of non-governmental armed groups in the counter-terrorist operation are not true. Russian statements as to the involvement of English-speaking foreigners are absolutely cynical and false. We officially state that the only foreign military personnel in eastern Ukraine are Russian saboteurs and mercenaries.
The Ukrainian side, as well as the Russian Embassy in Kyiv, was not duly informed about today’s arrival in Ukraine of Vladimir Lukin, the so-called representative of the Russian President whose mission is, as he says, to contribute to the liberation of the hostages taken in eastern Ukraine. Despite the circumstances of Mr. Lukin’s arrival, and taking into account the highest priority that the Ukrainian Government attaches to the release of all hostages held by illegal militants, we are ready to discuss with Mr. Lukin, as with other interested mediators, his practical contribution in order to resolve the problem.
I would like to remind the Council that, due to the particularly dangerous situation in Sloviansk, in accordance with our 2003 law on combating terrorism, Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council has taken the decision to launch a large-scale counter-terrorism operation. Owing to increasing threats to the civilian population, this morning the active phase of that counter-terrorism operation was renewed in the area of the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, where units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the National Guard and the Ukrainian Border Service were engaged. The counter-terrorist operation is being implemented exclusively by the law-enforcement agencies of Ukraine.
At the moment, nine terrorist checkpoints have been taken under the control of Ukrainian law-enforcement agencies in Sloviansk. The illegal militants, many of whom are foreign mercenaries, are using heavy firearms against the Ukrainian special forces. They have shot down two Ukrainian helicopters with rocket-propelled grenades, man-portable air defence system guided missiles and anti-aircraft guns. Two officers have been killed and seven wounded. The terrorists do not hesitate to use members of the local peaceful population as human shields. The brutal tactic of firing from residential buildings is used widely in Sloviansk by the terrorists, who are very well aware of the Government instructions to its law-enforcement agents not to answer fire coming from residential buildings.
I would also like to mention that this evening there were also attempts to break through the State border by groups of armed Russian saboteurs, who were stopped by our guards. That is why we call on our Russian partners to immediately stop supporting all the illegal militants on Ukraine’s territory and other actions aimed at undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of my country.
In conclusion, I would like to cite the statement made today by Mr. Oleksandr Turchynov, Acting President of Ukraine. He said that Ukraine demands that terrorist saboteurs and all those who have taken up arms in our country lay down their weapons and surrender their hostages and occupied administrative buildings. Those who lay down their arms and are not involved in serious crimes will be given amnesty, but those accused of murder and torture will be punished. Ukraine, he said, would secure peace and stability in spite of all the efforts to organize acts provocation and unrest aimed at destabilizing the situation in the east and and south of the country, particularly in Kharkiv and Odessa. He said that he would also like to appeal to the leadership of the Russian Federation to end the hysteria about the events taking place in Ukraine and to cease its threats and intimidation. If it is concerned about violations of citizens’ rights, it should protect them in its own country, where human rights are systematically violated. He also called on Russia to end its acts of provocation against Ukraine and to refrain from using terrorism, sabotage and military threats as a form of pressure on it. Despite all the problems and opposition, he said, peace would be ensured in Ukraine and the terrorist threat in eastern Ukraine would be stopped. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Let me start by congratulating the Korean delegation on its assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of May. I wish you every success during your tenure, Madam. I would also like to express my delegation’s appreciation and gratitude to the outgoing presidency of Nigeria for its wise stewardship of the Council during the month of April. I would also like to thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman for his brief but troubling information.
I would like to return to a question that has been already raised: What would a country do if a group of people in one of its towns decided to break away and declare themselves above the country’s laws and Constitution, arm themselves illegally and attack local Government, administrative and justice buildings and take hostages and practice enforced disappearances, beatings and killings? If such groups were supported by sponsors from abroad and propped up by massive propaganda campaigns demonizing the people and the Government, and if provocations were expanding into other regions of one’s country, would one sit and wait for the country to be decimated, or would one act in the country’s interest, protecting its sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity?
Ukraine has taken belated and highly cautious actions against those who are determined to carve it up and parcel it out. Like any other State represented in this Chamber, it has the right to protect its unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity by all means necessary.
As far as punitive actions go, let us be frank. There were more victims on Thursday in Aleppo after a market bombing by barrel bombs: at least 33 people were killed and many more were wounded. That took place a day after a barrel bomb was dropped by a Government aircraft on an elementary school in another part of the city, killing at least 20 other people, including 17 children. Russia has so far not condemned that punitive act by the Al-Assad regime, like countless similar acts by the regime in the course of more then three years of ongoing war in that country.
Today in eastern Ukraine, two Ukrainian helicopters were shot down by mobile air defence systems, killing two military officers and injuring seven others. Another army helicopter was also damaged. Militants used grenade launchers and portable air defence systems. Peaceful protesters do not use grenade launchers that can shoot down helicopters, or perhaps planes at some time in the future. Peaceful protesters do not take their morning walks armed with heavy weapons and automatic weapons. They do not kidnap and shamelessly parade international observers. Today provocations and instigations are being carried out in yet another city in Ukraine, as our Australian colleague has mentioned, and there have now been deaths in Odessa.
Had the separatists respected and carried out the Geneva statement, had they not taken up arms against their own State in the first place, none of that would be happening. It would not be happening had Russia, the only Power with real influence on the separatists, denounced such acts of aggression and called on the separatists to accept a peaceful path of talks with the central Government. Instead, Russia chose to continue to put the blame on Ukraine, the only side that is actually taking some steps — at gunpoint — to implement the Geneva statement.
In addition to the various initiatives that were referred to a couple of days ago during the Council’s open briefing (see S/PV.7165) — an amnesty law, a limitation of presidential powers, decentralization — Ukraine’s Prime Minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, has now announced that the Government will submit a draft law to the Parliament on a referendum on national unity, territorial integrity and decentralization, to be held on 25 May together with the presidential elections. He again stressed that decentralization would grant, in certain territories, additional guarantees to the Russian-speaking population, as well as to members of ethnic minorities.
But I guess that people in eastern and southern Ukraine do not really know that such initiatives even exist, because an aggressive propaganda machine has drowned out the voice of Kyiv, with its alternative narrative of Ukraine’s demonization. They simply will not be allowed to know that viable alternatives exist to the path of war, because that is not in the plans of those who cannot wait to disrupt the 25 May elections and proceed with Ukraine’s dismemberment, under false referendums, the so-called “will of the people” or any sham pretext still in use by pro-Russian militants and their State sponsors. And we must very carefully watch on 11 May, when the self-proclaimed so-called “people’s mayor” of Donetsk republic is demanding a new referendum be held. I would not be surprised if another request to join Russia follows after that referendum.
My Government condemns all attempts to destroy Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and firmly rejects all Russian attempts to validate its intentions and threats to use armed forces or to send Russian Federation peacekeepers into Ukraine’s territory.
A couple of days ago, we expressed support for the Secretary-General’s initiatives and called for stepping up international mediation efforts. We now welcome the fact that Under-Secretary-General Feltman will be going to the region. We fully stand behind the efforts to de-escalate the situation. We also think, as the representative of Luxembourg has stated, that the international observers who are there to provide unbiased, objective information must be allowed to work across all of Ukraine’s territory, in order to help us all better understand what is happening there, but also to help in de-escalating the situation before it becomes much worse.
The international community must mobilize to prevent the crisis from turning into a real bloodbath. For we have seen, time and again, how deadly, horrifying and inhuman the results of incitement and demonizing the other can be. We have seen it in South Sudan, in the Central African Republic and elsewhere. In a tragic twist of irony, in the middle of Europe two sisterly nations, two Slavic Orthodox nations, may start killing each other, both victims of ruthless manipulation through propaganda, orchestrated by the Kremlin. The Geneva statement is the only thing we have on the table now. We should go back to it. We hae to let it work. It is in the interests of all of us. ","I want to thank you, Madam President, for accepting to shepherd the Security Council in the month of May. My delegation wishes you green pastures.
I thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his update. The delicate nature of the situation in Ukraine impels us to urge great circumspection by the contending parties in order to avoid a degeneration of the crisis into full-blown military confrontation. That consideration is even more pertinent today, as developments on the ground have assumed an anarchical dimension. The reported downing of two Ukrainian military helicopters yesterday and the seizure of a local railway control centre near Donetsk by unidentified armed groups amplify our concerns. The brazen takeover and control of public establishments by armed groups has led to the recent response by the Government of Ukraine. We acknowledge the responsibility of the Government to maintain public order and the rule of law. It is also possible to restore public order in a measured manner to avoid degeneration into a full-blown conflict.
Our call on all parties to de-escalate tensions could not be more urgent. We reiterate our position that the outcome of the Geneva meeting of 17 April among Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the European Union and the United States provides the path to the resolution of the conflict. There are, however, prerequisites to that. All sides must refrain from violence, intimidation or provocative action. All armed groups must disarm and vacate illegally seized buildings.
The doors to a diplomatic solution must remain open. The international community, including the United Nations and the relevant regional organizations, must remain engaged and committed to finding a peaceful solution that takes into consideration the interests of all people of Ukraine. We would like to see Ukraine return to peace, security and stability, and its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity respected in accordance with the Charter of United Nations.
The alternative would resemble falling dominoes — not only in the region but in every other region in the world. Perhaps we should all study the domino theory. We would be mortified by what we saw.The current scenario is for us simply mortifying. It is our collective responsibility to prevent the domino theory from being replayed out in our times. ","We would also like to congratulate the Republic of Korea on its assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month. We thank the delegation of Nigeria for all its work as President of the Council last month. And we thank the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, for his briefing.
Jordan would like to express its deep concern about the most recent developments in Sloviansk in the east of Ukraine, in addition to the spillover violence in other regions of the country, including in Odessa. We call upon all parties to demonstrate restraint. We call for a return to calm and for de-escalation and full cooperation with the monitors affiliated with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). We reiterate our appeal for the release of all hostages held by rebels in Sloviansk, including the OSCE monitors.
What is happening today in the east of Ukraine is not civil war, but rather a mutiny. The actions of the rebels, including the ongoing occupation of seized Government buildings, the use of force, the intimidation of civilians and threats to their life and security, are in violation of the law. As Mr. Feltman said, the continuation of those actions runs counter to the letter and spirit of the Geneva agreement signed in April. We reaffirm Ukraine’s right to take appropriate and effective measures to halt violations in the eastern part of the country, preserve its unity and sovereignty, safeguard the security of its citizens and uphold constitutional and legal order.
At the same time, we call upon the Ukrainian Government to work towards a peaceful solution to the crisis and respect international norms in dealing with the situation. It is important to uphold the relevant human rights principles and to spare no effort in immediately engaging in dialogue with stakeholders to reach a peaceful solution. We must not lose the opportunity brought about by the Geneva agreement, which is a guarantee for calm in the east of the country and for preserving the territorial unity of Ukraine. We appeal to the stakeholders to implement the agreement and bring pressure to bear on the rebels to end the crisis.
Rebels and all active stakeholders in Ukraine should refrain from racist or hate speech. There is a need to guarantee a return to stability in the country. We call upon all players to help the Ukrainian authorities in their efforts to guarantee success on the political transition process and to start a comprehensive and direct dialogue with all linguistic groups.
Finally, we underscore the importance of respecting the legitimate aspirations of the Ukrainian people and of working tirelessly to ensure that presidential elections are held within the set time frame in May, in line with those aspirations and while ensuring the future that Ukrainian citizens deserve, within the framework of a comprehensive, effective and lasting political process. ","We would like to congratulate the delegation of the Republic of Korea on its assumption of the presidency of the Security Council. We would like to reiterate our commitment to providing ongoing support towards the success of its stewardship. We also thank the delegation of Nigeria for its excellent work in the presidency during the month of April.
We value the briefing by Under-Secretary-General Feltman.
Since the Council last met to discuss the situation in Ukraine (see S/PV.7165), just three days ago, the crisis has escalated and, once again, we see acts of violence involving separatist groups. The crisis is very quickly entering a dangerous and unpredictable phase. We regret that turn of events and we would like to express our deep concern at the recent events in Sloviansk that had fatal consequences.
The Council must contribute to generating maximum restraint and moderation from the parties. We reiterate our call upon all parties to use all means conducive to finding a peaceful settlement of the crisis through inclusive political dialogue. It is also extremely important that parties focus on a peaceful way out of the crisis through direct political dialogue, that they refrain from acting unilaterally and that they support international mediation efforts, in keeping with General Assembly resolution 68/262. In that context, we reiterate our condemnation of the kidnapping of observers affiliated with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and we reiterate our call for them to be released immediately and without conditions.
Now more than ever, it is vital to work in a spirit of compromise like that which we saw during the Geneva talks on 17 April, which then led to the joint declaration of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, the United States of America, Ukraine and the European Union. That agreement lays out specific steps for reducing tensions and restoring security for all citizens, such as, inter alia, refraining from the use of violence or intimidation, the disarmament of armed groups and the handover of illegally occupied buildings. Once again, we reiterate the need for respecting the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Similarly, we reaffirm the responsibility incumbent on States Members of the United Nations to show restraint in the use of force or the threat thereof against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State.
Chile believes that it is necessary to strengthen the possibilities for a diplomatic solution to be found. To that end, we support the efforts of the Secretary-General and, in particular, we welcome the visit of Under-Secretary-General Feltman to Ukraine and Russia, which at this time Chile believes is the top priority. Chile also believes any further escalation of the crisis should be avoided by entering into dialogue and through confidence-building measures, with a view to contributing to the establishment of an environment conducive to the holding of presidential elections on 25 May. ","I would like to congratulate you, Madam President, on your accession to the presidency of the Council, and I wish you and your entire team every success in your endeavours. I would also like to pay tribute to Mrs. Joy Ogwu and her team for Nigeria’s excellent stewardship of the Council last month. I would also like to thank Mr. Feltman for his briefing.
Despite repeated calls for restraint and for calm, Chad notes with great concern that the situation in eastern Ukraine continues to deteriorate politically and in terms of security and runs the risk of degenerating into a war with incalculable consequences. A number of missions, attempts at arbitration, mediation and other efforts have been undertaken to contribute to de-escalating the situation and to opening the way to dialogue. The results, however, have fallen far short of expectations.
Chad condemns the most recent acts of violence in eastern Ukraine, which have led to a number of deaths and significant material damage. Given the grave situation, Chad reiterates its call for an immediate halt to the fighting and for adherence to non-violence, both by Government forces and the separatists. We also launch an appeal for the release of the seven observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe still being held in detention. We remain convinced that a solution to the Ukrainian problem is necessarily a political. It must be sought in full respect for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and unity of Ukraine and in keeping with the Charter of the United Nations. Chad also reiterates its call for calm, restraint and a de-escalation of the situation. We call on the countries with influence on the parties to use all means possible to establish direct dialogue between the parties. With that in mind, we encourage the international community, especially the Secretary-General, to redouble efforts to bring about a rapprochement between the parties in order to find a peaceful solution to the Ukrainian crisis. ","When we met on 29 April on the situation in Ukraine (see S/PV.7165), we urged Russia to abide by the commitments it made in Geneva on 17 April, including to refrain from violence, intimidation and provocative actions. Since then, as Under-Secretary-General Feltman has just told us, the situation has further deteriorated severely. This planned and coordinated destabilization could not happen without external support. The shooting down of Ukrainian helicopters in Sloviansk today by surface-to-air missiles is dramatic further evidence of that. We are witnessing well-armed, well-trained personnel, using military weapons, who are intent on armed provocation. We have seen further takeover and consolidation of control by armed militia groups over key facilities in cities and towns right across eastern Ukraine, including Donetsk, Kharkiv, Mariupol, Sloviansk and Holivka.Orchestrated violence has today spread to Odessa.
Journalists in eastern Ukraine have been detained. There are kidnappings and torture. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe observers, detained on 25 April, are still being held hostage a week later. That is an affront to the entire international community, and they must be released immediately.
Those actions by pro-Russian groups are clearly not a legitimate protest or an attempt to protect Russian speakers from alleged or spurious threats. They are calculated, cynical and highly provocative actions, obviously designed to undermine Ukrainian State authority, to intimidate and de-stabilize. They make a mockery of what Russia has committed to in the Geneva agreement.
Ukraine itself is working to implement its Geneva commitments. It has submitted to Parliament a draft law and amnesty for protesters who surrender their weapons. It has initiated a process of constitutional reform aimed at decentralizing power. It has committed to holding a broad public debate on possible constitutional change. However, in response to the extreme provocation that Ukraine is facing, Ukrainian authorities have the right and responsibility to seek to reinstate State authority and restore public order over all their territory.
Ukrainian authorities have given clear messages to militant groups as to what is required of them, as Interior Minister Avakov has said: “Free the hostages. Lay down weapons. Vacate administrative buildings, and get municipal infrastructure back to normal”. That has not happened. In these circumstances, it is appropriate and necessary for the Ukrainian Government to take measures to try to ensure security and protect its own citizens in its own territory.
We have seen a statement from Russia’s Foreign Ministry earlier today describing — hypocritically, shamelessly — the policy of those who have supported Ukraine as “destructive”. But what is destructive is Russia’s reckless interference in its neighbour’s affairs — destructive of Ukraine’s stability and territorial integrity, destructive of the Geneva agreement, destructive of regional security, destructive of the Charter of the United Nations and the laws governing relations between countries and destructive of Russia’s own standing and credibility.
We are at a very dangerous, manipulated moment, and Russia must immediately de-escalate the situation, ensure that militia groups desist in their armed rebellion, implement the Geneva agreement and demonstrate, as President Putin has claimed, that it has no further territorial ambitions on Ukraine. That certainly does not appear to be the case. ",,,,"I also thank Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, for his briefing.
The situation in Ukraine has further deteriorated in the past few hours. Ukrainian forces have launched operations against the separatist militants in the eastern part of the city of Sloviansk. The rebels have continued to seize public building in cities in eastern Ukraine, mainly in Sloviansk and Donetsk, where the Prosecutor’s office is even occupied by the militants. They even shot down two Ukrainian helicopters on Friday, killing two crew members. In the meantime, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) military observers are still being illegally detained by separatist militants. We are of course deeply concerned by all those developments, which further deteriorate the already delicate situation in eastern Ukraine. We strongly condemn the violent methods used by armed separatists and we call for a proportionate response by the Ukrainian forces.
However, we should put our full support behind the good offices of the Secretary-General in resolving the crisis in Ukraine. We are happy to hear that Mr. Jeffrey Feltman is going to Ukraine and Moscow. I call upon all Council members to trust him, to trust his envoys and to give them the means and the political backing necessary to conduct a meaningful mediation in Ukraine and the region.
The strongest condemnation of Rwanda or of any other Council member on the deterioration of the crisis will not solve the Ukrainian conflict. We all know that only a genuine dialogue by the Ukrainian parties, on the basis of the 17 April Geneva outcome, and a strong commitment on the part of of those who have influence on them, who need to ensure that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine are preserved, can solve this crisis. Otherwise, the situation will further escalate, the conflict will become regional, or worse, and it would be useless to continue to convene emergency public briefings of the Security Council if the concerned parties and countries are not willing to be responsible and solve the conflict. In that regard, we need to scale down the rhetoric. ","I join other speakers in expressing my confidence, on behalf of the delegation of Argentina, in Korea’s leadership during the month of its presidency. I also express my recognition and gratitude to the Nigerian presidency of last month.I also thank the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Feltman, for his briefing on the situation in Ukraine.
We are meeting for the second time this week to discuss once again the alarming situation in Ukraine, showing that the Security Council has a responsibility to express — and for Argentina, to reiterate — its concern that wide-scale violent confrontations could result from the growing tensions. The alarming reports coming from Solviansk suggest that such confrontations have occurred and that there is a serious risk of entering into a spiral of violence with grave consequences for Ukraine, the region and the international community.
Argentina condemns the acts of violence reported in eastern Ukraine that have claimed human lives. Unfortunately, the calls by the members of the Council, the Secretary-General and the international community on all parties to seek to calm the situation, exhibit the greatest of self-control and to contribute to constructive dialogue have not been heeded. The spirit compromise shown in Geneva has deteriorated rapidly and must be recovered in order to find a political and diplomatic solution to the crisis.
It must be made clear to all parties that a peaceful solution to the difficult situation in Ukraine cannot be achieved through unilateral acts of any sort. It is particularly crucial that all parties fully respect human rights law and international humanitarian law, respect the rights of all minorities and ensure that all actions are strictly within international law. The only solution that Argentina, like the rest of the international community, considers desirable and necessary is that reached through an inclusive national dialogue with the participation of all of the parties involved. However, to launch such a dialogue process and move towards a solution, it is crucial to create conditions conducive to negotiation, build confidence among the various communities and provide assurances to all Ukrainians throughout Ukraine that their main concerns will be addressed, with full respect for Ukraine’s right to see to its internal affairs.
We have witnessed further confrontational rhetoric once again, speeches fomenting hate, discrimination, hostility and violence, and actions that serve only to escalate the already highly volatile situation. All of this seriously undermines any effort by the international community to encourage the parties to enter into constructive dialogue towards a peaceful politico-diplomatic solution to the crisis.
It is therefore crucial that the most influential actors engage in constructive diplomacy, refrain from confrontational rhetoric and use their influence on the parties for progress in the effective implementation of the measures agreed on 17 April in Geneva. Those measures are necessary, indeed indispensable, for de-escalating tensions and finding a way out of the crisis.
Finally, human lives are at stake and regional stability is at risk. Respect for the founding principles of the Charter of the United Nations must be ensured, including the universal principles of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Ukraine. The Security Council has met several times in a short period to address this situation, but we have not manifested the capacity to play a constructive role to find a way out of the crisis. Members’ calls to de-escalate tensions, exercise restraint and pursue dialogue have no effect because they are not coherent. We have not been able to send out a message in a single voice or to take any sort of action. But it is not too late. The worst can still be averted. Perhaps the Council will — it should — be able to send the same message today as the one the Secretary-General made today, in the same terms, in the same spirit and with the same convictions, that is, that we must assume our responsibility to maintain international peace and security. ","I thank the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, for his briefing.
The situation in eastern Ukraine is deteriorating in a worrying manner. Everything must be done so that it does not degenerate into an open conflict with incalculable consequences for international peace and security. We are deeply concerned by the actions of pro-Russian militias separatists supported by Russia, who are clearly trying to destabilize the east of Ukraine and to prevent the holding of presidential elections on 25 May.
Faced with violations of its sovereignty and territorial integrity for two months now, the Ukrainian authorities have demonstrated restraint. They did not respond militarily to the occupation or annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. Until now, the Ukrainian authorities have shown the greatest of restraint in responding to the proliferation of cases of illegal occupation of public buildings by armed militias, the growing number of attacks against Ukrainian security forces and the surge in violence against those demonstrating peacefully in favour of the unity of Ukraine in the east of the country.
We deeply regret that the confrontations today near Sloviansk and during the demonstrations in Odessa have led to deaths and scores of injured, according to media reports. We reiterate our call for the de-escalation of tensions and for restraint on all sides, fully in keeping with the joint statement adopted on 17 April in Geneva by the chief diplomats of Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union. This is no time to tear up that agreement, but to uphold it. The loss of human life over the past few hours could have been avoided if all parties involved had done the necessary to implement the Geneva statement.
As we meet here, the situation on the ground is chaotic. The presence throughout the territory of Ukraine of impartial observers from the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is crucial for establishing the facts and defusing the war-mongering propaganda. Neutral monitoring and reporting of the facts will help create the conditions to de-escalate this dangerous situation. The OSCE special monitoring mission must be able to fully carry out its work to support the de-escalation measures set out in the Geneva statement.
The safety of the international observers deployed across Ukraine must be guaranteed by all of the parties. We take this opportunity to reiterate our strong condemnation of the kidnapping of a team of military inspectors deployed under the OSCE 2011 Vienna Document. We reiterate our call on Russia to continue using all of its influence on the pro-Russian separatists to free, unconditionally and without delay, the seven monitors from OSCE participating States, whom they have been detaining in Sloviansk for one week now, as well as the Ukrainian personnel accompanying them.
Luxembourg continues to believe that a peaceful way out of this crisis can be found. Nothing can replace direct substantive dialogue between Kyiv and Moscow to find a diplomatic solution to the Ukrainian crisis. For that dialogue to take place, we must urgently proceed to the de-escalation of tensions. We hope that Mr. Feltman’s upcoming visit to Moscow and Kyiv will contribute to that. The good offices of the United Nations are needed now more than ever. ","I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the Republic of Korea.
I thank the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, for his briefing.
The Republic of Korea is deeply concerned about the continuing tensions in eastern Ukraine. Despite the agreement reached in Geneva on 17 April, the situation in Ukraine is showing no signs of abating. We are particularly alarmed by the fresh violence that erupted in Sloviansk over night, including violent attacks targeting two Government helicopters by illegal armed groups. We strongly condemn those attacks, which resulted in the death of two Ukrainians. Such instances point to a serious deterioration in the situation. All provocative actions and hostile rhetoric aimed at destabilizing Ukraine must cease immediately.
In the light of the ongoing situation in Ukraine, we reiterate that constructive dialogue among all concerned parties will be the only way to achieve a peaceful solution. In that regard, we call for all parties to the Geneva statement to implement their commitments. We also fully support the Secretary-General’s good offices and diplomatic initiatives. We hope that Under-Secretary-General Feltman’s upcoming visit to Ukraine and Russia will contribute to a de-escalating of tensions on the ground.
With the important elections scheduled in May, it is still all the more important to ensure the environment is conducive to fair and free elections in the country without any intervention or influence by outside forces. We hope that the Ukrainian Government will lead a inclusive and transparent constitutional process.
We once again reaffirm our full support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. I resume now my functions as President of the Council.
I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine. "
S/PV.7165,29/04/2014,Political instability in the South and East of Ukraine as well as the implementation of the Geneva statement,"I wish to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing. The crisis in Ukraine is the result of a complex fabric of historical and contemporary factors. A political solution is the only way to end the crisis. To tackle the crisis at its roots, both the current situation and the historical facts must be considered, taking into account the legitimate rights, interests and demands of the various regions and ethnic communities of Ukraine and the legitimate concerns of all the parties concerned, with a view to achieving a balance of interests for all. For some time now, various parties including China, have been vigorously engaged in mediation efforts and pushing for talks in order to ease the crisis in Ukraine. The Geneva agreement reached between Russia, the United States, the European Union and Ukraine calls for measures to de-escalate the Ukrainian situation, thereby sending a positive signal for a political solution to the crisis. Regrettably, tensions in eastern and south-eastern Ukraine have worsened, with each side more vehemently accusing the other. Threats and sanctions have again replaced dialogue and negotiation. China hopes that all parties concerned will keep in mind the broader picture of regional peace and stability, and the fundamental interests of all ethnic groups in Ukraine, maintain restraint, persevere in dialogue and consultations, effectively implement the agreement already reached by all of the parties and continue to push for a political solution to the crisis so as to achieve stability and development in Ukraine as soon as possible. China’s position on the question of Ukraine remains objective, impartial and responsible. From the very beginning, China has called on all parties to seek a political solution through dialogue rather than confrontation, and we support international mediation efforts conducive to de-escalating the situation and seeking a political solution. China will continue to play a constructive role in mediation efforts and pushing for talks.","I thank Mr. Feltman for his briefing. Since early April, the situation in Ukraine has deteriorated continuously. In several eastern cities, armed militants, acting in a professional and synchronized manner, have taken possession of public buildings. The similarity of the operations that were observed in Crimea is striking. The violence continues. Seven observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were taken hostage on 25 April. They must be released without delay. On Sunday, the mayor of Kharkiv was the target of an attack and is in a serious condition. We are witnessing a subversive operation that has been planned, barely disguised and orchestrated by Russia. Russian special forces do not even hide anymore. Some time ago, our Russian colleague denied their involvement in Crimea, while his President recognized it a few days later. No doubt, he will do the same with respect to current events in Ukraine. France strongly and unequivocally condemns those unacceptable attempts by Russia to destabilize Ukraine. We must halt this course of confrontation and work towards de-escalation. The joint declaration agreed on in Geneva on 17 April by Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union shows the way forward. It calls on all parties to refrain from violence and acts of intimidation or provocation. It provides for the disarmament of illegal armed groups, evacuation of occupied buildings and public places and amnesty for those who lay down their arms, with the exception of individuals with blood on their hands. It is essential that the declaration be implemented by all parties without delay and in good faith, so that the Ukrainian State can re-establish its sovereignty over its territory. The OSCE’s special monitoring mission has been asked to play an important role in implementing those de-escalation measures, and it is essential that it be allowed to act without hindrance. However, since the declaration’s adoption we have seen two distinct attitudes. On the one hand, the Ukrainian Government has shown its good faith in implementing the declaration by drafting an amnesty law, launching the process of constitutional reform and accelerating the dismantling of barricades and armed groups in Kyiv. In that regard, I commend the restraint and composure of the Ukrainian security forces, who have responded appropriately to the repeated destabilizing actions they are dealing with. We can only imagine what any other Government would have done in the face of such provocation on its national territory. On the other hand, the Russian side has complied with none of the 17 April commitments. There has been no condemnation of the separatist actions that have spawned new violence and no call for public buildings to be evacuated. There has been no appeal to the pro-Russian militants to exercise restraint and end their attacks on munitions depots and on their compatriots, some of whom are said to have been tortured, and on journalists as well. Far from condemning those who took the OSCE observers hostage, today Russia is calling the mission’s presence in eastern Ukraine a provocation. However, we sincerely hope that the announcement yesterday of a halt to the Russian military manoeuvres on the Ukrainian border is true and will be the first step in a genuine de-escalation. We are at a turning point. With every moment that passes, the risk of anarchy and bloody incidents grows. That is why we call on the Russian authorities to choose the path of de-escalation through the immediate demonstration of respect for the commitments made in the Geneva declaration. Yesterday, together with our European Union partners and the United States, we adopted new targeted sanctions. If the situation worsens, we will be forced to ratchet up the sanctions once again. That is not what we would prefer. Our goal is to ensure the holding on 25 May of free, inclusive and transparent presidential elections, whose good conduct will be guaranteed by the presence of international observers. The possibility that the actions of some violent groups could threaten the holding of this democratic exercise is unacceptable. We also support constitutional reform that would ensure respect for minorities and some decentralization. It is up to all Ukrainians to decide their future. Then history and geography can bring about an inevitable and desirable reconciliation between a democratic, peaceful and independent Ukraine and a Russian Federation that will renounce its dangerous nationalist illusions.","The recent events in south-eastern Ukraine and the country as a whole are of the most serious concern. The Kyiv regime, spurred on by Western well-wishers, are stubbornly pushing the country to disaster. Today, Western colleagues have spoken many critical words regarding the activities of protesters in south-eastern Ukraine. If our Western colleagues had actually demonstrated a tenth of that commitment to maintaining order during the events at the Maidan then perhaps the current crisis could have been prevented. On 17 April in Geneva, agreement was reached that all sides should refrain from any types of violence, intimidation or provocation. However, in just a matter of days, there was a resumption of the so-called counter-terrorist, but actually punitive, operations — out and out violations of that agreement. In the south-east, there was a deployment of roughly 15,000 military personnel, tanks, armed vehicles, artillery, aircraft and subdivisions of Right Sector Banderists. As the first attempts to bring military pressure to bear on the south-east led to the defection of some Ukrainian military to the side of the protesters, today the sub-units are staffed by those from the west of the country. One might wonder what political and psychological effect that has had on the south-east and how it ties in with the task of ensuring the territorial integrity of the country. In Geneva, it seemed that there was a window of opportunity for a significant de-escalation of the situation in Ukraine at the beginning of broad national dialogue. However, almost immediately following the declarations and actions of the Kyiv Government authorities, it became clear that they had no intention of implementing the agreement, just as they did not intend to implement the agreement of 21 February. In both cases, that treachery led to bloodshed. Unfortunately, it is difficulty to speak of confidence in the current coalition in Kyiv when the defence and law-enforcement agencies are essentially controlled by the Svoboda Party, whose political platform is based on declarations issued by Nazi collaborators in June 1941. Pursuant to those declarations, real Ukrainians should have collaborated with Hitler to establish a new order in Europe. I would recall that the collaborators and the followers of Bandera killed not only Jews, Poles and Soviet soldiers but also Ukrainians who refused to subscribe to their sloganeering. In Geneva, there was agreement on the need for a full rejection of extremism. However, the Right Sector Banderists, instead of laying down their weapons, headed to the east of Ukraine. As was declared, the Banderist army crossed the Dnepr. Neither the Right Sector with its Nazi slogans nor any other radical organizations have laid down their arms. On the contrary, those groups have become legal. They are forming military battalions with names like Dnepr and Donbass in their ranks. How could the militias in the east be convinced to disarm or vacate buildings if they have been surrounded, as has happened in Sloviansk, by subdivisions of the Ukrainian armed forces and the so-called National Guard, comprised of fighters from the Right Sector. In Geneva, there was agreement that there had to be a single approach to all illicit activities in Ukraine from whichever side they might emanate — that is, from Kyiv, the west, the east or the south. However, the Maidan remains occupied — cement blockades are still in place — as are several buildings in Kyiv. No one has liberated anything in Kyiv. In Washington, D.C., they are saying, uncritically, that the buildings have been legally rented. But by whom? They have been rented by armed fighters. In Geneva, there was agreement that there should be amnesty for protestors. However, instead of that, the People’s Governor of Donetsk, Pavel Gubarev, who never had weapons in his hand, remains in prison. He is a political prisoner, arrested just because he called for a referendum on the federalization of Ukraine. The monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) confirm that he was tortured and that he is now engaged in an indefinite hunger strike. Mr. Gubarev is far from being the only political prisoner of the Kyiv regime. One can speak of widespread witch hunts for those who have dared to express their disagreement with the Government in the Maidan. According to our sources, in the Donetsk region there are already about 10 cases of politically motivated kidnappings of people who were later transported to Kyiv by the special services. On 28 April, there was an attack on the life of the popular mayor of Kharkiv, Hennadiy Kernes. My colleague from the United Kingdom rushed to say that the protesters in the south-east participated in that crime. That demands a careful investigation of the case. Let us not try to prejudge the outcome. It is true that Mr. Kernes had indeed spoken out about the chaos in other regions of Ukraine, and there were serious political battles between him and one of the heads of the defence and law-enforcement agencies. On the same day — 28 April — at the Kherson airport, the presidential candidate’s plane was blocked. He had been travelling as part of the presidential campaign. He was attacked. In early April another candidate, Oleh Tsarev, was severely beaten. He was the only candidate for the presidential election without State protection. Mr. Tsarev was stripped of his right to participate in the televised debates. In that context, can we speak about the peaceful nature of the electoral campaign in Ukraine and of freedom of expression for its civilians? The key point of the Geneva agreement was broad national dialogue, which was to take into account the interests of all regions and political formations. The Kyiv Government made certain promises with regard to constitutional reforms and upholding the rights of minorities. But what about national dialogue and reform? According to meadia reports, today Mr. Yatsenyuk submitted to the Rada some sort of draft constitution. It is not really clear how it was prepared. What is certain is that it was not an open and inclusive process. In fact, the Party of Regions, which represents the rest of the east of the country, was excluded from the process. It is no surprise that the draft was immediately criticized in the Rada by all sides. We did not hear any reasonable answers to key questions, such as how the federalization or decentralization of the country would take place. It seems such things are to be substituted by some type of broadening of municipalities. How is the issue of the status of the Russian language to be resolved? Can anyone seriously assert that all those activities by Kyiv are a solution to the political crisis aimed at stabilizing Ukraine? Instead of genuine collective work to bring Ukraine out of the crisis, which was brought about by political misadventurism, our colleagues from the United States and the European Union have preferred to make strong insinuations against Russia and thinking up some sort of sanctions that are pointless and counterproductive. Perhaps they are satisfactory to someone, but the responsibility for the future of Ukraine, Europe and the world is not being considered — at least not by these people. The result is that the Government in Kyiv has done nothing to implement the Geneva document. Our Western colleagues, first and foremost our American colleagues, which have an unprecedented impact on the situation in Kyiv, do not want, or have not been able, to convince the Government to uphold its obligations under the document. They must clearly understand the scope of their responsibility if the situation in Ukraine continues to deteriorate. It is very difficult for us in Russia to see the chaos in such a close, fraternal country. But we understand the reason that brought about the protests in the east and south. People do not want a repeat of the Kyiv scenario. They do not recognize the legitimacy of the Kyiv Government, which is made up of oligarchs. They have decided to create their own governing bodies. In response, they have been accused of terrorism and punished by military operations. We call upon the Kyiv regime and its Western sponsors to think twice. There is a need to lift the order on using arms against civilians, as well as to free the political prisoners and disarm the Right Sector. A full constitutional process must take place, including representatives from all regions. We hope that the OSCE mission, headed by Mr. Apakan, which plays a particular role in the implementation of the Geneva agreement, will provide the Kyiv Government with assistance in establishing national dialogue and seeking understanding with the people in the south-east. However, the most important work to de-escalate should be done by the Kyiv Government — as they call themselves. I should now like to say a few words with regard to the issues touched on by colleagues. On the OSCE monitors in Sloviansk, they were requested by the Kyiv Government, and as such were responsible for their security. How can people be sent on a bus to an area controlled by self-defence forces, without even providing documents that would confirm their status? That was either a provocation by the Kyiv Government or just simple stupidity. We are doing everything we can for the freeing of those prisoners, and one has already been released due to health reasons. With regard to armed forces, our armed forces are on Russian territory. American forces are hardly at home. They are in Australia, Lithuania, Poland and on the Black Sea, where an American vessel has remained longer than it was invited to do. Yes, our troops do conduct training exercises. But they do so in a transparent manner and while upholding all existing international agreements. We do not have any aggressive intentions towards Ukraine. They Kyiv Government should keep a cool head and not engage in reckless activities with respect to the people in the south-east of the country, where there are many Russian citizens as well. I certainly do not want to prolong our meeting here this evening. The simplest of answers would be to again read the statement I made earlier, which reflects our vision and position. However, allow me a very brief comment. A great deal has been said here about some sort of wrong interpretation of our positions and statements in various forums and situations. Our Ukrainian colleague even began to depict some fantastic scenario of how he views the further developments unfolding in Ukraine. The only scenario that I would want to hear — but do not — is one that includes genuine efforts by the authorities in Kyiv to implement the Geneva document. Mr.Feltman began by saying that there were various interpretation of that document. The document is so simple, there is nothing to interpret. There is nothing to be done but to implement it. Let us do so. Russia helped to draw it up. But the actions backing it up need to be taken, first and foremost, by the authorities in Kyiv, if that is what they are. Unfortunately, their lack of action is reflected in the statement I made here earlier today.","I am grateful to Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing. The United Kingdom requested this meeting because we are deeply concerned by the deteriorating security situation in southern and eastern Ukraine and by the fact that the Geneva agreement of 17 April is not yet achieving its objective to restore stability in Ukraine. It is vitally important that the Security Council maintain its close scrutiny of events in Ukraine and the consequent threat to international peace and security. We will doubtless hear Russian claims that it is the actions of the Ukrainian Government that are destabilizing the south and east of the country. In fact, it is Russia that has taken further dangerous steps aimed at fomenting instability in Ukraine. It has directed paramilitary actions in Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Lugansk and other towns in eastern Ukraine. Russian military jets and helicopters have made incursions into Ukrainian airspace. Russian armed forces have held further military exercises on Ukraine’s border. These are all clear attempts to escalate tensions within Ukraine. These steps have been matched with intensified rhetoric. The Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation has asserted that Russia has a legal basis to intervene in Ukraine in accordance with the right of self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. This is a claim that takes Russia’s distortion of international law to a new level. There is no justification or legal basis whatsoever for invoking Article 51. Russian nationals are not under threat in Ukraine — a fact that has been reaffirmed on numerous occasions, including by the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission and by the Commissioner for National Minorities of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). This is deeply irresponsible rhetoric intended to threaten and intimidate the Ukrainian Government and provide a bogus pretext for further illegal breaches of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. As a result of Russia’s activities, there has been a further marked deterioration in the security situation in eastern and southern Ukraine, as Mr Feltman has just said. The United Kingdom condemns the abduction at gunpoint and public parading of an OSCE Vienna Document inspection team and its Ukrainian escorts. We call upon those responsible to ensure the safe treatment and immediate release of the team, and we urge Russia, itself an OSCE member, to use its influence to ensure that this happens without further delay. On 17 April, talks between Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union succeeded in agreeing steps to reduce tensions. The United Kingdom welcomed that agreement and the opportunity it offered for restoring stability in Ukraine. But this opportunity has been spurned. Since 17 April, the actions undertaken by Kyiv and Moscow stand in stark contrast. Let us consider the facts. First, the Geneva agreement called for all sides to refrain from violence, intimidation and provocative actions. For its part, the Ukrainian Government has acted with commendable restraint when undertaking measured and proportionate security operations to deal with armed groups illegally occupying Government buildings and forming checkpoints. The Ukrainian Government has the right and responsibility to uphold the rule of law and protect both its citizens and its officials on Ukrainian territory. Russia, on the other hand, continues its military manoeuvres and aggressive rhetoric. Secondly, the agreement called for all illegal armed groups to be disarmed. The Ukrainian Government started to collect illegal weapons almost as soon as it came to power. There are now no illegally armed protesters on Maidan Square and no armed self-defence groups patrolling the streets of Kyiv. But in Sloviansk and other eastern cities, we continue to see, encouraged by Russia, heavily armed paramilitary forces armed with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. Thirdly, the agreement called for all illegally seized buildings, occupied streets and public places to be vacated. The Ukrainian Government has been systematically and incrementally removing barricades around the Maidan and the protests there are gradually shrinking. By contrast, Russia has refused to use its influence to restrain armed groups in the east. In fact, Foreign Minister Lavrov stated on 23 April that Russia will not call for these illegal militias to put down their arms and vacate buildings. Instead, barricades and roadblocks in eastern and southern Ukraine have been steadily reinforced. Furthermore, while Ukraine has put a draft law to the Ukrainian Parliament that would provide amnesty for protestors who vacate Government buildings and lay down their weapons, Russia has not rescinded the order by the Russian Parliament to authorize the use of military force in Ukraine and will not condemn the widely reported abuses by pro-Russian armed groups in southern and eastern Ukraine. These abuses include at least 11 kidnappings, among them several Ukrainian and international journalists, and the torture and murder of a Ukrainian local official and two other local people. The deplorable shooting yesterday of the Mayor of Kharkiv was another sign of the violence being instigated against those who have opted to support a united Ukraine. Finally, Ukraine has begun an inclusive process of constitutional reform on the decentralization of power. It has announced measures to guarantee the protection of the Russian language, and it has condemned instances of anti-Semitism and xenophobia, whereas Russian rhetoric continues to whip up tensions with false claims that the Russian language is under threat in Ukraine and allegations that the Kyiv Government is anti-Semitic. When one lays out the facts, they cut through the fiction of Russian propaganda. Having illegally annexed Crimea, Russia is now destabilizing southern and eastern Ukraine as part of its plan to undermine the ability of the people of Ukraine to determine peacefully their own future. In doing so, it is threatening international peace and security. But the doors of diplomacy remain open. We urge Russia to abandon the dangerous course it is pursuing and to take urgent steps to implement the Geneva agreement. In the extremely difficult circumstances which now confront it, the Ukrainian Government is striving to take forward a programme of democratization and inclusive constitutional and economic reform that aims to correct the long period of misgovernment and corruption that preceded it. It is in all our interests to support this process. This is not about zero-sum game politics; it is about restoring stability to Ukraine and to the wider region and allowing all the people of Ukraine to determine their own future. We urge Russia to become part of this collective international effort.","I thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing. On 17 April, Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the European Union and the United States issued the Geneva joint statement to de-escalate the crisis that brings us together this evening. That statement outlined a series of concrete steps to end the violence, halt provocative actions and protect the rights and security of all Ukrainian citizens. As Secretary Kerry said on 17 April, “All of this, we are convinced, represents a good day’s work. The day’s work has produced principles and it has produced commitments and it has produced words on paper. And we are the first to understand and to agree that words on paper will only mean what the actions that are taken as a result of those words produce.” Secretary Kerry also commended Foreign Minister Lavrov and the Ukrainian Foreign Minister for their cooperation in achieving that hard-negotiated agreement. It was a moment of hope. Since then, the Government of Ukraine has been implementing its commitments in good faith. Regrettably, the same cannot be said of the Russian Federation. As we meet, observers from the special monitoring mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) are reporting that most of Ukraine, including eastern Ukraine, is peaceful. The exceptions are in such areas as Donetsk, Luhansk and Sloviansk, where pro-Russian separatists continue to occupy buildings and attack local officials. There we have seen a sharp deterioration in law and order. Just today, pro-Russian separatists armed with baseball bats, stormed the Government buildings in Luhansk, seizing control of the centre of municipal activity in one of the largest cities in eastern Ukraine. That kind of thuggery mimics the seizures of police stations, city halls and other Government buildings in cities and towns in Donetsk oblast and surrounding areas. In addition to occupying Government buildings, over the past two weeks, gunmen kidnapped a senior police officer in Luhansk. In Donetsk, pro-Russian thugs armed with baseball bats attacked peaceful participants at a pro-unity rally, seriously injuring at least 15. Also in Donetsk, pro-Russian groups continue to hold 17 buildings, including the regional television broadcasting centre. In the city of Sloviansk, the mayor was kidnapped, as were several journalists. The separatists in that area now hold an estimated 40 hostages. Nearby, three bodies were recently pulled from a river, each showing unmistakable signs of physical abuse; one has been identified as a local politician, another as a 19 year-old pro-unity student activist. Yesterday, gunmen reportedly chased members of the Sloviansk Roma community from their homes. Make no mistake: those are not peaceful protests. It is not an eastern Ukrainian spring. It is a well-orchestrated campaign, with external support, to destabilize the Ukrainian State. Finally, as all the world knows, pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk have kidnapped and continue to hold seven international inspectors, openly declared as members of a Vienna document mission, along with their Ukrainian escorts. My Government joins with responsible Governments everywhere in condemning that unlawful act and in being outraged by the shameful exhibition before the media of those international public servants. The Vienna document, agreed upon by all 57 participating States of the OSCE, has been a lasting source of cooperation and military transparency. We call, with others, for the immediate and unconditional release of the inspectors and their Ukrainian escorts and the immediate end to their mistreatment while in captivity. We also call upon Russia, as a signatory to the Vienna document, to help secure their release and to confirm publicly, even if belatedly, for the record that the abducted monitors were part of a legitimate mission on behalf of the international community. Since 17 April, the Government of Ukraine has acted in good faith and with admirable restraint to fulfil its commitments. The Kyiv city hall and its surrounding area are now clear of all Maidan barricades and protestors. Over the Easter holiday, Ukraine voluntarily suspended its counter-terrorism initiative, choosing to de-escalate despite its fundamental right to provide security on its own territory and for its own people. Unlike the separatists, Ukraine has cooperated fully with the OSCE special monitoring mission and allowed its observers to operate in regions about which Moscow had voiced concerns regarding the treatment of ethnic Russians. In addition, Prime Minister Yatsenyuk has publicly committed his Government to undertake far-reaching constitutional reforms that will strengthen the power of the regions. He has appealed personally to Russian-speaking Ukrainians, pledging to support special status for the Russian language and to protect those who use it. He announced legislation to grant amnesty to those who surrender arms. All of that should be cause for optimism and hope. Tragically, what we have seen from Russia since 17 April is exactly what we saw from Russia prior to 17 April: more attempts to stir up trouble, more efforts to undermine the Government of Ukraine and statement after statement at odds with the facts. What we have not seen is a single positive step by Russia to fulfil its Geneva commitments. Instead, Russian officials have refused to publicly call on the separatists to give up their weapons and relinquish their illegal control of Ukrainian Government buildings. In fact, Russia continues to fund, to coordinate and to fuel the heavily armed separatist movement. In addition, just outside of Ukraine’s border, Russia has continued to engage in threatening troop movements that are designed not to calm tensions, but to embolden the separatists and to intimidate the Government. In conclusion, I emphasize that the United States remains committed to supporting the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and will continue to uphold the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. We continue to seek stability within a peaceful, democratic, inclusive and united Ukraine, especially in advance of the upcoming important elections. We remain committed to a diplomatic process, but Russia seems committed to destabilization and fantastical justifications for its actions. The truth about what is happening in Ukraine should guide our discussion, because truth is the only foundation on which an equitable and lasting solution to this crisis can be based.",,,,,,,,,,,"I thank you for convening this meeting, Madam President, and for the opportunity to address the Security Council. I would also like to thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing, and all the members of the Council for their statement.
It has been a month since Russia illegally occupied and annexed Crimea, using its military forces and brutally violating international law. Unfortunately, Russia has not stopped there, and apparently its leaders are now targeting other parts of Ukraine and brazenly interfering in its internal affairs. The agreements reached at the Geneva meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the United States and the European Union on 17 April provided a faint beam of hope for a diplomatic solution.
In order to implement the Geneva statement for the de-escalation of the situation in the eastern regions of Ukraine, the Government of Ukraine immediately took the necessary practical steps. Within just one week, the Government suspended the active phase of its anti-terrorist operation, whose main objective was the restoration of law and order and the protection of civilians. It initiated constitutional reform. It approved the concept of local administrative reform, whose main principles are decentralizing power in the country, significantly empowering local communities and improving management at the regional and district levels. A draft law on amnesty for participants in the uprisings in the eastern regions has been prepared and would apply to those protesters who surrender their weapons and evacuate illegally seized administrative buildings, except for those suspected of committing serious crimes. The parliamentary coalition has invited all political parties represented in the Ukrainian Parliament to sign a memorandum of understanding on ways to resolve the situation in eastern Ukraine. The Minister of Internal Affairs and Security Services has continued implementing a nationwide campaign to seize illegal arms from the population, and more than 6,000 weapons have been handed over recently. Ukraine is demonstrating its commitment to constructive cooperation with human-rights institutions and international organizations.
What has Russia done for its part of the Geneva document? It has done nothing. Because of the lack of support for the separatists among the population of eastern Ukraine, Russia is seeking new ways to destabilize the situation in the region, preparing and carrying out numerous armed provocations through its agents. Russian-sponsored illegal paramilitary units have continued to destabilize the situation in eastern Ukraine, preparing the ground for a new stage of military aggression. The Russian leadership has done nothing to publicly dissociate itself from the armed separatists and provocateurs or to urge them to immediately lay down their arms and release captured administrative buildings. Russia has not even condemned the seizure of hostages, including journalists, or separatists’ open acts of xenophobia and anti-Semitism. Any attempts by Russia to show that the Ukrainian Government is trying to use force against the peaceful Ukrainian population are lies.
Our Government respects freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly, which are guaranteed by the Constitution of Ukraine. However, when heavily armed, professionally trained groups led by Russian military seize law-enforcement facilities and administrative offices, kill Ukrainian police officers and take hostages, they are operating like terrorists and must be treated accordingly. Ukrainian counter-terrorism operations are targeted exclusively at illegal armed groups threatening civilians. Meanwhile, the Russian-controlled army groups are in fact holding the entire civilian population of several towns in the eastern region hostage and have thus transgressed the bounds of humanity.
I will list some facts. Three Ukrainian law-enforcement officers were abducted, brutally beaten, tortured and later presented to the Russian media as Ukrainian spies, blindfolded and with their hands tied. Ukrainian and foreign journalists are being systematically kidnapped, while Russian journalists are allowed to operate in the areas controlled by the illegal armed groups. A military helicopter was destroyed with a man-portable air defence (MANPAD) guided missile. It should be understood that peaceful protesters cannot buy MANPADs in shops. Representatives of the military verification mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were taken hostage in Sloviansk. The detention by force of international observers is yet another testament to the criminal and terrorist nature of the separatist armed groups. In contrast to the demand voiced in many of the statements in the Council today that those hostages be released, the Russian Federation, as might be expected, made no such demand; nor have its leaders in Moscow.
What is important is that the leaders of the illegal armed groups have publicly admitted responsibility for all the aforementioned crimes — even on television. Many members of the illegal militant groups are citizens of the Russian Federation, and they are not even trying to hide it, publicly displaying their identification. We recently read an article in The New York Times in which the Kuban Cossack Mozhaev declared his presence and that of an armed group from his region, which we had noticed in Crimea as well.
Ukrainian law-enforcement agencies have credible evidence of these persons’ involvement in serious crimes. Today, some of those crimes have been described. Among them was the brutal story of Volodymyr Rybak, a member of Horlivka’s City Council, and Yuriy Popravko, a 19-year-old activist from Kyiv, who were martyred by members of terrorist groups. Their bodies, mutilated by torture, were found in the Torets River in the vicinity of Sloviansk. Volodymyr Rybak disappeared on 17 April in Horlivka after he tried to remove the separatists’ flag from the building of Horlivka City Council. A video of the kidnapping, as well as audio recordings of phone conversations intercepted by Ukraine’s Security Service, provided sufficient proof that terrorist leaders, notably the self-proclaimed mayor of Sloviansk, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, and the military commander of the terrorists, the Russian agent Igor Strelkov, were involved in the murder. The true identity of the Russian agent has been established as Colonel Igor Girkin of Russian military intelligence, who is registered as a permanent resident of Moscow.
The Government of Ukraine strongly condemns the aforementioned acts of terror and violence, including yesterday’s attempt to assassinate the Mayor of Kharkiv, Hennadiy Kernes, who publicly supported the unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Unfortunately, Russia has not even publicly condemned or dissociated itself from those acts of terror and violence perpetrated by illegal militants since the Geneva agreement. I would like to remind the Council that Russia used to deny that its armed forces participated in the occupation of Crimea. However, President Putin now openly admits the use of Russian military forces and praises them for their heroism and the successful completion of the operation aimed at the reunification of Crimea with Russia. They have even issued a special medal of honour. And now, in spite of numerous irrefutable facts concerning Russian military involvement in organizing and guiding illegal armed groups in eastern Ukraine, Moscow denies any Russian military participation just as hard.
Furthermore, Russia is now threatenting to use force, as demonstrated by its concentration of armed forces directly on the eastern border of our country. The number of units along Ukraine’s borders has increased. Last week, we all heard intensified militaristic rhetoric from senior Russian officials, including President Putin, Minister Lavrov and Minister Shoigu, threatening to send Russian troops into the territory of Ukrain under various pretexts. Defence Minister Shoigu reported the start of new military exercises by battalion tactical groups from the southern and western military districts of the Russian armed forces in connection with “the deteriorating situation in southeastern Ukraine”. With that the Russian side has in fact confirmed that its military activity near the Ukrainian border in the past month has not been routine in nature, but directly related to the developments in Ukraine. Unfortunately, the withdrawal of troops announced by Minister Shoigu yesterday has not come true. We still observe those troops near our borders.
My British colleague has given us information about the strange statement by our Russian partner here, who said that, in case of events taking a bad turn in Ukraine’s south-east, Russia would remember the provision to use armed forces in Ukraine given to President Vladimir Putin by the Federation Council. He also said that Russia had an international legal basis for sending its peacekeeping troops into Ukraine. And he referred to the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, which Russia used during the conflict in the Caucasus in 2008. The right to self-defence on the territory of another country? Let me remind him that Ukraine has never threatened Russia, and never will. Ukrainians want to live in peace and to be left alone. The highest level of cynicism is the Russian reference to the right of self-defence in a situation in which it is Russia that is acting as aggressor, having occupied Crimea, as is brutally interfering in the internal affairs of Ukraine, destabilizing it and trying to create an explosive situation in the eastern regions. Unfortunately, we are deeply concerned that the scenario that is prepared for eastern Ukraine might be similar to the one implemented by Russia in Abkhazia. That scenario might include several steps.
Step one: a small group of local separatists, supported by Russian-controlled armed groups, would seize control over regional councils and make them illegally proclaim the creation of a so-called independent Novorossiya within the boundaries described by President Putin at his recent press interview. We have already seen that step taken in Donetsk, Slovansk and Kharkiv, against the will of the vast majority of the local population and against the Ukrainian Constitution.
Step two: the Russian Federation would immediately recognize such a regional unit as an independent State.
Step three: upon a request from the newly self-proclaimed authorities, the Russian Federation would send its troops to Ukraine under the guise of peacekeepers or collective self-defence.
Unfortunately, I must say that such a scenario is realistic, as it has been reported that some Russian heavy military vehicles had been spotted near Ukraine’s borders bearing signs indicating “Peacekeeping Mission” in the Russian and Ukrainian languages, exactly as happened in Abkhazia. One of the main purposes of that scenario is to disrupt the presidential elections scheduled for 25 May, which are a top priority for the Government and for the people of Ukraine.
Let me sum up my statement by making some short conclusions. Twelve days have already passed since the Geneva meeting. Ukraine has done its utmost to de-escalate the situation. Our steps have been acknowledged and supported by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and other parties involved. Russia has done nothing.
How should the problem be solved? The answer is simple: Russia has to implement the Geneva agreements. First, Russia should withdraw its army from Ukraine’s borders. Secondly, it should make a high-level statement calling on its protégés to free all hostages, to disarm and to vacate all seized administrative premises. It also has to condemn all terror and violence committed by those groups and to disassociate itself from such activities. Thirdly, it should stop its war-like rhetoric and start to act in a constructive and civilized manner. Last, but not least, Russia must refrain from any actions aimed at undermining the 25 May presidential elections in Ukraine.
We call on the Security Council to give the most serious assessment of the actions and statements by Russia regarding Ukraine, and to take the most decisive steps to stop its aggressive appetite and to protect Ukrainian territorial integrity, which has been challenged once again. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Let me thank the Nigerian presidency for convening this open meeting, which does not cease to surprise us, judging by some of the statements we have heard. I might refer to some of the comments by our colleague from the Russian Federation. I would also like to thank Under Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing.
As so many of us have said here, the international community had placed high hopes on international mediation and monitoring efforts and on the 17 April Geneva statement on Ukraine. But, as we know today, the Geneva statement is just another document to be signed and discarded by Russia, adding to the growing list of breaches of Russia’s international commitments, such as the Helsinki Final Act, the 1991 Almaty Declaration, the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Russia and Ukraine of 1997 and the Charter of the United Nations itself.
Despite growing provocations, the Ukrainian authorities have taken a number of concrete steps to follow up on the Geneva statement. Barricades in Maidan Square are being dismantled. I recall my French colleague referring a number of times to the Internet and Google. Users of those will see that there is a significant difference in terms of what is happening on the streets of Kyiv. As I said, barricades are being dismantled. The Kiyv city administration building has re-opened, as has the main thoroughfare of the city, Khreschatik.
Important proposals regarding the status of the Russian language, amnesty, greater rights for the regions, as well as limitations on the President’s power, have been put forward by the transitional Governmet. Indeed, as Ambassador Churkin referred to earlier today, constitutional reform was being discussed by the Parliament in a public session accessible to all. There has been a major debate on what was being proposed. But, again, a major debate that includes criticism is a sign of democracy. Unanimous decisions and acceptance of whatever is put on the table is something that abelongs to regimes, not democratic Governments. We therefore welcome the discussion. It is necessary and it is something Kyiv has to do, and should be doing actively while involving all the regions and populations, because it affects the lives of the entire population of Ukraine.
Other issues discussed today include decentralization, constitutional reform, checks and balances, the powers of the President in the future, a stronger role for and the reinforcement of the independence of the judiciary, and so forth. Preparations are taking place for the national elections to be held on 25 May.
In a stark contrast to those efforts, armed separatists, aidead and abetted by Russia, are continuing their assault on Ukraine, adding violence to force and lawlessness to impunity. As many noted earlier, yesterday and today saw more violent attacks in the city of Luhansk and elsewhere — in Mykolaiv and in Konstiantynivka — where men armed with clubs and metal bars smashed windows and doors. A pro-unity rally was attacked by men in military fatigues, leading to over a dozen injuries among pro-Ukrainian protesters. A few days ago, a Ukrainian helicopter was downed by a rocket-propelled grenade, hardly a weapon so-called peaceful protesters — as labelled by the Russian side — can buy at the local corner market. That certainly does not sound like the implementation of Geneva agreement by the separatists and their state sponsors?
Displays of brutal force, beatings, disappearances, torture, killings and hostage-taking have become a daily reality in eastern Ukraine under militant separatist rule. While quick to condemn and brand Ukrainian authorities for alleged crimes, Russia has yet to issue a single condemnation of the violence carried out by armed separatists. The legitimate right of Ukraine, to which our Australian colleague has referred, to defend its territory and its State has been exercised with incredible restraint and caution, although portrayed by the Russian propaganda machinery as a bloodbath and a valid cause for intervention.
From the speaker before me, we heard references to military punitive operations and acts. If what Ukraine is carrying out in the eastern part of its country is a military punitive action, it is probably the most invisible, impossible military action on Earth. Nothing has happened in that sense. To exaggerate to such an extent is going a long way in terms of exaggeration. On the other hand, in a threatening tone, Russia recently ordered Ukraine to withdraw Ukrainian troops stationed on Ukraine’s own soil, or else — so much for respect for Ukraine’s international sovereignty.
We firmly reject all of Russia’s attempts to validate its intentions and threats to use armed forces or to send so-called Russian peacekeepers into Ukraine. As a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia should know better than to exploit the name of peacekeeping to cover up its aggressive expansionist aims.
Now I would like to turn to human rights and the media. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Representative on the Freedom of the Media, Mr. Dunja Mijatović, is sounding increasing alarm regarding the treatment of journalists and the deterioration of media freedom in eastern Ukraine. In areas under the control of pro-Russian militants, journalists are attacked, detained, harassed and their equipment taken or smashed. There is probably something to hide if there is such a distaste and dislike of free media in that part of Ukraine. We reiterate our call to end impunity for attacks against journalists. We also call for a thorough investigation of kidnappings, torture and killings, committed by whomever, and to insist that the perpetrators of all such acts be brought to justice.
We hope that the next report of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, to be issued in mid-May, will address the growing cases of human rights violations, violent deaths, causes for torture, abductions and activist disappearances in eastern Ukraine. We also hope the report will look into the human rights situation in occupied Crimea. As has been reported, the Crimean Tatar leader Mustafa Dzhemilev has been barred from returning home to Crimea. A group of camouflage-clad men stormed the Tatar Assembly offices and tore down the Ukrainian flag there. The director and editor of Crimean Tatar programmes on Crimean State television have been forced out by local authorities because they had spoken against increasing censorship.
A new level of banditry by the separatists in eastern Ukraine was reached on 25 April, when they kidnapped a group of OSCE representatives. Notably, when asked to release the hostages, the separatists were quoted as saying that they needed to speak to the competent authorities in the Russian Federation. My delegation strongly condemns the kidnapping of unarmed OSCE military verification mission observers and Ukrainian security personnel. Such acts, as well as the public parading of the hostages, speak loudly to the true character and intentions of the separatists, who seek to disrupt international observation so that they can continue attacking Ukraine out of sight of the international community.
The parties with influence on the militant separatists, first and foremost Russia, must take all necessary steps to bring about the immediate release of all hostages, without preconditions. The international monitoring and mediation efforts of the United Nations, OSCE and other regional bodies must be fully supported, guaranteed safety and security, and allowed full freedom of access on all of Ukraine’s territory.
As Ukraine prepares for the 25 May nation-wide elections, those opposed to Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity are at it again. To quote the self-proclaimed people’s mayor of Sloviansk, Vyacheslav Ponomarev, “We will take all necessary measures so that elections do not take place in the south-east”. When asked what they would be ready to do, he said: “We will take somebody hostage and hang them up by the balls. It is real, you understand?”
The intent here could not be more clear — it is to prevent Ukraine’s return to normality. We all understand that there are legitimate complaints in south-eastern Ukraine, borne out of decades of mismanagement and corruption and misrule, including the rule of the previous President, Yanukovych, who fled the country in disgrace. It is time for the current Government to start seriously addressing issues of socioeconomic development because a lot of that discontent is based on the socioeconomic concerns of the population. Once those issues are addressed, the level of so-called separatism, I am sure, will diminish. That should not happen, according to some, because it would go against the scenario.
My Government condemns the actions of armed separatists and their external sponsors, aimed at further undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. The onus is now on Russia to stop interfering in Ukraine’s internal affairs and fomenting unrest in Ukraine, and to abandon its threats of the use of force. Ukraine is doing its part to implement the Geneva agreement on Ukraine. It is time for Russia to live up to its own commitments and to reclaim respect for the Charter of the United Nations and international law. ","I shall now make a statement in my national capacity. I want to join other Council members in thanking Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Feltman, for his update on the situation in Ukraine.
The situation in Ukraine remains tense, and the risk of further escalation remains a matter of grave concern to the international community. Utmost care needs to be taken to ensure that the crisis does not degenerate into a civil war. If it does, it might become an internationalized conflict, with attendant reverberations everywhere. We followed with keen interest the talks held about two weeks ago in Geneva between Ukraine, the European Union, the United States and the Russian Federation.
At the meeting, they agreed on initial concrete steps to de-escalate tensions and restore security for all citizens. It was decided that all sides must refrain from violence, intimidation and provocative actions. The meeting specifically called for the disarmament of all illegal armed groups and the return of all illegally seized buildings to the legitimate owners. Significantly, it was agreed that protesters who laid down their arms and vacated the buildings they occupied would be granted amnesty.
We believe that the agreement reached in Geneva constitutes the basis for the peaceful resolution of the crisis in Ukraine. That scenario offered a glimmer of hope, as Under-Secretary-General Feltman has aptly characterized it. That glimmer of hope, I am afraid, is fast fading before our eyes. Armed men continue to occupy buildings in cities across eastern Ukraine, and the level of violence is escalating. The capture and detention of monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), who are designated and expected to play a leading role in implementing the de-escalation measures agreed on at the Geneva talks is, in our view, an affront to the international community. We support the position of the Secretary-General that international missions working in Ukraine must be allowed to perform their duties unimpeded. We call for the immediate release of the OSCE monitors and urge those with influence in the capitals to use it to that end.
As in every conflict, the way forward to lasting peace, security and stability in Ukraine lies in dialogue between all the parties concerned. The alternative of a military option would only bleed Ukraine’s already open veins. We believe that the Geneva agreement provides a strong surgical procedure that can mend those veins. The clock is ticking. Ukraine is the patient. The Security Council and the international community constitute the surgical team. Let us stabilize and restore the patient to health, or many more may bleed. That is our collective responsibility.
I now resume my functions as President of the Council.
I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine. ","I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman, for his briefing and to express our grave concern over the deterioration of the situation in eastern Ukraine.
Jordan would like to reaffirm Ukraine’s right to protect its territorial integrity and sovereignty and its citizens from threats by the rebels in eastern Ukraine. That is a right that is enshrined in international law. What is happening in eastern Ukraine at the hand of the rebels is a breach of law. The occupation of buildings and installations by means of armed force and the threat to the lives and security of people is not a peaceful expression of opinion. If those committing those acts believe that their claims are legitimate, their resort to force removes any legitimacy from their actions.
Jordan would like to call for the immediate release of the hostages detained by the rebels in Sloviansk, in eastern Ukraine, including the monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. We call on the parties concerned to implement the agreement concluded in Geneva on 17 April and to bring pressure to bear on the rebels to disarm, withdraw from the installations and buildings they occupy and immediately cease, together with all parties and actors in eastern Ukraine, from discriminatory and hate speech.
We call upon the Ukrainian authorities to work for a peaceful solution to the crisis, to abide by international norms in dealing with the mutiny and to respect the relevant human rights laws and principles.
We note the announcement by the Government of Ukraine accepting the competence of the International Criminal Court over the events that occurred from November 2013 to 22 February 2014. That indicates the readiness of the Ukrainian authorities to respect international sanctions criteria and the primacy of international law.
We call on all the parties concerned to push for the restoration of stability and security in eastern Ukraine and to assist the Ukrainian authorities in implementing a successful political transition process and beginning a comprehensive dialogue with all linguistic groups and communities. We stress the importance of the holding of the presidential elections as scheduled in May 2014. ","We welcome the briefing by Under-Secretary-General Feltman and the convening of this meeting at this delicate moment for Ukraine and the region.
Since the last time the Council met to discuss the situation in Ukraine (see S/PV.7157), the crisis has intensified in the eastern area of the country, in particular in Donetsk, Sloviansk, Kharkiv and Luhansk, owing to the acts of violence committed by separatist groups.
Chile would like to express its serious concern regarding the grave and even fatal consequences of the escalation of the crisis. In that respect, we condemn the kidnapping of the military monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Ukrainian security staff in Sloviansk. We call for their physical and psychological health to be preserved and for their immediate and unconditional release.
It is essential that the Council contribute to promoting maximum restraint and moderation by the parties, and we call upon all those with influence on the parties to take actions aimed at stopping the crisis. It is urgent that tensions be reduced and that we return to the spirit of compromise evidenced in the Geneva talks of 17 April, which led to the joint statement by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Russia and Ukraine, the Secretary of State of the United States and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy of the European Union. That statement listed concrete steps that Chile believes to be essential to reducing tensions and restoring security for all citizens, including abstaining from violence and intimidation, disarming the armed groups and vacating the illegally occupied buildings, among other things. We also believe that it is equally important that a broad and transparent constitutional process be launched, leading to the immediate establishment of an inclusive national dialogue.
We reiterate again the need to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Furthermore, we reiterate the obligation of Member States to abstain from resorting to the use or threat of use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of any State.
Once again, we call for the parties to find a peaceful solution to the crisis through direct political dialogue, abstain from taking unilateral measures and support the international mediation initiatives, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 68/262. That process should be inclusive and ensure respect for the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms and full respect for the rights of minorities.
I would like conclude by expressing my appreciation for the good offices of the Secretary-General and by underscoring the work of the United Nations human rights monitoring group for Ukraine and of the OSCE aimed at establishing the facts, reducing tensions and helping to create a climate conducive to the holding of presidential elections on 25 May. ","I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Feltman, for his briefing.
Chad, like other Member States, is extremely concerned by the deterioration of the situation in eastern Ukraine. Following a period of relative calm following the Geneva declaration, we are today faced with new circumstances, marked by the kidnapping of members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe mission, the attempted assassination of the mayor of Kharkiv, and the occupation of public buildings in Lugansk and elsewhere by pro-Russian elements. Chad condemns those violent acts, which undermine the negotiation and reconciliation efforts in Ukraine. Chad calls for the release of the hostages and for all parties to be calm and restrained.
Given the serious situation, Chad reiterates its appeal to those countries with influence over the parties to use every possible means at their disposal to give initiate dialogue between them. We are convinced that the solution to the problem in Ukraine can only be political. It should be sought with respect for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and unity of Ukraine, pursuant to the Charter of the United Nations. To that end, we urge the international community, and the Security Council in particular, to redouble their efforts to pursue mediation so as to bring the two sides closer together in seeking a peaceful solution in full respect for human rights and particularly for the rights minorities in Ukraine. ","I thank Under-Secretary-General Feltman for his briefing and his warning to the Council. Australia strongly supported calls for the holding of tonight’s briefing to give the Council an up-to-date sense of the continuing destabilization and increased tensions in eastern Ukraine, much of which has evidently been sponsored and condoned by the Russian Federation.
We, with the rest of the Council, welcomed the 17 April agreement reached in Geneva on steps to de-escalate the crisis, including commitments to refrain from further acts of violence and provocation. That was a positive development and, we hoped, a demonstration of serious commitment to reduce tensions and work cooperatively towards a diplomatic and political solution to the crisis.
Ukraine is living up to its Geneva commitments. It has submitted to Parliament a draft law on amnesty for protesters who surrender their weapons. It has initiated a process of constitutional reform aimed at decentralizing power. It has committed to holding a broad public debate on possible constitutional changes and sought proposals for constitutional reform. It is working to disarm radical movements. The Ukrainian Government has also said that it will guarantee the rights of Russian speakers to use their own language. It has strongly condemned xenophobia, intolerance and anti-Semitism and begun an investigation into the distribution of anti-Semitic leaflets in Donetsk. It has invited all political groups to discuss ways to resolve the crisis in eastern Ukraine and it has supported the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in its work to de-escalate tensions.
But what has Russian done since 17 April to honour its Geneva commitments? Disappointingly, all evidence at hand points to Russia’s continued determination to promote instability and challenge Ukraine’s authority over its sovereign territory. Russia’s claims that it has no agency in or influence over the actions of armed militia groups operating in eastern Ukraine are not credible. The seizure of OSCE observers on 25 April in Sloviansk and their mistreatment and their continued detention is a deplorable and cynical act against impartial international personnel working to bring peace and stability to the region, an act clearly intended to impede the ability of all OSCE monitors to work in eastern Ukraine. We call for their immediate release.
We have also witnessed continued and extreme provocations, including military manoeuvres on the Russian side of the Ukrainian border and reported multiple violations of Ukrainian air space by Russian military aircraft. We have witnessed the deplorable shooting on 28 April of the Mayor of Kharkiv and the abduction and killing of a Horlivka City Council representative. We are seeing continued occupation of Government buildings by well-armed and coordinated paramilitary groups, including, today, the occupation of Government buildings in Lugansk. We are seeing the increasing intimidation of local populations and illegal detentions. Under-Secretary-General Feltman has just reported to us increasing reports of violence, with people killed, wounded, beaten and tortured.
In those circumstances, it is appropriate and necessary for the Ukrainian Government itself to take measures to try to ensure security and protect its citizens in its own territory. It has shown considerable restraint in the face of extreme provocation, but it has a right to enforce the rule of law and respond in a manner proportionate to the circumstances.
We welcome Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Lubkivsky’s statement during his 25 April press conference at the United Nations that Ukraine would protect its people from provocation in a civilized manner so as to avoid bloodshed. We welcome Ukraine’s recent acceptance of jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC) with respect to crimes committed in its territory from November last year to February 2014. We urge Ukraine to extend the ICC’s jurisdiction to crimes committed beyond that date and to accede to the ICC Statute.
For its part, overwhelmingly, the international community remains united in its support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territory integrity and in its position that Russia cease its illegal intervention, interference and provocative actions in Ukraine. Statements by other Security Council members tonight are further confirmation of that.
To conclude, Australia continues to call on Russia to meet its Geneva commitments, to allow Ukraine’s elections on 25 May to proceed without interference or obstruction, which is the right of every sovereign nation, and to exercise its influence over separatist activists in Ukraine towards those ends. The crisis remains very dangerously poised. Active, genuine and immediate efforts by Russia to defuse it are imperative.",,,,"I would like to thank you, Madam President, for convening this emergency meeting on Ukraine, and Mr. Jeffrey Feltman, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, for his briefing on the developments in the situation in eastern Ukraine. We believe, however, that the Ukrainian people and the international community will not judge us on the number of public briefings we organize in the Council or the toughness of our statements, but on our political will and how we use our influence to effectively help Ukrainians resolve the crisis in their country.
We are witnessing a situation that is deteriorating every day and leading slowly to an open war that might involve countries of the region and beyond. Indeed, the developments of the last few weeks are alarming and have immensely undermined the diplomatic efforts to defuse the situation. We condemn in the strongest terms the attempt made to assassinate Hennadiy Kernes, the Mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, as well as the illegal detention of the military monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and their Ukrainian staff, which is a serious violation of the current agreement, and we demand their immediate release.
While we welcome the joint de-escalation measures agreed on in Geneva on 17 April and involving the main stakeholders as a step towards a tangible solution to the crisis, we are concerned about the fact that many of those measures have not been implemented. We urge all parties to implement their parts of the agreement, and especially to disarm all military groups and restore all seized buildings. The OSCE monitors must be allowed to play a role and to fulfil their mandate, as stipulated in the joint declaration.
In the meantime, Rwanda reiterates its call for respect for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. We believe in the right to peaceful demonstration, but we firmly condemn the use of violence, the seizure of public buildings and the installation of illegal checkpoints by armed protesters. We therefore believe that Ukraine, like any other country, has a right to restore public order, provided that right is exercised in a proportionate manner. Nonetheless, the crisis in eastern Ukraine is not merely a matter of public order but a political issue that must be resolved through genuine dialogue with all Ukrainian parties, with a view to ensuring sustainable peace and equal rights for all, including the Russian-speaking minority.
To conclude, we reiterate our strong belief that while public meetings of the Council are important for its members to continue monitoring this crisis, the only way to solve the crisis in Ukraine is through the exercise of political will and the influence of all the countries and regional organizations involved, in order to ensure a political and diplomatic solution to the conflict. ","I would like to thank Mr. Feltman for his update on the difficult situation in Ukraine.
I am wondering, and I would also like to ask the Council, why we are having this meeting. Going over the difficult situation and the worsening of the crisis once again is undoubtedly one reason, although I know there are clear, decisive reasons behind the initiative of the United Kingdom to convene this meeting that brings us all together. I also ask myself another question, not out of false piety but out of sincerity. It is the question Pope Francis asked a few days ago when he received Mr. Yatsenyuk — who has not sped up hatred and violence — and gave him a pen with which he might sign a peace.
Are we acting in the Council to help overcome misunderstandings? I am certain that we are. It is for that reason that today my country will merely reaffirm two convictions. That is, that in the dialogue of constructive diplomacy that was initiated on 17 April with a view to finding a peaceful and political solution to this critical situation, Russia, the United States, the European Union and Ukraine all expressed at Geneva a willingness to reach an agreement. What we saw as willingness to agree, the whole world saw as a source of hope.
Today, however, we must urge the parties to return to a constructive dialogue. The difficult situation facing Ukraine cannot be resolved through unilateral actions of any sort. It is essential that we strictly abide by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and not intervene in matters under the domestic jurisdiction of States in any way, including military, political and economic. We have already said that, and we have not come here to repeat things. We have come to say that it is understandable that the Council is meeting today.
The other reason we are here is to reject violence involving two concrete events, namely, the attack against the Mayor of Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine, and, as requested by the Secretary-General, Argentina calls for the immediate and unconditional release of the military observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe who are being held hostage.
Again we reiterate that the Council meets in order to promote peace. With a pen in hand and with our good faith, we stand ready to help Ukraine emerge from this difficult situation so that it can achieve the peace that its people deserve. ","I join others in thanking Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman for his briefing on the developments concerning Ukraine. We share his assessment that the situation in eastern Ukraine is deteriorating alarmingly, especially in Kharkiv, Luhansk and in the Donetsk area. We are deeply concerned by the actions of the pro-Russian separatist militias backed by Russia, aimed at destabilizing eastern Ukraine and, it seems, preventing the holding of the presidential elections on 25 May.
These destabilizing actions have intensified again in recent days, with the proliferation of the illegal occupation of public buildings, an increasing number of attacks against the Ukrainian security forces and an increase in violence against the local population. As others have already mentioned, just yesterday peaceful demonstrators in favour of the unity of the Ukraine were violently attacked by armed pro-Russian gangs armed with clubs and baseball bats in the city of Donetsk. Today hundreds of pro-Russian demonstrators seized the building of the regional administration and the prosecutor’s office in the city of Luhansk, and stormed the police station.
We condemn those actions and the attacks targeting political figures in the strongest terms. The torture and murder of the Horlivka city councillor, Volodymyr Rybak, whose remains were found last week near Sloviansk together with those of a young student from Kyiv, Yuriy Popravko, attest to the high level of violence. Yesterday, the mayor of Kharkiv, Henadiy Kernes, was the target of an assassination attempt — there are differing interpretations with regard to the party responsible. These crimes must be investigated and everything possible must be done to prevent similar cases in the future.
The violence of recent days shows once again the need to urgently de-escalate the situation. We welcome the positive steps taken by Ukraine to fulfil the commitments set out in the Geneva statement adopted on 17 April by Ukraine, Russia, the European Union and the United States. The Ukrainian Government has proposed an amnesty for those who leave the buildings they occupy in eastern Ukraine, as long as they have not committed crimes. It is ready to launch an inclusive national dialogue on constitutional reform and decentralization, and has acted with restraint in response to the actions of armed militias in the east.
The international community expects Russia, for its part, to take concrete steps to bring the separatists in eastern Ukraine to de-escalate in accordance with the commitments undertaken in the Geneva statement. We expect Russia to use its influence over the separatist movements to convince them to seek dialogue with the Ukrainian Government instead of fighting. Russia should publicly condemn the actions of the separatists aimed at destabilizing Ukraine and call on armed militants to leave the illegally occupied buildings. Finally, the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Ukrainian border is an essential step for de-escalating tensions, especially in eastern Ukraine.
We strongly condemn the kidnapping near the town of Sloviansk on 25 April of a team of military inspectors deployed under the 2011 Vienna document of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). We also condemn the temporary detention, on 27 April, of two members of the OSCE special monitoring mission in Yenakiyeve. The safety of international observers deployed anywhere in Ukraine must be ensured by all parties. The OSCE monitoring mission must be able to fulfil its role in the implementation of the Geneva statement.
We call on Russia to continue to use all of its influence on the pro-Russian separatists to encourage them to release unconditionally and promptly the seven inspectors from OSCE participating States that they have been holding hostage in Sloviansk for the past four days, as well as the Ukrainian personnel accompanying them.
We also condemn the restrictions on media freedom and on the freedom of expression. The detention and intimidation of journalists have increased over the past two weeks in the east of the country. The day before yesterday, pro-Russian separatists took control of the regional public television station in Donetsk. The OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, Ms. Dunja Mijatović, has repeatedly warned against misinformation and propaganda. I would like to join her appeal and highlight that any limitations on the freedom of the press is unacceptable.
Nothing can take the place of direct, substantive dialogue between Kyiv and Moscow to find a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis. The crisis continues to worsen. It will have harmful consequences for the entire region, Europe and beyond. The Geneva declaration of 17 April cannot remain a dead letter. The alternative to dialogue and to de-escalation would have incalculable consequences for international peace and security.","The Republic of Korea is deeply concerned over the continuing tensions in eastern Ukraine. Despite the agreement reached in Geneva on 17 April, the situation in Ukraine is showing no signs of abating. We are troubled in particular by the continuing violence and aggressive provocations by illegal armed groups, including the seizure of key public buildings and the recent assassination attempt against the Mayor of the eastern city of Kharkiv.
All provocative actions and hostile rhetoric aimed at destabilizing Ukraine must cease immediately. As agreed in the Geneva statement, all illegal armed groups must be disarmed and all illegally seized key public buildings vacated.
We strongly condemn the detention of military monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as well as of Ukrainian staff by illegal armed groups. It should be noted that the OSCE monitoring mechanism is an indispensable tool for implementing the Geneva statement. It is unacceptable to target international observers who are working to de-escalate the volatile situation. They must be released immediately and unconditionally. The safety and security of all international personnel must be fully guaranteed by all actors on the ground. In the light of the ongoing situation in Ukraine, we reiterate that constructive dialogue among all concerned parties will be the only way to achieve a peaceful solution. In that regard, we call for all parties to the Geneva statement to implement their commitments. As Ukraine moves towards critical elections in May, it is all the more important to ensure the holding of fair and free elections in the country, without any intervention or influence by outside forces. We hope that the Ukrainian Government will lead an inclusive and transparent constitutional process.
We once again reaffirm our full support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity."
S/PV.7157,16/04/2014,Situation in Crimea and deterioration of political situation in South-Eastern Ukraine,"I thank Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for his briefing. China is deeply concerned about the recent escalation of the situation in Ukraine. We hope that all parties can remain calm, exercise restraint and prevent a further deterioration of the situation. The priority now is to work within the framework of law to resolve differences through dialogue and negotiation, with full consideration of the legitimate rights, interests and aspirations of all regions and ethnic communities. That is the only approach that can bring lasting peace and stability to Ukraine, in keeping with the long-term fundamental interests of the nation as a whole and all of its communities. China views the issue of Ukraine as highly complex and believes that the only solution is to remain on the path to a political settlement, which requires a favourable external environment. China has been calling on the international community to work constructively through its good offices to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine. China has put forward a three-point proposal on seeking a political solution to the Ukrainian issue. We have taken note of the ongoing discussion on establishing a multilateral mechanism for dialogue. China welcomes those efforts, which are largely in line with the Chinese proposal. China supports the early launch of dialogue and consultations among the relevant parties, based on full consideration and accommodation of all legitimate interests and concerns in order to find a definitive solution that is acceptable to all.","The report before the Council is damning for two reasons. First, it describes in the harshest terms the sorry tale of years of corruption and abuse on the part of former President Yanukovych and his predatory and criminal team. Is it any wonder that the Ukrainian population, exasperated by years of incompetence and corruption, rose up in protest? There was no foreign involvement there. The report also describes how the regime responded to legitimate, peaceful demonstrations with the use of force. The titanic task of restoring trust of all Ukrainians in their institutions lies with the new Ukrainian Adminstration. The report underscores that since the very first measures were undertaken by the new Administration, calm has returned to Kyiv. On the issue of languages and regional status, we encourage the Kyiv authorities to pursue their efforts to promote a return to reason, launch constructive and inclusive dialogue, and reassure the people regarding their place in Ukraine. The acting President has refused to repeal the law on official languages. This symbolic decision demonstrates the will of the Ukrainian authorities to strive for the country’s reconciliation. Ukraine can preserve the diversity that constitutes its richness and uniqueness. To that end, Ukraine needs our support. The first stage — the holding of the presidential election on 25 May — is key. We must support the Ukrainian authorities in order for the election to be held in the best possible conditions and ensure the representation of all. We must move towards a free and transparent election, guaranteed by the presence of international observers. It would be unacceptable for the activities of violent groups to threaten the holding of that democratic step, which is essential to the country’s future. We will not accept the result of that vote, the harbinger of great hope for the entire country, being disputed as result of any event devised from outside. I now come to my second point. The report draws a bleak picture of the impact of Russia’s actions on the situation inside Ukraine. It describes the chain of events that led to the annexation of Crimea. It once again underscores that there was no threat to the Russian-speaking population of Crimea, a defence that is nevertheless upheld by Russia to justify its intervention. Quite the opposite, the report underscores that the risk of human rights violations now threatens the Ukrainian and Tartar populations. The United Nations must continue to take note of the human rights situation in Crimea, which is an integral part of Ukraine, as the General Assembly recalled by an overwhelming majority. The report also underscores that the deteriorating conditions and human rights violations that preceded the holding of the referendum in Crimea on 16 March were the result of deliberate acts. The presence of soldiers in uniform without insignia, the seizure of public buildings, intimidation of the civilian population, journalists and human rights activists, the presence of foreign voters and the violent propaganda against Kyiv broadcast on Russian television channels were all coordinated and orchestrated acts. They served as a prelude to an annexation unprecedented in the twenty-first century. Today, we are seeing a similar scenario in eastern Ukraine. In that regard, I believe that all Council members and all my colleagues here in the Chamber read the excellent article in this morning’s New York Times, which describes how Russia has established its own virtual reality, which bears no relation to the real situation. My Russian friend’s statement today shows, I believe, just how accurate and how true to the reality that article is. Let us recall the past. Participants will perhaps recall being told of 600,000 refugees fleeing the Ukrainian terror, who seem to have disappeared from one day to the next. We were told that there were no Russian soldiers in Crimea, while on YouTube we could see lorries with Russian army number plates. Today, the same disinformation continues. We are told of peaceful protesters, while again on the Internet one can see that they are heavily armed militia. We are told that there is no Russian intervention, while again on the Internet one can see soldiers without insignia, flaunting weapons with which only the Russian army is equipped. We are told that a fascist terror prevails in Kyiv, while we know very well that if we were to go to Kyiv we would see that calm prevails. We are told that Jews in Ukraine are threatened, while the two Ukrainian Jewish organizations themselves say that they are not threatened. I could mention many more examples, but never was a statement clearly so far from the reality that, thanks to the Internet, we all can see on the computer. Ukraine is cornered and under attack. On Sunday, right here, it was ordered not to react. One cannot imagine that it would suffer without reacting to the aggression to which it was first subjected a month ago, condemned by the General Assembly in resolution 68/262, and which it is again experiencing in the east of the country. We welcome the restraint of the Ukrainian security forces, who seek to respond in a proportional way to the unprecedented destabilizing actions against them, organized from abroad. We call on Russia to commit to de-escalation and to condemning, together with the rest of the Council, the attempts at destabilization in eastern Ukraine. Furthermore, we call on Russia to stop trapping itself in a spiral to extremes that can lead only to tragedy. It must withdraw its troops from the border. It must cease its destabilizing activities. It must stop shouting about an imminent civil war. No one is deceived by the scenario of the arsonist firefighter — an unsubtle picture and not even a real semblance of credibility. The situation is now extremely serious. A meeting that will bring together Russia, the United States, the European Union and Ukraine will be held in Geneva tomorrow. That event is crucial, and we call on parties to remain calm and to exercise restraint. In the case of failure or if Russia were to seek to avoid that meeting, new sanctions would be inevitable. That is not our preferred path. We will be firm. Fully legitimate authorities must be established in Kyiv. Elections must be held on 25 May, and we will not allow Russia either to prevent them from taking place or to discredit them.","The recent events in south-east Ukraine are of great concern. On 13 April, having convened an emergency meeting of the Security Council (see S/PV.7154), the Russian delegation has insistently called upon a number of members of the Council to use all tools available to them to prevent the use of force in the crisis in the eastern regions of Ukraine. In response, we have heard a number of ambiguous statements, with some delegations expressing their understanding for the plans of the Ukrainian authorities to use force against their fellow countrymen. The result is obvious. Those who usurped power in Kyiv through a violent Government coup have now taken the route of ignoring the legitimate demands of the inhabitants of south-eastern Ukraine and exercising the unconstitutional use of military force in order to pacify their own people, whom they blasphemously call bandits and terrorists. Such reckless steps are fraught with the potential to unleash a real civil war in Ukraine. The first blood has already been shed. The citizens of the south-east have repeatedly warned the authorities that they are ready to act as human shields. In a number of areas regular units of the Ukrainian army and internal forces have openly refused to shoot at their fellow countrymen. There have been cases where soldiers have gone over to the side of the people. Is that not why the self-proclaimed leaders of Kyiv are deploying the right-wing militants and other illegal militias behind whose bayonets they actually came to power? For example, people in black uniforms — not belonging to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence or internal troops — were sent into Kramatorsk. Who do those elements answer to? Of course, it is hardly likely that anyone can have any illusions about the independence of Kyiv’s actions. And that raises the question that perhaps the coup scenario for Kyiv was suggested by the countries whose senior emissaries are constantly whispering things in the ears of the Ukrainian leaders they sponsor. The recipe for a way out of the massive internal political crisis afflicting Ukraine is both simple and complicated. The Ukrainians must launch a dialogue, provided that it is inclusive and comprehensive. Every region and political force in the country, without exception, should participate in it on equal terms and with the same right to decisions on the pressing issues. All of that should be reflected in a thoroughly reformed Constitution that Ukraine’s multiethnic society would perceive as trustworthy, based on a foundation of a legitimate Government with a long-term perspective. Without that, it will be difficult for Ukraine to remain unified or resolve its current tangle of urgent problems. The plan is to make this subject the main topic at the Geneva meeting, which for now is still on the agenda, and it should be the basic task of the international community when it expresses its concern about what is happening in Ukraine. It must be made to begin genuine constitutional reform, not a cosmetic version. Right now it is vital that we receive accurate information about what is happening in Ukraine. If the internationalists want to justify their presence in the country, they should assess the evolving situation objectively and impartially. Unfortunately, the report published yesterday by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights suggests the opposite. The document is one-sided and biased. Its drafters preferred not to notice that the current authorities in Ukraine acquired that status through an armed coup, not civilized democratic elections. Attacks by illegal armed security groups and the pillaging of administrative buildings by radicals miraculously qualify in the report as peaceful protests, while demonstrations by Ukrainian citizens in the country’s eastern regions are declared to be illegal acts. The report states credulously that the Ukrainian Government is apparently firmly committed to breaking with past injustices and elaborating a new vision for Ukraine’s future. It omits inconvenient facts that testify to the fact that from day one this Government’s activities have been carried out in an atmosphere of violence and lawlessness that it has itself created. The report gives no attention whatever to the highly dangerous trend towards the uncontrolled growth of aggressive nationalism and neo-Nazism. In fact, the term “neo-Nazism” is delicately not used at all. The raging chauvinism in western and central Ukraine whipped up by right-wing and other far-right groups is presented only in the characterization the right of minorities to participate in political life is not fully taken into account. Nothing is said of the public calls to incite national hatred and even destroy the Russian population. The pronouncements of the leader of the parliamentary Freedom party refer to liberating Ukraine from the so-called Moskal’sko-Zhidovskaia mafia — for those who have not heard this gangster slang before, it means Russians and Jews. I would like to recall that this individual, according to the Simon Wiesenthal Center, appears in fifth place on the list of the most rabid anti-Semites in Europe. For all practical purposes, this party is now in charge of the military and other forces in Kyiv. Those who foment incitement to murder and violence based on ethnicity are criminals. They should be promptly arrested and brought to justice in compliance with Ukraine’s international obligations, including in the area of human rights, not acting as the backbone of the National Guard and the current ruling elite. Despite the fact that the report rightly calls Ukrainian society bilingual, the true position of the Russian-speaking population is not reflected in it at all. We should remember that at different times they are referred to as non-natives, a minority, aliens, invaders. The Russian language is gradually being pushed out of circulation. There have been numerous cases of harassment and of Ukrainian nationalists and radicals’ use of physical violence against representatives of the former authorities as well as those who simply disagree with the current regime. In recent examples, on 7 April participants in a congress of justices were mocked and insulted. On the night of 15 April the headquarters of the Communist Party of Ukraine in Sumy was destroyed. Unfortunately, the authors of the report preferred to ignore this scandalous evidence of the lawless acts of supporters of the current regime in Kyiv. Instead, it is packed with references to the testimony of various anonymous witnesses who saw or heard something, somewhere. The report’s assessment of the situation as it relates to freedom of speech and the press does not stand up to scrutiny. As if the Ukrainian authorities’ continued attempts to hinder objective coverage of the situation, their threats against and intimidation of journalists, their refusal to allow representatives of foreign media into the country did not exist. Concern about this situation has been expressed not only by credible non-governmental organizations such as Reporters without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists, but also by the European Commission. How can we possibly talk about respect for human rights and the rule of law if even presidential candidates in Ukraine — Oleg Tsarev and Mikhail Dobkin — are being attacked, and Ukraine’s Parliament has finally been turned into a type of might-makes-right democracy? With regard to the OHCHR report and today’s baseless fabrications by Mr. Šimonović about the situation in Crimea, that region has declared itself a subject of the Russian Federation and therefore cannot in principle be an object of the discussion in today’s meeting on the situation in Ukraine, and would not serve the purposes of that discussion. We get the impression that the report was fabricated based on conclusions formulated in advance whose political orientation Mr. Šimonović expressed in a statement about the results of his first visit to Ukraine in March. In general, we are obliged to conclude that the report undermines the credibility of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights as an impartial defender of human rights. We will continue to closely monitor the work of the mission. Let us see how its future reports reflect the violence being unleashed on the south-east of the country thanks to the Kyiv authorities. We advise all who champion human rights in this country through deeds rather than words to pay special attention to the actions of Kyiv’s self-proclaimed authorities, who threaten the east and south-east with enforced pacification, inflicting brutal, massive violations of human rights, especially on the Russian and Russian-speaking populations of those regions. First of all, I feel compelled to pause on various assertions that my Ukrainian colleague just made in his statement. I cannot analyse his entire statement, particularly since it is impossible to figure out which parts of his speech are his own and which parts are borrowed from some mystery source, the when and where of whose proclamations are unknown. In any case, of course, he is responsible for everything that was said. We will not discuss the situation in Crimea in the Security Council, or at least not under the rubric of the situation in Ukraine. But he made one assertion that is simply crude provocation that I cannot ignore, which is that the Tatar population of Crimea believes there will be a third act in the history of genocide against them, and so forth. That is simply nonsense, and a crude provocation. The new Constitution that has already been adopted in Crimea, for instance, actually strengthens Tatar as a third official language in Crimea, which it never was before, alongside Russian and Ukrainian. High-level positions in Crimea’s ministerial departments have been reserved for representatives of the Tatars, which was also not the case previously. Moreover, the Crimean Tatars will be able to take advantage of the fact that not only will their social, economic and other issues be dealt with by the Russian authorities, who are giving them the attention they need, but that this will be done with the help of Tatarstan, one of the strongest, most powerful and successful subjects of the Russian Federation. An agreement between the Russian and Tatarstan authorities to work together on this issue is already in place. The Council therefore has no need to worry about the fate of the Crimean Tatars. Over the past two and a half decades since Ukraine became independent, the Crimean Tatars have struggled with what we in Russian call a wretched existence. That condition will now come to an end, although it will probably take some time. Turning now to another topic that is not appropriate for the Security Council, but my Ukrainian colleague wrongly characterized what I said about the Russian language in Ukraine. What I said was that the Russian language is gradually being pushed out of circulation. And that is exactly the case. The first step that Mr. Sergeyev’s new leadership took was to shut down the Russian-language versions of all its ministerial department websites. He cited a great many figures; I have one. According to my information, of the 195 Russian schools that existed in Kyiv in the 1990s, five remain. In order to enter any Ukrainian university, a candidate has to do an interview in Ukrainian. While Ukrainian is close to Russian, it is still a language that has to be studied separately, so Russians have to struggle with Ukrainian in order to get through the university entrance interview. However, this is a major subject that deserves separate discussion and consideration, which would include the rights of Ukrainians in Russia. Of course, Ukrainians in Russia do not all live in a compact area, unlike the Russians living in Ukraine. I would now like to say a few words about the statements made by some of my other colleagues in the Security Council. Needless to say, many aspects of our discussion are reminiscent of a broken record, and indeed we have already gone over this subject a dozen times, but some things said by my colleagues today were genuinely startling. For example, our British colleague said that Russia should explain its concerns. We have made numerous statements at the highest levels. We have explained our concerns at the level of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Our United Nations delegation has repeatedly gone into great detail in spelling out our vision of how we — together with the Ukrainians and those members of the international community who are ready to do so — propose to work to help Ukraine extricate itself from this crisis. But some people are still sitting there, waiting for us to explain our concerns. Maybe they are simply not listening; or perhaps they do not want to listen. That is quite another issue. Turning to the second aspect of this issue, it is of course good that our concerns are listened to and understood, but the important thing is to understand the concerns of the people of Ukraine, and in this case to understand the concerns of the people of south-eastern and southern Ukraine. What has the Kyiv leadership of Ukraine done to listen to their concerns? Mr. Yatsenyuk visited the Donbas region. He did not even meet with any of the protesters. He met with his friends, with oligarchs — people whom the Kyiv leadership has appointed to various positions. It is true that he did say some of the right things, which later were essentially contradicted by his colleague Mr. Turchynov, who on the following day said that military force should be used against the south-eastern region. I now turn to the statement made by my respected colleague from the United States. She said something quite true, which is that it is not good when an opposition takes up arms and seizes administrative buildings. It is annoying, however, that this understanding on the part of the United States representative has come too late. For instance, why was it not expressed in January, when Kyiv was in turmoil that was several degrees more intense than what we are seeing in the cities of eastern Ukraine. Why did the representative of the United States not say the same things here in the United Nations, in Washington, D.C., or in its numerous talks with the Kyiv authorities? Perhaps then this crisis would not have occurred. Of course it is not good when citizens take up arms, but in Kyiv, when the issue of illegal units came up, one statistic emerged to the effect that there were 3 million illegal firearms in Ukraine. But when people are worried about their well-being and are trying to defend themselves somehow, how can they not arm themselves? That is undoubtedly understandable, although from the point of view of lawfulness, in the normal sense of the word, it naturally raises questions. My French colleague brought up an excellent phrase, “virtual reality”. Indeed, I found myself thinking about just that phrase when I was listening to the statements of some of our colleagues. People have come to power in Kyiv by military means. Many of them have the sort of reputation that would make you think twice about shaking their hands. In 2012, the European Parliament resolved that there was no way any coalition could be struck with them. They seem to make promises of some sort, but they do not keep any of them. For instance, they undertook to disarm people in Kyiv. They did not do so. Were any objective investigations conducted into the violence that took place in Kyiv in February, and perhaps in the crisis that was ongoing before that? A Prosecutor General appeared who was also a representative of a political party and said that the former authorities were to blame for everything. And some of them are making promises to the outside world, and they believe them. Are they so naive? It is interesting that this is not the first time we have seen this in the past few years. For some reason, some of our Western colleagues believe that if an armed coup — preferably an armed one — takes place, democrats will always come to power — that Thomas Jefferson will always take charge of the whole thing. But where do we see anybody in Kyiv in power who might have a serious reputation in democratic politics? There are no such people there. Have these pseudo-democrats done anything to ensure that something resembling democracy will emerge even in Kyiv? In the Verkhovna Rada there are nothing but fistfights. Anyone who protests is forcibly ejected. Just as there were before, there are military camps on the Maidan; none of the far right-wingers have been disarmed. And these democrats, having failed to establish any kind of democracy in their stronghold in Kyiv, are now seeking to establish democracy — or law and order, as some of our colleagues have said — by sending armed forces into south-eastern Ukraine. There is your virtual reality. A number of my colleagues have approvingly mentioned the elections of 25 May. They are being prepared for, and we do not know how it will all get done, but who is worrying about that here? I have to agree with my Ukrainian colleague — I do not recall exactly what he said — that there must be a radical break with the accursed past, a radical change. But now the Ukrainian people are being asked to buy a pig in a poke. They are being told to go and elect a president on 25 May, but the kind of power that president will wield is completely unclear. What sort of Government will he preside over? Will he have the greater authority or will the Prime Minister? That was clearly the logical path for the intended agreement of 21 February — start out with constitutional reforms, then follow those with presidential elections. But no, that has all been turned on its head and some elections for deputies are being pushed forward. Is this really democracy? Is this really the way to a break with the past and the building of a new democratic Ukraine? Last of all, regarding the negotiations in Geneva — which we hope will take place — we are preparing diligently for them, if they are not torpedoed by these reckless activities of forces in south-eastern Ukraine. But how will Ukraine prepare for the negotiations? How will our Western partners prepare for it? That is an important question for us. It may not be a big secret, but as some of our colleagues know, we have tried through various formats to find a way to involve representatives of the region. Since the authorities themselves are incapable of launching a dialogue, we thought it might be done through this format. But the response to our proposal was negative. Let us see what will come of the Geneva meeting. Of course, we would hope that it would genuinely put Ukraine on a path to normal development whereby every region, every ethnic and religious group would know what to expect tomorrow. And then at that point we will be able to address Ukraine’s economic problems. We have invited our partners to participate in a dialogue on that subject, including through the letter that, as we know, President Putin sent to a number of Heads of European States.","I would like to thank Mr. Šimonović for his briefing today. I would also like to thank him and the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine for producing the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) published yesterday. The United Kingdom welcomes the report and its findings. To date, it is the most comprehensive and independent assessment of the human rights situation in Ukraine since the onset of the crisis. It is therefore an important contribution to our discussions on the situation in Ukraine. Attempts to discredit the report as biased or politically motivated, as my Russian colleague has just done, lack all credibility. The OHCHR report is clear: human rights violations were a root cause of the popular protests that began in November last year. The report found that since the change of Government in late February, allegations of human rights violations had decreased. But we do not underestimate the magnitude of the task ahead. In that regard, it is encouraging that the OHCHR report finds “clear indications of a willingness by the present Government to ensure a break with past injustices and to elaborate a new vision for Ukraine’s future”. The United Kingdom is fully committed to supporting Ukraine in that endeavour. The OHCHR report comprehensively refutes assertions made by the Russian Federation in the Chamber and elsewhere to justify its illegal intervention in Ukraine. I will give just three examples. First, on 1 March, President Putin requested authority to use Russia’s armed forces in Ukraine on the basis that there was “a threat to the lives of citizens of the Russian Federation, our compatriots and the personnel of the armed forces”. That oft-repeated claim underpinned Russia’s justification for military intervention in Ukraine. But the OHCHR report concludes that in fact attacks against the ethnic Russian community in Ukraine were “neither systematic nor widespread”. It further assesses that “Russian-speakers have not been subject to threats in Crimea”. That finding supports those of other independent authorities, including the High Commissioner on National Minorities of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, who also found no evidence of violations or threats to the lives of Russian-speakers. Secondly, Russia bases its justification for the illegal annexation of Crimea on the legitimacy of the 16 March referendum. On 18 March, in his address to the Russian Duma, President Putin said, “a referendum was held in Crimea on 16 March in full compliance with democratic procedures and international norms”. In stark contrast to that bold assertion, the report concludes that “the presence of paramilitary and so-called self-defence groups as well as soldiers in uniform without insignia, widely believed to be from the Russian Federation, was not conducive to an environment in which voters could freely exercise their right to hold opinions and the right to freedom of expression”. The report also states, “the OHCHR delegation received many reports of vote rigging”, including cases of non-Ukrainian citizens participating in the referendum, as well as individuals voting numerous times in different locations. Overall, the report expresses “serious concern about violations of the civil and political rights of the inhabitants of Crimea”. It cites cases of abduction, unlawful arrest and detention, harassment and violence against peaceful demonstrators, arbitrary arrest and torture. It also expresses deep concern at the consequences of introducing Russian citizenship and estimates that 3,000 Crimean Tatars have been displaced. Lastly, the report contains damning evidence that Russia has used propaganda and misinformation to exacerbate tensions and destabilize Ukraine. It says that the Russian State television and radio broadcasting company has been “disguising information about Kyiv events” in an attempt to justify Crimea’s return to the Russian Federation. Moreover, the report states that greatly exaggerated stories and misinformed reports were “systematically used to create a climate of fear and insecurity” to support Russia’s case for the annexation of Crimea. Turning to current events, the United Kingdom fully supports the right of freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. Those Ukrainians who wish to demonstrate against the Government are entitled to do so, provided that they do so peacefully. But there is a line. Well-equipped paramilitary units armed with automatic weapons are not peaceful protesters. A legitimate sovereign State must insist on a monopoly of the use of force. We express particular concern as Mr. Šimonović did in his briefing today about the arming of protesters and their transformation into quasi-paramilitary forces. Yesterday, the Ukrainian Government began an operation to restore law and order in Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian Prime Minister stated that operations would proceed gradually, responsibly and prudently. The Foreign Minister emphasized that the operations were initiated only after all other means to resolve the situation had been exhausted. We have received assurances that the operation will comply fully with Ukrainian and international law, safeguard human rights and uphold Ukraine’s international obligations. The Ukrainian Government has acted responsibly throughout the crisis, even in the face of immense provocation, not least the illegal annexation of its territory and despite continuing interference from Russia. We therefore have confidence that Ukrainian security forces will continue to act proportionately and in the interests of all citizens of Ukraine. We have heard from the Permanent Representative of Russia today a new fantasy narrative about developments in eastern Ukraine. I have no doubt that future independent reports from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights will prove that new narrative to be as false as the Russian narrative on Crimea has comprehensively been shown to be. We remind Russia that it cannot use the situation in Ukraine, for which it bears significant responsibility, as a pretext for further illegal military activity. Our appeal to Russia is simple: stop interfering in the internal affairs of Ukraine, move your troops away from Ukraine’s borders, rescind the authorization to use military force in Ukraine and enter into dialogue. The European Union wants to see Russia as a partner, as a friend and as an ally. A stable, peaceful and prosperous Ukraine is just as much in Russia’s interest as it is in our own. Rather than pursuing a strategy of destabilization, Russia should take its place at the negotiating table and environment explain its concerns. We hope that the quadrapartite talks scheduled for 17 April will provide just such an opportunity.","I wish to thank Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for his briefing today and for his diligent work on this controversial issue. We meet today to discuss the work of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine and the timely report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. After weeks of Russian disinformation and propaganda, the report gives us yet another opportunity to focus on facts. The independent and impartial reporting we have heard today is essential to prevent the kind of distortions that may lead to further instability in an already combustible situation, a situation that continues to grow more dangerous every day. Today’s remarks by the representative of the Russian Federation, in which the independent report provided by the United Nations was disparaged — indeed, slandered as biased and unfounded — is deeply worrying. If we do not like the message, the Russian strategy appears to be, metaphorically, shoot the messenger. Even if those attacks are attacks on the entire international community, which asks the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide independent reporting, we urge the United Nations to continue to provide independent reporting and not to be deterred by slander and intimidation being practiced by those who do not like facts that have proven inconvenient and truths that credibly repute Russia’s false and self-justifying claims. Let us be clear: the actions the world witnessed in Crimea and the denials of Russian involvement in the lead up to its illegal annexation and occupation are repeating themselves in eastern Ukraine. Again, a region has been transformed almost overnight from a state of relative calm to manufactured unrest. Over the last several days, heavily armed pro-Russian separatists have seized the city administration, police stations and other Government buildings in 11 cities in Donetsk oblast. Every major city in the region has at least one building under occupation. It is clear that those actions were not a set of spontaneous events or home-grown, but rather a well-orchestrated professional campaign of incitement, separatism and sabotage of the Ukrainian State. And there is substantial evidence of involvement from Russia, which is now diverting attention from its own actions, its own territorial expansion, its own fear-mongering, by trying to change the subject. Well, it will not work. The contrast between the actions of the Ukrainian Government and those of the Russian troops could not be starker. Ukrainian security forces have responded more carefully and in more measured ways to provocations in the east that would be difficult for any of us to accept in our own countries. The Ukrainian Government has repeatedly sought to negotiate with the armed groups that have seized public buildings and established unauthorized road blocks in eastern Ukraine, in an effort to resolve the situation peacefully through dialogue. Ukrainian officials have offered amnesty. We appreciate the Government’s statements that any actions it undertakes will be gradual and responsible. Contrary to the conspiracy theories put forth by the Russian representative today, we continue to call for restraint, privately and publicly. Obviously, the best way to de-escalate the situation is for the armed militants to leave the buildings that they have seized. While the report speaks to an earlier period in the crisis, it is important to note that even several weeks ago the monitoring mission had already received allegations that some of the people stoking unrest in the region were not Ukrainian citizens, but in fact agitators coming from the Russian Federation. Obviously, it is a critical question whether Russia is continuing its policy of seeking to destabilize and ultimately annex land from its neighbour. For purposes of establishing the truth, it is essential that the United Nations human rights monitoring mission go forward with its work and that it have full access to every part of the country, including Crimea. The United States commends the Ukraine Government for facilitating the mission’s activities and for supporting the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s (OSCE) ongoing efforts to monitor every aspect of the scheduled 25 May elections. Now let us consider some of the truths set forth in the High Commissioner’s report. From December 2013 until February 2014, the Berkut special police and other elements of the federal security apparatus used excessive force against anti-Government protesters. That deadly violence did not end until former President Yanukovych abandoned his office and fled the country. Since late February when the new Government assumed office, evidence of human rights abuses has decreased dramatically, except in Crimea, where Russian policies threaten the rights of Ukrainians, Crimean Tatars and other minority groups. Let me emphasize that according to the new independent report, the only region of Ukraine that has suffered a rapid deterioration in human rights is the part over which the Government in Kyiv has least control. In Crimea, where the role of Russian authorities is as profound as it is illegal, journalists and human rights defenders have faced harassment and torture, censorship is common and the presence of paramilitary and soldiers “widely believed to be from the Russian Federation” has sharply inhibited freedom of expression. The report raises valid concerns about the introduction of Russian citizenship in a region that does not belong to Russia and about discrimination against Ukrainian citizens inside their own country and a plethora of practical issues related to property ownership, pensions, wages, health care, labour rights, education and access to justice. The new report also examines the allegation repeated over and over again by Russian officials that there have been systematic attacks against ethnic Russians in Crimea and in eastern Ukraine and that Jewish communities have also come under threat. The reality is that there have been a few isolated incidents against individual members belonging to minority groups, and we should and do condemn those incidents. But the report makes clear that those incidents were neither widespread nor a reflection of Government policy. On the contrary, the report presents vivid evidence that the Ukraine Government has sought actively to safeguard the rights of all citizens within its jurisdiction. It is revealing that while Russia has sought to deny the realities cited in the United Nations latest report, the leaders of Ukraine are making a good-faith effort to implement its recommendations. Among other initiatives, they are moving ahead with constitutional reform, plans to decentralize power, preparations for the election and initiatives to curb the corruption that flourished so blatantly under the former President. Overall, the new Government has acted with tremendous restraint under extraordinarily difficult conditions. There will always be more to do, but the allegation that the Government is primarily to blame for the present tensions is completely baseless. Before moving to my conclusion, I want to draw on the even-handed recommendations in the United Nations human rights report in order to show that the charges against the United Nations are inaccurate. Among the report’s recommendations to the Government of Ukraine are the following: ensure accountability for all human rights violations during the unrest, ensure inclusivity and equal participation in public affairs and political life, prevent media manipulation, combat intolerance and extremism and implement measures to eradicate corruption. The recommendations to the authorities in Crimea include: actively resolve cases of missing persons, take all measures needed to protect the rights of persons affected by the changing institutional and legal framework, including citizenship, disarm and disband paramilitary units and investigate hate speech and media manipulation. Those are not the recommendations of a biased report. The release of the human rights monitoring report should remind us all of our responsibilities. The Government of Ukraine has a responsibility to continue its reform initiatives and to ensure inclusivity and respect for the human rights of all groups. The people of Ukraine have a duty to cooperate with their Government and fellow citizens in seeking to resolve disputes through peaceful means. The Russian Federation has an obligation to fulfil its commitments under international law, to respect the rights and the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine and to back its professed desire for stability with actions designed to achieve that goal, instead of its opposite. The Russian Federation must move its troops back from the border region, withdraw its forces from Crimea and cease all efforts to destabilize Ukraine. The international community has a responsibility to support the people of Ukraine in their desire to build a strong and united country with a robust democracy and effective national and regional institutions. We have a collective responsibility as well to do all we can to prevent further bloodshed and to find a peaceful and just conclusion to what has been a tragic and unnecessary crisis. Tomorrow in Geneva, senior representatives from Ukraine, Russia, the European Union and the United States are scheduled to meet to discuss de-escalation, demobilization, support for elections and constitutional reform. My Government looks forward to participating in that meeting as an opportunity to resolve the crisis through diplomacy before it is too late.",,,,,,,,,,,"I thank you, Madam President, for convening this meeting of the Security Council to discuss the report on the human rights situation in Ukraine. I am grateful to Assistant Secretary-General Ivan Šimonović for presenting the report today.
Today’s meeting is being held with the following fact on everyone’s mind: it is only because of the Russian military aggression, which should be unimaginable in the twenty-first century yet is unfolding in plain sight, that the situation in Ukraine has emerged on the Council’s agenda. Ukraine welcomes the publication of the report, which reflects the situation in my country in the field of human rights objectively enough.
Unlike the previous Administration, the new Government in Ukraine is willing and ready to embrace recommendations aimed at promoting human rights and the rule of law in our country. At the same time, we hope that the other Government mentioned in the report will also take specific actions to stop and prevent human rights violations.
The document strongly rejects the allegations of violations of the rights of Russian minorities in Ukraine, which were used as a reason for Russia’s military aggression against our country and the annexation of Crimea, which was declared illegal by the General Assembly.
My Russian colleague stated today that the Russian language is in danger in Ukraine. Let me give the Council some comparative figures on the situation concerning the protection of the language rights of the several million Ukrainians in the Russian Federation and the Russians in Ukraine. These figures are based on the report of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s High Commissioner on National Minorities, dated March-April 2009. I ask members to please compare the figures.
On secondary schools, there are no Ukrainian secondary schools in the Russian Federation for at least 2 million people. In Ukraine, there are 101,256 Russian secondary schools. On publications, seven Ukrainian newspapers are published at the expense of the local authorities and Ukrainian organizations of the Russian Federation. Financial support at the federal level is not provided to ensure the information needs of the Ukrainian community in the Russian Federation. There are 1,176 newspapers published in the Russian language in Ukraine.
On broadcasting, there is only one Ukrainian broadcast radio programme in Russia. Russian language television and radio programmes in Ukraine consists of about 74 per cent of the total broadcasts in Ukraine.
The Russian Permanent Representative today stated that there was growing anti-Semitism and neo-Nazism in Ukraine. And the Russian side is concerned about the fact that this is not reflected in today’s human rights report. Allow me to quote some excerpts from the joint letter addressed not long ago to Russian President Vladimir Putin by an association made up of 266 Jewish organizations in Ukraine.
“The speculation about the violent Ukrainization and the prohibition to speak in Russian, which was always stressed in the Russian media, should remain on these authors’ conscience. Mr. President, your confidence expressed on the growth of anti-Semitism in Ukraine does not meet the real facts. Perhaps you were confused, indicating Ukraine instead of Russia, where Jewish organizations have documented the growth of anti-Semitism last year.“We were and still we are being frightened by the fact that Bandera followers and fascists are rushing to power in Ukraine, and we should expect the Jewish pogroms. Yes, we are aware that political opposition and the social powers that achieved positive changes in the executive branch of the country are made up of different groups. The nationalists are among them, but even the most marginal of them do not allow themselves to express anti-Semitism and other forms of xenophobia. And what we know is that our nationalists are under the control of civil society and the new Government of Ukraine, which is not the case with the Russian neo-Nazis, who are encouraged by your secret services”.
Today our Russian colleague also touched upon the case concerning Mr. Tsarev and Mr. Dobkin as candidates in the presidential election. I am authorized to say that we condemn all forms of violence, especially when it concerns opposition leaders and candidates for President. In that context, work must be done by the police, who are obliged to carry out a proper investigation and to submit it to the court. Today, the Ukrainian Parliament considered those cases, and we expect that they will be assessed and that the Office of the Prosecutor will then comment.
I would also like to note something interesting in that situation. Coupled with the aggressive actions against Ukraine, that situation cannot be excluded as provocation from our opponents. I point out that Mr. Tsarev was attacked by unknown assailants. Those who rescued him were from the Right Sector — precisely the forces that Russia has consistently accused of demonstrating extreme intolerance towards it. Mr. Tsarev openly thanked the representatives of that group for rescuing him. This story was broadcast widely by Ukraine’s main news channels. Russian television channels showed only part of that interview. We have the full version on a disk and will give it to our Russian colleagues.
We call on the States Members of the United Nations to take close note of the human rights violations detailed in the report before and during the Crimea pseudo-referendum of 16 March. The include harassment, arbitrary arrests, torture, violations of the freedom of expression, media freedom, access to information and the protection of journalists. Particular attention is rightly given to violations of the rights of the inhabitants of the peninsula under the Russian occupation. The most vulnerable communities in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea are considered to be the Crimean Tartars and Ukrainians, who were intimidated and forced to leave their homes because of the lack of a safe environment and the oppression of their rights and freedoms. Tartar leaders consider the situation as the third act of genocide against their ethnic group in the past century.
Given the ongoing systematic violations of human rights on the Crimean peninsula, the Ukrainian side insists that the situation in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea should remain under the radar of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and its mission and other international monitoring mechanisms. In that respect, we welcome the intention of the United Nations monitoring mission to establish its sub-office in Simferopol. Mindful of the provisions of General Assembly resolution 68/262, entitled “Territorial integrity of Ukraine”, is is alarming that — along with an analysis of recent developments and factors in the eastern regions of Ukraine — the document reports on external interference in the situation, in particular the participation in the protests and clashes by individuals who arrived from Russia. At the Security Council meeting held on Sunday, 13 April (see S/PV.7154), we gave some facts about such interference. One can find much more evidence by visiting the official site of the Ukrainian Secret Service.
Ukraine is surprised that the only criticism of the peace enforcement operation in Ukraine comes from the Russian Federation. The Council will recall that this country is one of the most frequent users of counter-terrorism tools against its citizens. I would like to draw the Council’s attention to the fact that Russia uses the same strategy in all counter-terrorism operations: if the enemy does not surrender, it is stormed at any cost. Dozens of examples could be given. The enforcement operation in Ukraine is being undertaken to protect people and to restore law and order in some regions of Ukraine. The operation is targeted exclusively at armed groups who are committing acts of a criminal nature, including the seizure of administrative buildings, police and military facilities and airports. Those armed groups are strongly supported by the Russian special operations force units, illegally infiltrated into the territory of Ukraine.
My Russian colleague mentioned today that the the first blood has been spilled in eastern Ukraine, that of five Ukrainian peace enforcement officers who were killed in a well-prepared attack overseen by the Russian officer Ihor Strielkov.The Council can find detailed information on the website of the Ukrainian Secret Service: www.sbu.gov.ua.
It is in that light that we look forward to the mission’s next report, which will focus on eastern Ukraine.
United Nations experts have stated clearly that a number of human rights violations in other parts of Ukraine were a legacy of the previous Government, which became one of the main reasons that caused the Ukrainian mass protests that took place from November 2013 to February 2014. The reasons posing a challenge for decades to human rights in Ukraine generally, and in its eastern and southern regions in particular, are well known, that is, poverty, a high level of child mortality, unemployment and dangerous working conditions, especially in the coal-mining industry. As a result, basic human rights and principles outlined in the Constitution of Ukraine were not always respected in my country.
The only way Ukraine can cope with those problems is to dramatically change its inherited status quo in order to build an open, democratic civil society. The newly formed Parliament and Government of Ukraine have repeatedly stated their commitment to reforms designed to eliminate those vestiges of the past, and we are grateful to the authors of the report for noting positive trends in the new Ukrainian authorities’ activities that indicate their willingness to ensure a break with past injustices and elaborate a new vision of Ukraine’s future. The action plan for the Government presented by the new Cabinet covers the problems of each and every region of Ukraine. It focuses on the practical needs of the population, including ethnic minorities. What we need, in order to achieve those goals, is to be left in peace by Russia.
We greatly appreciate the role the United Nations is playing in normalizing the situation in Ukraine, and we are ready to enhance our cooperation with its human rights bodies in order to give proper consideration to human rights issues in implementing our wide-ranging reforms. Those reforms are aimed at ensuring the rule of law, developing a democratic, pluralistic society, eliminating corruption, complying with social standards and protecting the rights of minorities. The real watershed in this process will be the presidential elections to be held in Ukraine on 25 May. We are determined to have them whatever the circumstances, and to make them the most transparent elections in the history of independent Ukraine.
I thank the Council for its support and understanding. I have come to realize that it is sometimes useless to comment on certain things, since our Russian colleagues will stand by their opinion and represent the situation the way they want, regardless.
That is the reason for the virtual reality that our Russian colleagues have constructed, where they live in their own world while everyone else says the same thing. Whether Mr. Churkin wants to or not, he will have to take part in a discussion of the issue of Crimea because it is Ukrainian territory. It may be temporarily occupied, but until it is returned we will discuss it. We have seen the entire world lend its support for Ukraine on this subject.
It is a shame that the Russian Ambassador should use such language as “lies” and so forth when commenting on his colleagues’ words. It is a shame that neither he nor his deputies attended the Security Council’s meeting with the delegation from the Crimea, led by the well-known human rights champion Mustafa Dzhemilev, who spent 15 years in Soviet prisons for defending the rights of his people. He said what I said when I repeated his words, which the Russian Ambassador called lies and provocations. So the Crimean Tartars will now hear that the Russians consider their position to be mere lies and provocations.
I have no further comment, because everything said to date consists yet again of manipulation and distortion in a style we are all familiar with. I think Council members for their attention, their support and their patience.. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I wish to thank the Nigerian presidency for organizing this public briefing. I would also like to convey my appreciation to Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Ivan Šimonović for his briefing.
The report presented on 15 April by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights squarely refutes Russia’s inflammatory narrative, which it uses to justify its illegal actions in Ukraine. While the report points out that Ukraine suffered from human rights violations, lack of accountability, corruption and mismanagement of resources, as well as a lack of a system of checks and balances and a lack of free elections, the blame is placed on the previous regime.
The report indicates that underlying human rights violations were among the root causes of the popular protests that led to a change in Government. The adoption of restrictive anti-protest laws and the excessive use of force by Berkut special police and other security forces under Yanukovich transformed a peaceful demonstration and led to the violence and deaths that ensued. The report indicates, however, that since the current Government took power at the end of February, tensions have decreased, along with the allegations of human rights violations.
In Crimea, the main concerns are linked to the Russian-sponsored developments leading to and the situation after the so-called referendum, which has had a direct impact on the enjoyment of human rights by local inhabitants, especially the indigenous Tatar community, who chose to boycott the referendum. Their situation has just been described. Many people may be forced to leave their homes and face other consequences arising from Crimea’s takeover. That is also confirmed by the special monitoring mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The report also highlights the highly questionable character of the referendum, which was held in an environment of intimidation by armed groups and a total lack of media freedom. As Council members will recall, the plebiscite was organized in a particularly hurried manner, in the absence of established election practices and election observation, without a public debate on its merits and provided exclusively for a secessionist option.
The report indicates too that in eastern Ukraine grievances with regard to the failure of the central Government to represent interests have a history long predating the current Government. The report also states that violations of the human rights of the ethnic minorities in eastern Ukraine, Crimea and elsewhere in Ukraine have been neither widespread nor systematic. That is clearly confirmed by the most recent statement by United Nations Special Rapporteur on minority issues, Rita Izsák, who has concluded that the overwhelming majority of minorities and others described harmonious inter-ethnic and interfaith relations and conditions of non-discrimination in all spheres of life. She stated that “The current human rights situation of minorities in Ukraine and the civil and political, economic, social and cultural conditions ... cannot justify any violent actions or incitement ... by any party, national or international”.
That is exactly what we have been saying all along. Whatever the issues regarding the human and minority rights situation in Ukraine, Crimea or eastern Ukraine in particular, none of those issues can ever justify the invasion and annexation of Crimea or the ongoing destabilization of eastern Ukraine. Those issues could, and should have been, resolved by way of established and well-tried peaceful instruments, with the assistance of regional organizations such as the OSCE and the Council of Europe, as well as the United Nations.
Furthermore, the report notes that there are today positive changes under way in Ukraine, or under consideration, such as a willingness to break with past injustices and to elaborate a new vision of the country. Those conclusions, contained in the report, are confirmed by the current Government’s efforts to strengthen the rule of law, combat corruption, ensure minority rights and address the issue of decentralization. In fact, acting President Turchynov recently proposed holding a referendum on the decentralization of the country together with the national elections to be held on 25 May.
All of the foregoing points to the fact that the crisis provoked in Ukraine is not about the protection of one particular ethnic minority or language minority, or about Ukraine’s alleged extremist radicalism. But we knew that all along as well, as various previous conclusions by senior international representatives, including those of the OSCE, have repeatedly repudiated such allegations. Among other things, this is about Ukraine’s destabilization with a view to obstructing and preventing the 25 May elections, which the interim Government in Kyiv announced the minute it was appointed, for fear that power may slip out of the fingers of the likes of Yanukovic and his corrupt cronies.
This is also about a naked land grab and Russia’s greater political and military ambitions. In a disturbing instance of déjà vu, once again in clear violation of Ukraine’s Constitution and accepted norms of international behaviour, heavily armed militants without any insignia are occupying local Government buildings and declaring independence, which is a sad caricature of self-determination in defiance of national and international law.
Furthermore, the systematic and well-oiled propaganda war against Ukraine and its provisional leadership is an extremely dangerous game, because as we have seen time and again from various situations around the world, including recently in the Central African Republic, it is much too easy to release the arms-wielding genie out of the bottle, a genie of incitement and hate, but infinitely more difficult to contain it afterwards.
We therefore urge the Russian side to stop its disinformation and anti-Ukrainian and anti-European propaganda campaign before it is too late. International bodies, Europe and Ukraine have repeatedly called for the path of restraint and dialogue. The way towards that path are still open as we await the holding of the quadrilateral meeting to take place in Geneva on 17 April. We once again call on the Russian Federation to pursue that path.
Much remains to be done for the current and future Governments of Ukraine. Fighting corruption — and we welcome the fact that the relevant legislation is now being put in place to improve access to education, health and social services — providing real equality for all its citizens, addressing the deficiencies of the justice system and combating impunity, which was so common in the country, are the main issues of concern where the international community, including the United Nations, the OSCE and the Council of Europe again can readily provide further assistance.
Impartial reporting on human rights violations will help to prevent the manipulation of information by whomever. We therefore support continuous reporting by the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine to ensure a regular and continuous flow of updates on the situation in the country. We also have to provide necessary mid- and long-term funding for the mission going well beyond June. The mission must continue its work throughout the entire territory of Ukraine, including Crimea.
Other human rights monitoring instruments are also necessary. We look forward to receiving the findings of the visit to Ukraine by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on minority issues from 7 to 13 April. We welcome equests by other thematic mandate holders under the special procedures of the Human Rights Council, such as the Special Rapporteur on internally displaced persons, to visit Ukraine and report on their findings.
It is also crucial to ensure independent monitoring of the human rights situation in Crimea specifically. We call on the occupying authorities to allow the human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine to work in Crimea, including the opening of a sub-office in Simferopol. United Nations officials should continue to visit Crimea and report on the situation of all ethnic minorities, on media freedom and human rights.
The people of Russia and Ukraine have become victims of the propaganda and disinformation that provoked and fanned unconstitutional actions by local militants, with external assistance. The situation is very tense, but a reversal of course is still possible. It is time to heed the countless calls to de-escalate and for Moscow to stop interfering into Ukraine’s internal affairs.
The current Government is set to address human rights violations, language policy, the rights of ethnic minorities, the decentralization of power and corruption, and to strengthen accountability and the rule of law. It is in our common interests that this Government and the future Government of Ukraine should be allowed to carry out that work unobstructed. We must also support its efforts to ensure that a free and fair election on 25 May, with the participation of all Ukraine in all its rich diversity, can take place. ","I shall now make a few remarks in my national capacity.
I also want to thank Assistant Secretary-General Ivan Šimonović for his briefing on the human rights situation in Ukraine. We have studied the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the human rights situation in Ukraine and note that it is comprehensive.
We are encouraged by the relentless and consistent engagement of the United Nations in Ukraine. That is exemplified by the establishment of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, the readiness of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide testimonial assistance for legislative reforms and the recent high-level visits by the Secretary-General, Under-Secretary-General Feltman, Senior Adviser Robert Serry and Mr. Šimonović.
We believe in the central role of the United Nations in de-escalating tensions in Ukraine. The United Nations provides an impartial platform and professional expertise, which are both essential ingredients in the efforts to ensure that human rights are respected and protected in Ukraine. Independent monitoring and analysis of the human rights situation will outline technical, legal or other assistance needs and may contribute to addressing the root causes of the violence. The human rights issues linked to the current crisis in Ukraine need to be comprehensively addressed within the framework of a peaceful and negotiated resolution of the crisis. The authorities must continue to engage all groups in the country and assure them that their concerns will be addressed.
The ongoing rebellion in eastern Ukraine flagrantly rubs salt in the wound and exacerbates an already tenuous political situation, with far-reaching implications for human rights, peace and security. We all know that it is an established fact that violations of human rights often occur in situations of conflict. That underscores the imperative for a speedy political and diplomatic resolution of the crisis in Ukraine. We urge all concerned parties to cease beating the drums of war. They must work assiduously to ease the escalating tensions and embrace dialogue and all its ramifications, for the larger interests of the people of Ukraine. All of us around this table have expressed the hope that the meeting to take place tomorrow, 17 April, will lead to a resolution of the crisis. I hope that our hopes are not misplaced. I hope that our hopes will be justified.
I now resume my functions as President of the Council.
I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine. ","At the outset, I would like to thank the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Mr. Ivan Šimonović, for his briefing to the Council on the human rights situation in Ukraine, as well as for his efforts and those of the human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine. The delegation of Jordan would also like to underscore its support for the mission’s work and the importance for all parties to cooperate with it in carrying out the recommendations contained in the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on Ukraine, particularly in light of the delicate and sensitive situation experienced by the country.
The report reveals the direct relationship between the widespread and significant human rights violations, including the right to freedom of expression, the previous Government’s corruption, and the protests and insecurity that have swept Ukraine since November 2013. Attacks on the protesters, particularly in Maidan Square, and the use of excessive force against them have led to rapid political changes in Ukraine, the establishment of a transitional Government and the appointment of an acting President. The tense situation in eastern Ukraine as a result of the ongoing rebel movement must be addressed responsibly and reasonably by all parties. As we have said previously, the Ukrainian Government has the right and is duty-bound to end the rebellion and preserve the country’s territorial integrity and unity. Given the current situation, all efforts must be made to ensure as peaceful a settlement to the rebellion as possible.
International norms and human rights must be respected in imposing the rule of law in those regions. We underscore our call to bring pressure to bear on the rebels to end their protests and engage in dialogue with the Government in Kyiv on all matters related to Ukraine’s future. By the same token, we welcome the convening of the quadripartite meeting in Geneva tomorrow, which we hope will lead to the proposal of suitable solutions to end the crisis and persuade the stakeholders to de-escalate the situation and work to restore stability and security in Ukraine.
The current situation in Ukraine requires urgent measures to be adopted and steps taken to build confidence among all parties. It is necessary to limit extremist national and political diatribes. We call upon influential Powers to use their sway to end to the problem, which underpins current events in Ukraine, especially in the eastern regions. We also underscore the need for continued dialogue between the Government of Ukraine and the country’s diverse communities, factions, linguistic groups and political parties in order to agree an appropriate political course of action that addresses the interests of all parties and charts a path for Ukraine’s future with regard to the rule of law, its institutions and human rights.
The dialogue must begin forthwith. States and influential parties must also create a climate conducive to the successful holding of presidential elections in May. Ukraine’s future depends on a successful political transition that is based on human rights, sovereignty and the rule of law and that represents all parts of society, without regard to language, ethnicity or religion.
We stress that there must be no interference in the internal affairs of Ukraine, or threat of force and that the people of Ukraine will be allowed to determine their own future. The international community must assist Ukraine at this stage of its political transition to overcome the obstacles to security and stability and preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity. ","We thank Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for his briefing on the human rights situation in Ukraine.
Chile supports the appeal made by Mr. Šimonović to ensure accountability for all human rights violations committed during the demonstrations in Kyiv that took place between December 2013 and February 2014. It is crucial that immediate measures be adopted to build trust between the interim Government and the population, while taking into account ethnic minorities in particular. Similarly, it is urgent to guarantee full respect for the rule of law, democracy and human rights in Ukraine, including the rights of all minorities.
We are particularly disturbed by the deterioration of the human rights situation in the eastern region of Ukraine, in particular violations of freedom of expression and freedom of assembly through attacks against and the harassment of activists, journalists and members of the political opposition. We urge the parties to find a peaceful solution to the crisis through direct political dialogue, to act with moderation, to abstain from adopting any unilateral measures that may increase tensions and to take part in international mediation efforts in accordance with General Assembly resolution 68/262. We hope that the meeting to be held tomorrow in Geneva, in which Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the European Union and the United States will take part, will help find a way out of the crisis.
I would conclude by welcoming the good offices that the Secretary-General continues to carry out and by highlighting the work of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on establishing the facts, reducing tensions and creating an environment conducive to the holding of presidential elections on 25 May. ","I would first like to thank Mr. Ivan Šimonović, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, for his briefing.
Chad remains deeply concerned about the situation in Ukraine, which has been marked by human rights violations and violence likely to be lead to unforeseeable and incalculable consequences. Chad condemns every form of human rights violations and violence, wherever they come from. We ask that an independent inquiry be carried out to determine the respective responsibilities of the various parties in the human rights violations that have been committed. However, we believe that it is difficult to clarify the situation with regard to human rights violations without a modicum of stability and a reduction of the prevailing tensions.
We therefore call on all the parties to exercise restraint and calm and urge them once again to give priority to finding a peaceful settlement of the crisis. We believe that a political solution is possible within the framework of direct and candid negotiations among the relevant parties, mindful of the fundamental principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the concerns of all components of Ukrainian society in all their diversity. Accordingly, we encourage all the parties to give negotiations a chance and to back the mediation efforts currently under way. We hope that the meeting scheduled for 17 April in Geneva will enable us to make progress in our search for a solution to the crisis. ","I thank Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and for his briefing. It is obviously very necessary that the Council give such careful focus on the human rights situation in Ukraine. We have heard repeated assertions about threats against particular groups, but we have seen little evidence to substantiate those assertions. Those claims have been used, however, as a justification for continuing interference in Ukraine’s affairs, including the threat and use of force, contrary to the Charter of the United Nations.
As the Council, we need to be clear-eyed and responsible about the situation on the ground and the true nature of the challenges facing the Ukrainian people. The report of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission is what the Council needs to see at this critical point in such an unstable and dangerous environment. It seems to us to provide a balanced and neutral depiction of the human rights situation and a clear picture of the events leading to the Maidan protest, the situation prior to the referendum held on 16 March in Crimea, and the current situation both in Crimea and in eastern Ukraine.
Russia has made various assertions about the motivation of the Maidan protestors. The report makes clear that human rights violations were among the root causes of the demonstrations that took place throughout Ukraine and in particular in Kyiv. The protests were not driven by a so-called fascist agenda, but were a push for a more representative and effective Government. The heavy-handed response from security forces was a catalyst for their escalation. These actions of the security forces came against a backdrop of a long-standing culture of impunity for human rights violations, including by the police. We welcome reports that the new Ukrainian authorities have committed to investigating those violations and to holding perpetrators to account.
The report also sheds light on the events in Crimea. Russia has consistently argued that Russian-speaking minorities were threatened with repression. It has used that reasoning to justify its decision to take control of and annex Crimea. The report makes clear that there was no evidence of harassment or attacks on ethnic Russians in Crimea ahead of the referendum. Misinformed reports, however, of harassment of ethnic Russians by Ukrainian extremists served to create a climate of fear.
The report notes that since the referendum of 16 March, measures have been taken in Crimea that are of deep concern from a human rights perspective. Those include the introduction of Russian citizenship, I now come to my second point. The report draws a bleak picture of the impact of Russia’s actions on the situation inside Ukraine. It describes the chain of events that led to the annexation of Crimea. It once again underscores that there was no threat to the Russian-speaking population of Crimea, a defence that is nevertheless upheld by Russia to justify its intervention. Quite the opposite, the report underscores that the risk of human rights violations now threatens the Ukrainian and Tartar populations. The United Nations must continue to take note of the human rights situation in Crimea, which is an integral part of Ukraine, as the General Assembly recalled by an overwhelming majority.
The report also underscores that the deteriorating conditions and human rights violations that preceded the holding of the referendum in Crimea on 16 March were the result of deliberate acts. The presence of soldiers in uniform without insignia, the seizure of public buildings, intimidation of the civilian population, journalists and human rights activists, the presence of foreign voters and the violent propaganda against Kyiv broadcast on Russian television channels were all coordinated and orchestrated acts. They served as a prelude to an annexation unprecedented in the twenty-first century. Today, we are seeing a similar scenario in eastern Ukraine.
In that regard, I believe that all Council members and all my colleagues here in the Chamber read the excellent article in this morning’s New York Times, which describes how Russia has established its own virtual reality, which bears no relation to the real situation. My Russian friend’s statement today shows, I believe, just how accurate and how true to the reality that article is. Let us recall the past. Participants will perhaps recall being told of 600,000 refugeees fleeing the Ukrainian terror, who seem to have disappeared from one day to the next. We were told that there were no Russian soldiers in Crimea, while on YouTube we could see lorries with Russian army number plates.
Today, the same disinformation continues. We are told of peaceful protesters, while again on the Internet one can see that they are heavily armed militia. We are told that there is no Russian intervention, while again on the Internet one can see soldiers without insignia, flaunting weapons with which only the Russian army is equipped. We are told that a fascist terror prevails in Kyiv, while we know very well that if we were to go to Kyiv we would see that calm prevails. We are told that Jews in Ukraine are threatened, while the two Ukrainian Jewish organizations themselves say that they are not threatened. I could mention many more examples, but never was a statement clearly so far from the reality that, thanks to the Internet, we all can see on the computer.
Ukraine is cornered and under attack. On Sunday, right here, it was ordered not to react. One cannot imagine that it would suffer without reacting to the aggression to which it was first subjected a month ago, condemned by the General Assembly in resolution 68/262, and which it is again experiencing in the east of the country. We welcome the restraint of the Ukrainian security forces, who seek to respond in a proportional way to the unprecedented destabilizing actions against them, organized from abroad.
We call on Russia to commit to de-escalation and to condemning, together with the rest of the Council, the attempts at destabilization in eastern Ukraine. Furthermore, we call on Russia to stop trapping itself in a spiral to extremes that can lead only to tragedy. It must withdraw its troops from the border. It must cease its destabilizing activities. It must stop shouting about an immiment civil war. No one is deceived by the scenario of the arsonist firefighter — an unsubtle picture and not even a real semblance of credibility.
The situation is now extremely serious. A meeting that will bring together Russia, the United States, the European Union and Ukraine will be held in Geneva tomorrow. That event is crucial, and we call on parties to remain calm and to exercise restraint. In the case of failure or if Russia were to seek to avoid that meeting, new sanctions would be inevitable. That is not our preferred path. We will be firm. Fully legitimate authorities must be established in Kyiv. Elections must be held on 25 May, and we will not allow Russia either to prevent them from taking place or to discredit them. ",,,,"I thank you, Madam President, for convening this briefing on the human rights situation in Ukraine. I thank Mr. Ivan Šimonović, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, for his briefing and for his efforts in reporting and ensuring human rights in Ukraine.
The report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights issued yesterday indicates worrying patterns of human rights violations, mainly born of the current crisis. The report also indicates a culture of effective impunity, including torture, extortion, arbitrary detention and corruption. It is unfortunate that the situation has bloomed into a deadly crisis in which over 120 people have lost their lives due to gunfire and severe beatings, while 100 remain missing.
The situation in Ukraine again proves that there are fault lines in our preventive measures. Nonetheless, it is our view that the international community still has a chance to prevent a further deterioration of the situation in Ukraine. We again welcome the establishment of a United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, which we support. We believe that we can build on the work of the mission to support Ukraine in its efforts to build the State that Ukrainians deserve.
It is incumbent on the Ukrainian Government and indeed a priority to build confidence between the authorities and the people and among the various communities, with a view to reassuring all people throughout Ukraine that their concerns will be addressed, especially the Russian-speaking community. It is time to ensure the inclusion and equal participation of all Ukrainians in public affairs, rather than adopting legislation regarding a lustration policy that would lead to further isolation and radicalism.
In eastern Ukraine, the situation on the ground has deteriorated in the past few days, instigating a dire need for a viable political solution. We express concern about the seizure and illegal occupation of public buildings and infrastructure by armed protestors, and stress the need for security forces to avoid any excessive use of force while restoring the necessary public order.
In the meantime, we are extremely concerned by the increased rhetoric and negative propaganda that have exacerbated a situation, and in some cases driven decisions taken to prevent the possibility of stakeholders reconciling. Once again, we reiterate our call on all parties to de-escalate the crisis and engage in genuine dialogue, with respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. In that regard, we look forward to the talks among Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the European Union and the United States of America to be held tomorrow in Geneva. We hope that the meeting will contribute to a sustainable political solution in Ukraine and the region.
Let me conclude by saying that the people of Ukraine will judge us by our action, or lack of action. Failing them is not an option. It is time to support a truly Ukrainian-led solution, with the support of the region and the larger international community.","Allow me to begin by thanking Mr. Ivan Šimonović, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, for his briefing on the human rights situation in Ukraine.
What else can we say except to reiterate that Argentina is following with great concern the increasingly tense situation in Ukraine, in particular in the eastern part of the country, and its potential consequences for the region’s stability? What more is there to say that to reiterate that we are deeply concerned that the threat of violent clashes may mean paying a heavy price and hamper the possibility of finding a way out of the current crisis and of stabilizing the situation in the country?
The delegation of Argentina therefore reaffirms once again our belief that we must uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, in particular that of non-intervention — be it military, political or economic — in the internal affairs of other States. We understand that the actions of any State or international organization must show due respect for Ukraine’s management of its internal affairs and its future.
As Mr. Šimonović informed the Council, human rights violations were reported in Ukraine in the lead-up to the protests of November 2013. Serious human rights violations were also committed during the protests and afterwards. Although the report notes that denunciations of human rights violations have eased off since the new authorities in Kyiv assumed power, serious concerns remain among sectors of the population with regard to respect for the rights of minorities, and those concerns and fears have been raised as a result of certain attacks or threats against various minorities. Undoubtedly we need to have more information and we must continue to follow those events closely.
In that context, the availability of impartial information on the human rights situation will contribute not just to ensuring accountability for human rights violations and abuses, but will also help to prevent any manipulation of such information, which would only exacerbate a climate of impunity, insecurity and violence. At the same time, we believe that the exhaustive investigation into the violations and abuses that have taken place since the beginning of the protests in Maidan Square, regardless of who the perpetrators are, and the sentencing of those individuals will help to restore calm and foster institutional normalization which is needed in Ukraine. Measures undoubtedly need to be taken to build confidence among the various regions and ethnic communities and provide security to all Ukrainians throughout the country that their primary concerns and legitimate demands will be addressed. We must also end the incitement to hatred, discrimination, hostility and violence. We are not saying anything new as a delegation. We are simply recognizing the difficult situation in Ukraine, which cannot be resolved by unilateral actions. We insist on the need to avoid any action that would make the situation even more complex and complicate the search for a peaceful political solution to the crisis. All the parties must work together to calm the situation, must show maximum restraint and must contribute to an inclusive dialogue.
What can those of us who hope that those who will be meeting in Geneva on 17 April will have a constructive dialogue and that they will find a peaceful political solution to the crisis? As members of the international community, we can do a great deal. We can hope that the much-needed meeting of 17 April will take place in a different climate. Those of us who will not attend that meeting must make sure that we do not detract from it. We must recall that human rights are not anyone’s property but everyone’s responsibility. We must recall that the Charter of the United Nations is not made up of isolated chapters or loose principles, but is rather an unbreakable whole. With that positive attitude, we express our desire for a positive discussion to be held so that Ukraine can find the serenity it so sorely needs. ","I thank Mr. Ivan Šimonović, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, for his briefing.
The discussions of recent weeks in the Council have shown that not all members have the same assessment of the situation in Ukraine. We have often witnessed here a dialogue of the deaf, while an information war is raging on the ground. Given that backdrop, Luxembourg welcomes the publication yesterday of the first report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, including Crimea, by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The report, based on eyewitness accounts, has provided an objective picture of the situation. I thank Mr. Šimonović for the topical information he has just provided the Council, in addition to the report.
The report and Mr. Šimonović’s briefing paint a very bleak picture of the situation in Crimea. The consequences of the annexation to Russia for people living in Crimea are dire. That is especially true for minorities, such as the Crimean Tatars, who have had to leave the peninsula out of fear of violent repression, and for Ukrainians themselves, who have are subjected to flagrant discrimination if they refuse to adopt Russian citizenship.
The report confirms that the referendum held on 16 March in Crimea, in violation of the Constitutions of both Ukraine and Crimea, was held in conditions devoid of any legitimacy. Crimea was occupied and cut off from the rest of Ukraine, journalists and members of civil society were intimidated, and freedom of the media was severely hampered. Cases of torture, forced disappearance and murder must be the subject of independent judicial investigation. Urgent measures are needed to restore the rule of law and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms. I join my colleagues who have stressed the importance of providing United Nations representatives with access to the entire territory of Ukraine, including Crimea. This applies in particular to the members of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission.
With the report of the High Commissioner, we now have confirmation of what Mr. Šimonović told the Council on 19 March (see S/PV.7144) — there have been no systematic or widespread attacks against “the ethnic Russian community” in Ukraine. Yet the unfounded rumors of threats of such attacks continue to be exploited to foment unrest in eastern and south-eastern Ukraine. Russian media are systematically used to create a climate of fear and rouse local populations against the Ukrainian Government. Luxembourg therefore endorses the appeal launched yesterday by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Representative on Freedom of the Media, Ms. Dunja Mijatović, on measures to be taken to counter propaganda and misinformation. The current situation is explosive. It would be irresponsible to further fan the flames.
Luxembourg condemns the actions carried out since 6 April by armed groups in several cities in eastern and south-eastern Ukraine, especially in the Donetsk region. Those actions lack all spontaneity. They are coordinated and well-orchestrated, akin to what happened in Crimea. We are particularly concerned by the targeted deployment of pro-Russia individuals in the local demonstrations, as noted in the High Commissioner’s report. We are not challenging the right to demonstrate freely, but the deployment of pro-Russia elements has led to violent incidents and the forceful occupation of Government buildings and local law-enforcement institutions. We call on Russia to publicly distance itself from the actions of the separatist militias.
We pay tribute to the outstanding composure and restraint shown by the Ukrainian authorities in the face of these destabilizing actions. We understand that they cannot fail to act in the situation. We encourage the Ukrainian Government to proceed in a measured and proportional manner, with full respect for human rights.
Luxembourg still believes that a peaceful solution to the crisis can be found. Such a solution would require direct dialogue between Russia and Ukraine. We hope that the four-party talks that will bring together chief negotiators from Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union in Geneva tomorrow will allow for a dialogue to be initiated and a way out of the most dangerous crisis that Europe has faced since the end of the Cold War to be found.
Pending a political solution, the presence throughout Ukraine of impartial United Nations and OSCE observers is crucial to establishing the facts and countering warmongering rhetoric. We encourage the human rights observer mission to redouble its efforts in that respect. As the Secretary General of the OSCE stated in Brussels today, to observe in a neutral manner and report on the facts is to help establish the conditions for a de-escalation of this dangerous situation. ","I thank Assistant Secretary-General Ivan Šimonović for his briefing.
We take this opportunity to reiterate our full support for the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine. We are confident that such independent and credible international mechanisms can contribute to the de-escalation of tensions on the ground. We hope that the United Nations monitoring mission, in close cooperation with the special monitoring mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, will continue to play a constructive role in that process.
The recent report of the United Nations monitoring mission raises a number of human rights concerns in Ukraine. There have been credible allegations of harassment, arbitrary arrests and torture, targeting journalists and activists. In Crimea, the referendum was marred by a significant increase in propaganda and incitement to hatred and violence. We are especially concerned that such distorted narratives and restriction of media freedom are also being exploited in eastern Ukraine to further exacerbate the tense and vulnerable situation.
We are closely monitoring unfolding events in eastern Ukraine and are alarmed by the violent seizure of key public buildings by armed individuals. Such instances point to a serious deterioration in the situation. We condemn any use of force in seeking a change is status. Any further incitement to hostility and provocative actions aimed at destabilizing Ukraine must stop.
With the important election scheduled in May, we call on the Ukrainian Government to lead an inclusive political process that reflects the region’s diversity and ensures the protection of all ethnic and linguistic minorities. That is esential for any sustainable solution to the crisis.
Before concluding, we stress that a solution to the crisis can be found only by exploring all diplomatic efforts, especially bilateral dialogue between Russia and Ukraine. In that regard, we welcome the forthcoming Geneva meeting among Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union and encourage all concerned parties to continue such efforts to seek a peaceful political solution.
We once again reaffirm our full supprt for Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of its internationally recognized borders. Ukraine’s future must be steered solely by the will and aspirations of Ukrainians themselves without intervention or influence by outside forces. "
S/PV.7154,13/04/2014,Situation in Crimea and deterioration of political situation in South-Eastern Ukraine,"I would like to thank Assistant Secretary-General Fernandez-Taranco for his briefing. China is deeply worried about the recent escalation of the situation in Ukraine. We hope that the relevant parties will remain calm, exercise restraint and avoid any further deterioration of the situation. Settling the question of Ukraine involves the interests and concerns of all parties. It should be considered in a balanced manner. Political and diplomatic channels should continue to be pursued in order to narrow differences and settle the issue within the framework of law and order. China has consistently called on the international community to make constructive efforts and employ good offices to ease the situation in Ukraine, and will continue to support the international community in those endeavours.","Since yesterday, we have seen the abrupt and simultaneous outbreak of violence in eastern Ukraine: nothing about it was spontaneous. France condemns the violence. We call on all parties to exercise restraint and dialogue so that a peaceful solution to the crisis quickly emerges. Everyone must work towards de-escalation. The scenario we are seeing reminds one of the events that took place in Crimea one month ago: simultaneous action by a small but trained group of aggressive activists determined to occupy territory, followed by the presence of disciplined, masked men wearing uniforms and armed with weapons of war that are not found in military surplus. Those facts, which come to us through the waves of images on the Internet, are the same as the ones that Russia labelled a month ago as spontaneous demonstrations by local self-defence groups. No one believed it then, and we do not believe it today. One gets the impression that, in denying the facts, Russia is unaware of the existence of the Internet and that it serves to contradict its denials. Let us not forget that such protests were a prelude to the annexation of Crimea. Moreover, the build-up of Russian troops for several weeks now — under the guise of military exercises — casts an ominous shadow over eastern Ukraine. Further still, the economic pressure is becoming more biting. Without dialogue with the Ukrainian side, which it has taken by the throat, Russia has brutally raised the price of gas. It blocks the entry of goods at the border between Russia and Ukraine, no doubt in an effort to stifle a country it calls its brother. Finally, Russia is systematically bombarding Ukraine with a message of defiance vis-à-vis Kyiv via the airwaves and television channels, which, for many people who do not have access to various sources of information, is the only message they hear. It is against that backdrop that France commends the level-headedness of Ukrainian officials who, against that destabilizing torrent of events, seek to resolve the crisis through dialogue. That is the spirit in which Prime Minister Yatsenyuk visited eastern Ukraine with specific proposals in response to the real questions of people overwhelmed by propaganda who are disoriented and being exploited by radical groups. France has always been clear on the issue of the status of languages and regions. We encourage the authorities in Kyiv to continue their efforts for cooler heads to prevail, enter into a constructive dialogue and reassure people about their place in Ukraine. The future of Ukraine should not, and cannot, be up to anyone else but the Ukrainians themselves. We should support the Ukrainian authorities in organizing elections, under the best of conditions, that ensure that everyone is represented. Our message has always been clear that the presidential election scheduled for 25 May must be free and transparent and guaranteed by the presence of international observers. We reiterate our commitment to the territorial integrity of Ukraine. We call on Russia commit to de-escalation and to condemn, along with the rest of the Council, the attempts at destabilization carried out by armed groups in eastern Ukraine. We also call on Russia to fully assume its role as a permanent member of the Security Council. Russia is a guarantor of peace and security in the world, both in the larger world and in its immediate neighbourhood. There cannot be two different standards. Russia must today put its full weight behind helping Ukraine regain stability. It must show itself up to the task of playing the role it wishes to play as a pillar of Euro-Asian stability. We hope that the proposed meeting on 17 April among Russia, Ukraine, the United States and the European Union will be held and that it makes it possible for solutions to emerge. This is a crucial stage and we call on all parties to exercise calm and restraint. In conclusion, I would like to raise a final warning call. The danger that now faces us is the failure of all our concerted efforts to build an international order that is not based on force, for today it is force alone that is seeking to impose the law.","The Russian Federation has called for this emergency meeting of the Security Council because of the serious dangerous evolution of the situation in south-eastern Ukraine. We have pointed out on several occasions, including in this Chamber, that the reckless actions that led to the coup d’état by the self-proclaimed Kyiv authorities threaten to definitively destroy the fragile mosaic of Ukrainian society. The authorities do not wish to listen to those who do not accept the imposed dominance of Kyiv by national radicals and chauvinistic, Russophobic and anti-Semitic forces, whom they perceive as a threat to their human dignity and to their very lives. Grotesque Russophobia and entrenched hatred have become the norm in the Verkhovna Rada as well. A few days ago, a member of Parliament belonging to the chauvinist Svoboda party said this about the Russian-speaking inhabitants of Ukraine: “I would have acted much more harshly. I would simply have shot them. The enemy is prevailing in our land. They should have been chased out in 1654. These creatures deserve only one thing — death. ”It should be noted that this was said by a woman. We can only imagine the thoughts that must be churning in the minds of her brutal fellow partisans. And that is not even the most radical group on the Ukrainian political spectrum. Should we be surprised that the peaceful political protects and the call by the people of south-eastern Ukraine for their aspirations to be heard have been met by the Rada with draconic laws entailing long-term prison sentences for separatism? The events of the past two days have shown that, following our many calls for the organization of inclusive national political dialogue, a measure of common sense has prevailed in Kyiv. Prime Minister Yatsenyuk went to Donetsk; although he did not meet with the protesters, he did say the right things about dialogue, decentralization and his desire to find a way out of the problem. What is the situation today? We have been told that restraint will be exercised and a peaceful solution found to the situation that takes into account the opinions of the various groupings of the Ukrainian population. That has been confirmed by our Western interlocutors. However, on 13 April the Verkhovna Rada-appointed President Turchynov stated that the Ukrainian Security Council had decided to launch a full-scale anti-terrorist operation, including the use of the armed forces. However, unlike the Maidan demonstrators, the protesters have terrorized no one, have used no bulldozers against the authorities, and thrown no Molotov cocktails. It is no coincidence that law-enforcement officers were present among the Maidan protestors. Now the Kyiv authorities must use force to suppress other areas of the country. According to Turchynov, the people of south-eastern Ukraine must end their protests by the morning of Monday, 14 April, lest armed force be used. However, the protesters’ interests and opinions have not been taken into account or even discussed. As a result, blood has already been shed in the South-East and the situation is extremely dangerous. Any further escalation of the situation must be swiftly stopped. The international community must require the Maidan henchmen who seized power in Kyiv to cease their war against their own people and to implement all the commitments under the 21 February agreement. The Western sponsors of the Maidan henchmen, in particular those who stood as witnesses to the agreement and the United States, which is their backer, are obligated to end their support, dissociate themselves from neo-Nazis and other extremists, stop the use of force against the Ukrainian people, and begin forthwith a genuine national dialogue with the full participation of all regions, in the interests of the speedy implementation of radical constitutional reform. It is the West that must determine the opportunity for avoiding civil war in Ukraine. Some people, including in this Chamber, do not wish to recognize the real reasons for the events in Ukraine and are forever seeing the hand of Moscow in the South-East. Enough is enough. They must stop claiming that we have deployed our army along the border with that country and are practically already at the English Channel, and that we have sent agents to coordinate the protests in Ukraine. It must be understood that south-eastern Ukraine and its people are deeply worried about their future and that they do not want anyone, especially the nationalist radicals, to impose their will on them. Many words have been spoken and many pronouncements made here today. But the first impression I would like to share with my colleagues is that they have not been looking at the clock. It is now 9.30 p.m. our time, which means that in Ukraine it is about 3.30 a.m. That means that in a couple of hours it will be Monday morning, 14 April. That is the date when it has been agreed that Mr. Turchynov’s criminal decree sending Ukraine’s military forces to suppress the protests will take effect. We have heard many unfair pronouncements about Russia today, but of course the most unfair of all came from our Ukrainian colleague, who accused Russia of terrorism. Why did he not accuse those who terrorized his Government for months on end, up to 21 February, of terrorism? They were people who really did terrorize the forces of law and order, who really did attack police and shoot at them and at those protesting against the authorities and seemed to be attacking their country. Why were they not called terrorists? Indeed, they have been exempted from any responsibility for the criminal activities they conducted for several months. I reiterate that, unfortunately, several clumsy accusations have been made against Russia. It has been said that Russia somehow wishes to destabilize Ukraine, if not practically crush it altogether. But why was there no response to our call at the start of the crisis for launching a dialogue on how to help Ukraine emerge from the political and economic crisis it had found itself in? Why was the crisis encouraged to continue? Why was it only just a few days ago that the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany and Poland said that the European Union and Russia should indeed talk about the economic prospects for Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova in connection with their joining the partnership programme of the European Union. And by the way, we have heard nothing about the fact that those ministerial conversations took place in Brussels. Let us see what the response will be to the reproaches to Russia over the fact that we do not want supply Ukraine with gas for free. Let us see on 14 April what response the European ministers will give to the letter that President Putin wrote proposing that we work together to help Ukraine emerge from its economic turmoil. It is true that the people in Washington, D.C., to whom we did not send the letter, have already poisoned it for the European Union, calling it economic blackmail. But let us see whether the European Union has retained some kind of sovereignty and whether it is capable of making independent, rational decisions that can help to rescue the situation from crisis. During the entire course of the crisis in Ukraine, Russia has never advocated aggravating it or destabilizing the country. We have absolutely no interest in doing such a thing, since for us Ukraine is too important as an economic and political partner and a country that is very close to us in many ways. We do not desire its destabilization. We are not to blame for what has produced the results that we are now witnessing. Mr. Fernandez-Taranco said that it was on 6 April that the actions were first observed whereby residents of south-eastern areas of Ukraine were seizing certain administrative buildings. And in this, of course, they learned from the experience of the Maidan in Kyiv, where for weeks and months administrative buildings were occupied, and which for some reason our Western partners saw as demonstrations of democracy. But when it came to the south-eastern regions of Ukraine, somehow such tactics were unacceptable. A month and a half elapsed between 21 February and 6 April; a month and a half had gone by since the overthrow of President Yanukovych and the conclusion of the agreement that could have prevented an escalation of the situation. From the very beginning, all we said was that it was essential to conclude that agreement; that perhaps a constitutional assembly should be convoked; and that some decisive gesture should be made towards the south-eastern regions of Ukraine. Was any such gesture made? Finally, Mr. Yatsenyuk came, said something and left. Then Mr. Turchynov came the next day and did not seem to agree with him. It seemed they preferred to use force. Incidentally, some very worrying tones have crept into our numerous contacts with our Western colleagues. As the Council knows, our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Sergei Lavrov, has been talking to Secretary of State Kerry on the phone almost every day. Kerry continually claims to understand our concern that in contacts with the Ukrainian authorities genuine efforts should be made to ensure that they demonstrate a better grasp of the concerns of the south-eastern regions of Ukraine regarding a definition of their autonomy, independence and language rights. And then suddenly one of the United States Deputy Secretaries of State gets up in Congress and says, we know that these talks will not lead anywhere, but we have to occupy the time somehow. “Occupy the time.” So, really, maybe somebody in Washington, D.C., is thinking about Turchynov’s military offensive scenario. In which case, there is no need to accuse Russia of attempting destabilization. The representative of the United States noted that Vice-President Biden will be going to Ukraine, it seems, on 21 April. But maybe he should not wait for 21 April. Maybe he should go right now. Pick up the phone, call Mr. Turchynov — as he called President Yanukovych more than once before 21 February — and say to him what he said to Mr. Yanukovych. As we were informed by the Vice-President’s Chief of Staff, he said, “For God’s sake, just do not use force. Call off your forces from the centre of Kyiv”. That was what Mr. Biden said. And now, is the United States going to encourage the fulfilment of this criminal decree authorizing the use of military force? Why, in one case, when it was a question of preparations to storm the residence of the President of Ukraine, the call was that under no circumstances should force be used, while in the current situation, it is to encourage the insane military actions that Turchynov’s decree talks about? I would therefore request Ms. Power to ask Vice-President Biden to call Mr. Turchynov right now, because in a few hours’ time things might take an irreversible turn. Many colleagues mentioned the meeting that was announced for 17 April. Indeed, for some months now, in particular during the period after 21 February, we have constantly encouraged such formats for dialogue as a possible way to achieve a solution to the crisis. We agreed in principle that the meeting would take place among the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Secretary of State Kerry, Ms. Ashton and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. We very much hope that such a high-level meeting will encourage a broad political dialogue in Ukraine and show the way towards a political solution to the crisis. But what does the Council think? If armed force is used and hostilities take place tomorrow, are we really going to sign off on that meeting? Of course, that initiative is going to be fundamentally undermined if military operations are commenced in south-eastern Ukraine. Please, let us refrain from any accusations or speculation as to why Russia is trying to do what it is doing. Let us focus our attention on what we can actually do in this case. Here I am speaking to my Western colleagues. Let us ensure that we do not permit the Ukrainian authorities to commit the reckless actions that are currently enshrined in the criminal decree by Mr. Turchynov, and let us stop that decree from being implemented. That would have extremely significant consequences, first and foremost for the people of Ukraine, of course. That needs to be avoided. I shall not take up much of the Council’s time. I should just like to say two things. First, the representative of Ukraine is far too easy in characterizing his own people as bandits. The Right Sector and those who say the demonstrators should be killed are not bandits; they are simply the political elite of Kyiv. Are not those who are protesting in eastern Ukraine able to do so without Russia’s say-so? Do they need Russia to say that events in Kyiv are unacceptable before they are able to grasp that? When radicals come to tell the miners of that region that they will establish their own order — surely the miners can understand that without a hint from Russia? Are the protesters able to understand how bad things have become only when Russian agents come to explain the situation to them? Do their own life experience and understanding of the situation in their own country count for nothing? How will those things influence them? Secondly, with regard to the statement made by my American colleague Ms. Power, she did not mention her view on the decree to use armed force in eastern Ukraine. I hope that, as the Ukrainian representative has called for, following today’s discussion some Western colleagues and partners will pick up the telephone and call their leaders and those in Kyiv with whom they enjoy influence, who may not act unless they get the green light from Western capitals. I would ask my colleagues to give them the red light and tell them that problems can be resolved through dialogue and not military confrontation.","The United Kingdom is gravely concerned by events in eastern Ukraine, which have escalated over the past 48 hours, with armed men seizing control of Government buildings and erecting checkpoints and barricades in six different cities. Street protests have given way to violent action. That is a dangerous escalation of an already dangerous situation. We have all seen the video footage of events over the weekend: professional, well-armed and well-equipped units wearing identical uniforms conducting coordinated military operations against Ukrainian State institutions. That is a pattern that is all too familiar. Coming just weeks after Russian troops illegally deployed to Crimea while wearing uniforms without insignia, these events point clearly to Russia once again interfering directly in the internal affairs of Ukraine while using manufactured pretexts and military force. Such actions are contrary to international law, have already been condemned by the international community and have been declared invalid by the General Assembly. As a Member of the United Nations, and as a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia is obliged to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of any State. Yet satellite images show that there are between 35,000 and 40,000 Russian troops in the vicinity of the border with Ukraine, equipped with combat aircraft, tanks, artillery and logistical support units. That is in addition to the 25,000 Russian troops based illegally in Crimea. Just as six weeks ago Russia denied deploying its troops to Crimea, it also now denies that it has amassed troops on Ukraine’s eastern border. It claims that the publicly available satellite images illustrating that troop deployment were taken in August 2013. That is false; additional images released on 11 April show clearly that the build-up started in early March of this year. Russia’s aggressive stance is a clear threat to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine. The United Kingdom calls on Russia immediately to redeploy its troops away from the border, cease all activity designed to heighten tensions and sow discord, and revoke the mandate given by the Federation Council on 1 March to use military force on Ukrainian soil. The Russian Federation has made little secret of its efforts to undermine the process of reconciliation in Ukraine. Rather than assisting its neighbours in rebuilding their country after the fall of a deeply corrupt regime that left the nation on the verge of bankruptcy, Russia has instead sought to destabilize the country further in pursuit of its narrow interests. Russia must desist from those steps and address whatever grievances it has through dialogue, starting with the contact group talks scheduled for this coming week. The international community is not fooled by the Kremlin’s use of propaganda and misinformation to spread fears among the population of eastern Ukraine. Contrary to Russian claims, the recent demonstrations in eastern cities are not organic. They do not enjoy widespread support, and the numbers of genuine protestors on the streets pale in comparison to the crowds of hundreds of thousands who protested against the former regime. Rather, what we are witnessing is a well-orchestrated campaign designed to destabilize the country. If Russia really has genuine concerns about Ukraine’s Russian-speaking population, then its actions have done nothing to safeguard their interests. The illegal annexation of Crimea, stoking tensions and provoking violence in eastern Ukraine, hurt and endanger all the people of Ukraine. The special monitoring mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the United Nations human rights monitoring mission are in Ukraine to observe the situation and report on developments. Their presence is designed to safeguard the rights of all the citizens of Ukraine. We look forward to their assessment of the situation and we fully support their work. Russia is seeking to impose its will on the people of Ukraine by using misinformation, intimidation and aggression — tactics drawn from the darkest days of the past century. That is completely unacceptable. The Ukrainian people have the right to determine their own future free from Russian interference. On 25 May Ukraine will elect a new president. The Ukrainian Government has stated clearly that its programme of constitutional reform will include discussions on the degree of autonomy devolved to Ukraine’s regions. That is a clear pathway to resolve differences through peaceful, constitutional means. The use of armed force that we are now witnessing in eastern Ukraine to impose one set of views on the peaceful majority is therefore entirely without justification. Moscow must reject these latest unlawful actions, and do so publicly.","The human stakes of what is happening in Ukraine are extremely high. The lives of innocent civilians are at risk, yet we are being bombarded by Russian disinformation and propaganda, while the Ukrainians are being confronted by incitement and violence. Russian media and Government spokespersons are spreading fiction, so we must tonight focus on facts. The Council has heard, these last weeks, Russia disclaim any intention of occupying or invading. The Council has heard it publicly, and we have heard it privately. Unfortunately, the fact is that the armed seizure of buildings in six eastern Ukrainian towns yesterday, and several more today, mirrors the tactics Russian forces used in the early stages of the Crimea invasion. Then, too, officials from the Russian Federation spoke early on in the crisis and disclaimed any intention of occupying or invading. In the earlier Crimean case, highly organized, well-equipped and professional forces wearing Russian military uniforms and military gear without identifying insignia moved in first to take control of Crimean Government and security facilities, before being later replaced by regular Russian military forces. Then, too, Russia said it was acting to protect minorities’ rights. But the whole world now knows that they were not. As the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has reported, the minorities at risk in Crimea are Tatars and Ukrainians. The Council has heard that there are no Russian troops in eastern Ukraine, but the fact is that many of the armed units that we have seen were outfitted in bullet-proof vests and camouflage uniforms with insignia removed. Those armed units, some wearing black and orange Saint George’s ribbons — associated with Russian Victory Day celebrations — raised Russian and separatist flags over seized buildings and have called for referendums and union with Russia. We know who is behind that; indeed, the only entity in the area capable of those coordinated, professional military actions is Russia. The synchronized surgical seizure of buildings yesterday occurred in towns along the main highway, followed by armed roadblocks, almost as if a coordinated barrier were being formed between Kyiv and the major eastern cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. The Council does not have to take my word for it — or even that of the Ukrainian Government — it need only witness for itself the videos of professional military shepherding thugs into a building in Kramatorsk; the photographs showing the so-called concerned citizens taking over Sloviansk, equipped exactly like the elite troops that took Crimea; or the video of a military operation in Krasny Liman by armed men with the same equipment. The Council has heard laments about instability, as if instability were organic. But the fact is that this is the saddest kind of instability: it is completely man-made. This instability was written and choreographed in and by Russia. We continue efforts to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine and find a diplomatic path forward, which is why Secretary Kerry will participate in the Geneva talks on 17 April, which will include Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov. But if those are to be successful, Russia will have to explain why its forces continue to mass on the Ukrainian border — at least 40,000 forces — and it will have to come with constructive ideas on how to de-escalate and resolve the armed attacks on buildings in eastern Ukraine. The United States stands with Ukraine and the fundamental principle that the future of Ukraine must be decided by the Ukrainian people. We also stand with international law and norms and the fundamental principle that borders are not suggestions. On Monday, we will conclude the $1 billion loan guarantee for Ukraine. That will benefit all the Ukrainian people, including minorities. Next week, Vice-President Biden will visit Ukraine. We strongly support concluding the agreement between Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund so that the international community can bolster Ukraine’s economy. And we will support in every way we can Ukraine’s elections at the end of May so that Ukraine can advance its political transition and look to a peaceful future. I will be brief, but in response to my colleague from the Russian Federation, I would like to say just a few things. First, the United States has constantly called for de-escalation and urged restraint. That has been our consistent policy. Our consistent statements have made clear that military force is not the answer, and we have commended the Ukrainians, frankly, for enduring more than probably any country in the United Nations could or would endure without using force. Therefore, there have been no shortage of efforts at diplomacy. Secondly, it is not the United States that has escalated the situation, it is the Russian Federation. Thirdly, while we would like to place our faith in talks with the Russian Federation, the European Union and Ukraine, it is hard to reconcile the behaviour of the Russian Federation, the propaganda of the Russian Federation and the military actions of the Russian Federation — which range from the massing of 40,000 troops on the border to the subversive activities inside Ukraine — with their appeal for diplomacy and de-escalation. It is an appeal that we wish were in fact sincere. Fourthly, a few times, the representative of the Russian Federation has described what is happening in the eastern cities as protests and demonstrations. I would refer back to my French colleague’s comment that those claims are rooted in some idea that the Internet does not exist and that people cannot see for themselves that they are not protests and they are not demonstrations. They are professional forces carrying weapons — Russian-made weapons, as it happens — and carrying out sophisticated, coordinated military operations across a substantial number of eastern Ukrainian cities. They are not demonstrations. They are not protests. They are military operations. Finally, the credibility of the Russian Federation has been gravely undermined. That said, we remain eager and willing to talk about how to de-escalate the situation. That will require that the Russian Federation pull back its forces, which are ominously stationed and massed at the eastern Ukrainian border. It will require that the Russian Federation work to de-escalate the situation in the light of the armed takeover of those buildings. If, in fact, the Russian Federation is interested in peace and in upholding its role as an enforcer of international peace and security, then it will engage quickly and with a wholly different degree of conviction, urgency and truthfulness than it has up to this point.",,,,,,,,,,,"I thank you, Madam President, for this opportunity to speak before the Security Council. I thank Council members for understanding the critical situation in Ukraine and for their support.
Before getting into the substance of my statement this evening, I would like start by mentioning that today Christians worldwide celebrate a great holiday, the day of the entry of our Lord into Jerusalem, Palm Sunday. Unfortunately, today the celebration is falling under the shadow of aggression and bloodshed in Ukraine. On the eve of the holiday, terrorists coordinated by agents of the Russian Federation seized control of State buildings in several cities of the Donetsk region.
Let me quote a statement made today by Ukraine’s acting President Oleksandr Turchynov:
“A particularly dangerous situation has arisen in the city of Slavyansk, where professionally trained armed troops wearing Russian armed forces camouflage without insignia shattered the peace. This morning, a convoy of law enforcement officers who sought to protect the citizens of Slavyansk were attacked with assault rifles. The criminals opened intense fire using local people as human shields. The blood of Ukrainians has been shed for one undivided sovereign Ukraine. That blood has been shed in a war that Russia is waging against Ukraine. The aggressor has not stopped, and continues to organize unrest in the eastern regions of our country. It is not a war between Ukrainians. The situation of confrontation was artificially created with the aim of weakening and destroying Ukraine itself.”
Within a short period of time, approximately one and half months, the Ukrainian Government has done everything possible to avoid confrontation through an inclusive approach to each and every region. Recently, Mr. Yatsenyuk, the Prime Minister of Ukraine, visited the southern and eastern regions — Donetsk, Lugansk, Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, Odessa — addressing such issues of concern as the language policy and prospects for decentralization of power and constitutional reforms. The Government is ready to consider the significant empowerment of local authorities in Ukraine. Unfortunately, the efforts of the Government of Ukraine have been severely challenged by recent developments in the eastern regions.
According to Ukrainian intelligence data, during the past month and a half in the eastern regions of Ukraine, agents of the Russian special services embarked on large-scale operations to seize power and destabilize the situation, threatening the lives of citizens of Ukraine, for the purpose of separating those regions from our country. During the past month, our Mission has regularly informed the Security Council and all States Members of the United Nations on the latest developments in Russian actions in Crimea and other regions of Ukraine. Russia has not only been constantly increasing the number of its troops deployed along the Ukrainian border but it has also been sending subversive groups into Ukrainian regions in order to destabilize the situation. Such specially designated groups, made up of 10 to 20 members of the special forces, primarily from the main intelligence directorate or general staff of the armed forces of the Russian Federation, infiltrated Ukrainian territory with the task of forming and organizing military combat units. Ukraine has strong evidence of the involvement of the Russian special service forces, as was mentioned in a statement the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine made public early today.
The detention of Russian citizen members of subversive groups coordinated by the Russian federal security services and military intelligence is carried out on a daily basis by the security services of Ukraine, yielding the following facts, which are just a few out of dozens.
On 8 April, Russian citizen Maria Koleda, who fulfilled intelligence service tasks to destabilize in eastern Ukraine, was detained in Herson.
The Russian saboteur who was about to seize such strategic facilities as the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant was detained in the region of Herson.
On 10 March, a representative of the Russian Federation military intelligence service was detained in Donetsk.
On 12 March, the intelligence group of the Russian armed forces that infiltrated the Herson territory from Crimea was detained at the control point.
On 20 March, a Russian citizen named Markhov, an officer of the main intelligence directorate of the general staff of Russian Federation armed forces, was detained in Chernigiv.
On the same day, a Russian citizen named Oleg Bakhtiar, one of the leaders of the Eurasian Youth Union of Russia, was detained in Kyiv as he was preparing a group of people under the guise of civil activities for the criminal seizure of the Verkhovna Rada and the Cabinet of Ministers.
All of the arrestees confirmed being part of a network of persons conducting Russian subversive activities in Ukraine.
Intercepted radio communications of the aforementioned groups, and others, with their Russian coordinators are available and provide other clear evidence.
It has also been observed that such terrorist groups are heavily armed with weapons used exclusively by Russian armed forces, namely, the Kalashnikov assault rifle AK-100 series. Those weapons have also been seen in the hands of Russian troops in Crimea.
It is clear that the tactics used by terrorists to capture admininstrative buildings in the regions of Donetsk, Lugansk and Kharkiv are identical to those used to seize the buildings of the Crimean Parliament and other Governmental building in Crimea, which video evidence confirms. Terrorist groups are acting in a very organized and pre-planned manner. One of the goals is to equip as many locally recruited marginal people as possible with arms and ammunition. That is why the primary targets of terrorists have been local offices of police and security services with weapon storage facilities. As a result, several hundred guns and automatic rifles have been seized are now in the hands of terrorists.
There is substantial video evidence of armed attacks using gunfire on local Ukrainian police stations, in Slavyansk and Kramatorsk in particular. Those videos, which have been widely broadcast on international television channels and over the Internet, have left absolutely no doubt that the terrorist groups are not the peaceful protesters that our Russian colleagues claim them to be. Rather, they are professional special forces appropriately equipped and armed by the Russian Federation.
Terrorists have started using their weapons against Ukrainian law enforcement and military officers. This morning in Slavyansk the auto convoy of the Ukrainian military was attacked by gunmen using automatic weapons. Terrorists shot and killed Captain Gennady Belichenko of the Ukrainian security services, while “Alfa” Commander Kuznietsov and Colonel Kuksa were seriously wounded, as was a police officer named Selikhov.
In the light of the aforementioned facts, the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, pursuant to our anti-terrorism law of 2003, has adopted a decision to launch a large-scale counter-terrorist operation involving the special units of the Ukrainian armed forces. We are not going to let the Crimea scenario be repeated in eastern Ukraine. We have not imposed a state of emergency as is required by the provisions of the Constitution of Ukraine. Instead, we have prepared a counterinsurgency plan to strike at the armed terrorists.
In his statement today, acting President Oleksandr Turchynov said,
“I would like to emphasize that those not involved in shooting at Ukrainian law enforcement officers and who surrender their weapons and leave seized administrative buildings will not be subject to prosecution.”
Only a few weeks have passed since part of the territory of Ukraine was annexed by the Russian Federation. And now Russia is applying the same tools — inciting separatists by waging unprecedented anti-Ukrainian propaganda in the mass media, distorting the truth about Ukraine, sending in special troops to seize administrative and law-enforcement buildings with the aim of destabilizing the situation in the eastern regions of Ukraine, and encouraging marginal groups to pursue their separatist ambitions, threatening my country’s unity and territorial integrity. Apparently, through these attempts, they hope to disrupt the presidential elections in Ukraine scheduled for 25 May.
Russia often positions itself as a prominent fighter against international terrorism, but by sending its special agents to Ukraine to effect diversions and sabotage, it is actually sponsoring terrorism. Russia’s statements and position are in fact supporting the terrorists in Ukraine who have seized administrative buildings, taken over the military arsenals of the Ukrainian secret services and police in several cities and opened fire on Ukrainian police. Today, official Russian TV channels have widely broadcast interviews with the three individuals — former President Yanukovych, former Prosecutor General Pshonka and former Minister of the Interior Zakharchenko — who are suspected mass murderers in Ukraine. They are wanted internationally. Ukraine has repeatedly asked its Russian partners to extradite those suspects and provide the necessary assistance for their investigation. Unfortunately, the Russian Federation has refused to do that.
Ukraine is being subjected to a large-scale terrorist operation orchestrated by the Russian Federation in subregions of the eastern part of the country. That constitutes a serious threat not only to the security of the people of Ukraine but to international peace and stability as a whole. We consider it to be the Security Council’s duty to find a proper and peaceful solution to this crisis. We once again call on our Russian partners to put an immediate halt to the actions aimed at undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We demand that they leave us in peace.
(spoke in French)
As Ambassador Araud said, this is truly a final cry of warning. Several issues were raised by our Russian colleague. I would like to answer just one.
(spoke in Russian)
First, Mr. Churkin compared the situation in December and January with the current situation. We must recall that, at that time, the people were speaking out against the banditry of the authorities, and now it is bandits who are against the people. There is a difference there.
We cannot remain calm about the fact that several hundred separatists are holding thousands of people hostage to fear in towns. We see the standoffs on television in Kharkiv, Luhansk and Dnipropetrovsk. We cannot look on while small groups of armed people, headed up, inter alia, by agents from the Russian Federation, seize State buildings and take weapons to hand out. Indeed, those are terrorist operations that have been specially organized and orchestrated. Mr. Churkin is absolutely right, there is not much time left at all, there is just about an hour and a half. It is just as easy for him to call his President and say a few simple things to him as it is for me to do so, so I will repeat them here. The statement that Mr. Churkin has referred very negatively to several times today was made by the acting President, Mr. Turchynov, and was addressed to those people who are now creating tension in those towns, the terrorist groups of separatists. He stated:
(spoke in English)“Those not involved in shooting at Ukrainian law enforcement officers and who will surrender their weapons and leave State administrative buildings will be released from prosecution.”(spoke in Russian)
Why do they not call their people and tell them to come back, sit down around the negotiating table and decide together how we can establish good neighbourly relations? That would be the right thing to do. The Government mentioned the referendum, changes to the Constitution, the retention of the language law and the fact that the problems that have cropped up over the decades and remained unsolved by previous Governments needed to be addressed at last. That is something that we need to do, but we are being prevented from doing so. I would like Mr. Churkin to listen to that and convey what he can to his Government.
(spoke in English)
I am sincerely thankful to the members of the Security Council who spoke in favour of a peaceful resolution of the problems in Ukraine. I am sincerely thankful for that. I also thank the members of the Security Council for understanding the critical situation in Ukraine and for any kind of support they can provide. Several issues were raised by our Russian colleague. I would like to answer just one.

Lithuania is deeply concerned about the sharp deterioration of the situation in eastern Ukraine. External forces and local provocateurs continue to fuel separatism and hatred, destabilizing the situation in eastern Ukraine on the eve of the 25 May elections. The scenario is dangerously familiar. Where there was no unrest, unrest and chaos are being created by pro-Russian militias, again anonymous and without insignia, and again carrying modern models of assault weapons as seen in Crimea. Again, considerable Russian troops are massed on Ukraine’s borders. Again, the external anti-Ukranian and anti-Western propaganda machine is in full swing, inciting suspicion, mistrust and hatred waiting to explode. Ukraine’s traitor Yanukovich, who abandoned his country and fled, opening the floodgates to Crimea’s annexation, is being pushed again into the daylight to clear the way for Ukraine’s further dismemberment.
Groups of provocateurs in the hundreds, supported by pro-Russian militias, are attacking buildings of Ukraine’s State institutions and declaring independence from Ukraine, as well as announcing plans for new referendums on joining Russia, in spite of the fact that recent opinion polls clearly show that the predominant majority of people in the region see their future inextricably linked to Ukraine. In fact, about 65 per cent of the region’s residents, according to opinion polls, have expressed their desire to remain part of Ukraine, while only 18.2 per cent want to join Russia.
Tragically, bloodshed is happening where there was no bloodshed before pro-Russian militants started their creeping secessionist provocations. It is as clear as day that, in spite of the reassurances we heard from Moscow a few weeks ago, military aggression against Ukraine and its sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity has not stopped with Crimea. My Government strongly condemns the actions of the separatist groups and their sponsors in the Donetsk region, as well as in the regions of Luhansk and Kharkiv.
Lithuania supports the efforts of the Government of Ukraine to resolve this complex and unpredictable situation in a peaceful way. Ukraine’s Government has reached out repeatedly to the separatists. In the most difficult of political and economic circumstances, Ukraine’s acting President Turchinov has decided to prepare a law on decentralization, granting more powers to the regions. Acting Prime Minister Yatseniuk has clearly stated that the Government must respond to people’s desire to have more regional authority. That decision is an important step forward, showing the flexibility and readiness of legitimate Ukrainian authorities to heed its population and engage constructively.
Prime Minister Yatseniuk also reassured the Russian-speaking population regarding the use of the Russian language. Furthermore, amnesty was offered to all militants who laid down arms and returned to seeking a peaceful solution to existing issues.
It is obvious that the Ukrainian Government is doing everything possible, under such dramatic circumstances, to respond to the legitimate needs and concerns of the population, to curb corruption and impunity, which had reigned under Yanukovich, to re-establish law and order and the authority of the State and to address the problems the Government inherited from years of neglect and mismanagement. We fully support those efforts and once again stress the extraordinary restraint and patience with which Ukraine’s Government has continued to respond to the unending provocations and efforts to dismember the State by armed pro-Russian militants and separatists.
At the same time, when the existence of a State is put in danger, we understand and support the right of Ukraine to defend itself in the face of external aggression and to tackle militant separatism and continuous provocations in order to protect the State and its population from a further escalation of violence.
The international community and members of the Council should not be fooled by the pronouncements of the likes of Yanukovich and his corrupt cronies. The independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine are being threatened, and that threat is a threat to the security and stability of the whole region and Europe, with serious international repercussions.
We urge the Russian Federation to call back its troops from the Ukrainian border, to stop supporting separatist groups and to cease all other actions aimed at destabilizing Ukraine. The meeting among the United States, Russia, Ukraine and the European Union foreseen for 17 April in Geneva wold offer a viable chance for dialogue and diplomacy. We call on Russia not to waste that opportunity. ","I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Nigeria.
I want to join my colleagues in thanking Assistant Secretary-General Oscar Fernandez-Taranco for his briefing on the latest developments in Ukraine. We have observed very closely the unfolding events in Ukraine since our last meeting on 28 March, when the Council was briefed by the Secretary-General. Like others, we are very deeply concerned about the fact that the situation remains tense and, indeed, has deteriorated. The utter lawlessness and state of anarchy witnessed in at least six states in eastern Ukraine are provocative and constitute a grave threat to peace.
Throughout our engagement on this issue, our message has been unequivocal. The need to uphold universally agreed principles and the sanctity of international law is what we have stressed. That begins with respect for the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations, among which is respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States. We have also highlighted the need to use the existing bilateral and multilateral instruments to resolve the crisis. The Budapest Memorandum of 1994 and the Treaty between the Russian Federation and Ukraine on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership, signed by both countries in 1990 and 1997, are significant points of departure for negotiations. Those are the principles that guide Nigeria’s position and that inform our stance on the issue. We believe that only a diplomatic solution, achievable by direct and genuine dialogue between the parties, can resolve the current crisis between the Russian Federation and Ukraine.
Over time, the world has graduated from nineteenth-century adventures. In this splendid twenty-first century, the world should not encourage or tolerate the establishment of power blocs or spheres of influence. which are not only inimical to international peace and security but especially detrimental to the conduct of friendly and balanced relations between and among States. We emphasize the futility and dangers of a military solution to the crisis. Instead, the option of dialogue between the concerned parties must be vigorously pursued without preconditions. We call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint in order to avoid any further deterioration of the situation.
I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.
I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine. ","Jordan is deeply concerned about the recent developments in eastern Ukraine and the accompanying escalation, which could increase the threats to the stability of that region. What is happening there is a mutiny against the State and the Constitution of Ukraine. If it continues it will lead inevitably to the dismemberment and dismantling of the Ukrainian State. Ukraine therefore has a right and a duty to its citizens to preserve its unity and territorial integrity, and, even more important, to restore every part of its territory.
We call on the Ukrainian authorities to attempt to use every possible means to resolve the crisis and keep open the channels for dialogue with the rebels and all the relevant parties in order to put an end to this mutiny. We also appeal to them to respect the principles of human rights in dealing with the crisis. We call on the influential parties to exert every effort to convince the rebels to bring a peaceful end to the crisis, to end their armed demonstrations and acts of intimidation, and to withdraw from Ukrainian public and Government buildings.
The Security Council should also send a clear message of support for Ukraine and its authorities in their efforts to end this movement of armed insurrection, to promote the rule of law and to preserve the country’s unity and territorial integrity. There should be no interference in the internal affairs of Ukraine, no act of intimidation and no threat of use of force against it, which would contravene the principles and positions of the Charter of the United Nations. In that regard, we reaffirm that it is in the interests of the international community as a whole to maintain the integrity of the provisions of international law and to refrain from creating excuses and justifications for military intervention against States, in contravention of the Charter. International law is the cornerstone of equality among States and is designed to protect them from armed threats to their sovereignty regardless of their size, importance or military might. ","We would like to thank Assistant Secretary-General Oscar Fernandez-Taranco for his briefing and welcome the convening of this meeting at this critical time for Ukraine and the region. We face a sensitive development in the crisis in Ukraine. Chile regrets the outbreaks of violence seen in the eastern regions, specifically in Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv, and expresses its deep concern over the serious consequences of the escalation of the crisis owing to the actions of separatist groups.
It is critical that the parties exercise the maximum restraint in order to contain the crisis. Our country once again reiterates the need to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We also reaffirm the obligation incumbent on Members of the United Nations to refrain from resorting to the threat of or use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of any State. It is urgent that all parties involved refrain from undertaking actions that are contrary to the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the international agreements and treaties to which Ukraine is a party.
We once again call on the parties to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis through direct political dialogue, to refrain from taking unilateral measures and to support international mediation initiatives, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 68/262. That process must be inclusive and must ensure the rule of law, human rights, fundamental freedoms and full respect for the rights of minorities. In that context, the role of the Security Council, the Secretary-General, his Special Envoy and regional organizations continues to be fundamental. ","I would like to thank Assistant Secretary-General Oscar Fernandez-Taranco for his briefing.
Chad is deeply concerned by the violent acts committed by armed men and separatist groups in various cities in the east of Ukraine. The actions of those insurgents, who are reportedly well-equipped and well-organized, are aimed at taking possession of public buildings in several cities, further destabilizing Ukraine and compromising the search for a lasting political solution.
Chad condemns every instance of violence that occurred yesterday and today. As we have stated many times in previous meetings of the Security Council on the same matter, the solution to the Ukrainian crisis can only be political, not military. Therefore, the attacks by armed and clearly well-organized men in unmarked uniforms are only making an already explosive situation worse.
Given the dangerous turn that the situation is taking, we call upon all the parties concerned to show restraint and calm. We call on them to give priority to a peaceful solution that respects the sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of Ukraine. In that vein, a political settlement of the crisis necessarily requires that the interests and concerns of all parts of Ukrainian society, in all its diversity, be taken into account. Neither the attempts of the armed insurgents calling for parts of Ukraine to be integrated into Russia nor the recourse to force against those insurgents — much less a possible intervention by foreign forces — will help to solve the Ukrainian crisis.
The age-old historical, geographic and cultural links between Ukraine and the Russian Federation should in principle serve as a basis for new and healthier relations of good neighbourliness, mutual respect and cooperation between them. In that context, we encourage the Secretary-General and the entire international community to pursue their mediation efforts in order to align the positions of the parties involved and find a peaceful solution that respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. ","Like all of us, Australia has watched the events in eastern Ukraine with mounting concern. What we have seen unfold is a coordinated operation where well-trained and well-armed paramilitary units have moved quickly to lay siege to, occupy and control key institutions in five or six towns in Donetsk province. The violence in Sloviansk has led to one death and nine wounded. The stakes are obviously dangerously high. This has not been a spontaneous, grassroots, broad-based protest movement by local inhabitants; rather it is a pattern of highly orchestrated destabilization by pro-Russian groups. Those groups have included units of highly trained armed men with Russian military equipment, operating without identifying insignia. Those units have used force to storm and besiege local Government buildings and institutions.
If all that sounds familiar, it is because we have seen the playbook used by Russia in Crimea. In that case, it became clear that the militias were in fact Russian forces. We condemn any use of proxy forces. A State cannot seek to avoid responsibility for its actions by attempting to cloak the identity of those working on its behalf. The principles of State responsibility make it very clear that a State bears international responsibility for acts undertaken by informal actors whom it engages on its behalf.
We have heard Russia’s statement about the crisis taking place in eastern Ukraine, but what we are actually witnessing is violence and destabilization in an effort to manufacture a sense of crisis and separatism. Ukraine’s response to those provocations has been one of restraint under intolerable threats to its stability and independence. There is no evidence of actions directed at Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine that could possibly justify an intervention by Russia. Nor is there the generalized anarchy claimed. The ongoing work of the special mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is all the more important for providing an objective account of the situation in eastern Ukraine, and we welcome the information that the number of monitors will be significantly increased in coming days. International condemnation of Russia’s actions against Ukraine in the past six weeks has been resounding. General Assembly resolution 68/262 unambiguously condemned the threat and use of force in this manner as contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and to Russia’s specific treaty obligations to Ukraine. Many countries, including my own, have imposed unilateral sanctions to register the depth of their concern. Repeated calls for de-escalation have been ignored.
Russia’s major military build-up along Ukraine’s eastern border has been a significant and deliberation provocation that only further escalates tensions and the likelihood of conflict. It deepens Russia’s own isolation and also, of course, strengthens the resolve of the international community to stand with and support Ukraine as it seeks to maintain its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The only way forward, as we all know, is de-escalation, dialogue and the free elections that are planned for 25 May. And Ukraine must be allowed to prepare for those elections without the interference and coercion we are witnessing.
But talks can take place only with genuine commitment and good faith on all sides. The talks between Russia, Ukraine, the European Union and the United States planned for 17 April are an essential step in that direction, but can take place successfully only on that basis. Attempts to change the facts on the ground are completely contrary to dialogue and peaceful resolution. We call on Russia to work immediately to reduce tensions, stop its destabilization and withdraw its forces from the provocative posture they have assumed on Ukraine’s border. We have heard assurances in the past that Russia will take such action. It now really is imperative that it do so. ",,,,"I thank you, Madam President, for convening this emergency meeting on the situation in Ukraine. I also thank Assistant Secretary-General Oscar Fernandez-Taranco for his briefing on the worrying situation in eastern Ukraine.
We are very alarmed by reports of increased tensions in eastern Ukraine in the past several days. We condemn the attack that killed a State security officer and wounded five others in the eastern city of Slovyansk. The perpetrators of that criminal act should be brought to justice. I take this opportunity to echo the Secretary-General’s call to all sides to work towards calming the situation.
After numerous calls for the de-escalation of the crisis, the situation has become more complex for the diverse Ukrainian community. It is imperative to protect the rights of the citizens of Ukraine regardless of ethnic background. We reiterate our call for an inclusive dialogue, a frank and open discussion that is mutually beneficial for all the parties concerned.
Although Rwanda agrees in principle that Ukraine, like any other country, has a right to self-defence and to promote its territorial integrity, its acts should be proportional. We discourage any military act that would put the lives of innocent civilians in danger.
Rwanda remains of the view that military action will only worsen the already tense situation. We encourage all the parties involved, particularly in the current situation, to exercise full restraint. It is vital to allow the diplomatic efforts that have already been deployed to work. The international community cannot watch another crisis slip out of its hands. We must act on what we stand for — peace and security. We welcome the discussion among the United States, Ukraine and Russia due to take place on 17 April. We encourage United Nations participation in those talks.
In conclusion, let me reiterate that the Security Council, the only world body in charge of maintaining international peace and security, must work towards restoring its own unity in order to be able to defend the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of a States Members of the United Nations, while addressing the interests of the countries of the region. We recognize that there are political interests involved. However, we should not forget that ordinary Ukrainians are caught in the midst of this conflict; all they want and ask for is a peaceful country. This we should all be mindful of. ","I, too, would like to thank Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs Oscar Fernandez-Taranco for his briefing on the developments in Ukraine and on the involvement of the United Nations. I also welcome the presence of the Permanent Representative of Ukraine at this meeting.
Argentina continues to follow the situation with concern, in particular in the east of Ukraine. Undoubtedly, the situation has deteriorated, with further tensions and violence, and we cannot remain indifferent to that. We are deeply concerned that the tension and violence may continue and indeed worsen. We are also concerned about the consequences for Ukraine and the region.
The delegation of Argentina reiterates that it is essential that we adhere to the principles that we subscribe to as Members of the United Nations. In particular, we must remember our commitment to non-interference in the internal affairs of States, whether militarily, politically or economically. In that respect, we believe that the action of any State or international organization must duly respect Ukraine’s handling of its own affairs. As we have expressed on several occasions, the situation will not be resolved through any kind of unilateral action. It is crucial that the use of force be avoided. We join the Secretary-General today in calling on all parties to endeavour to bring calm to the situation. Maximal self-restraint must be shown, and constructive dialogue sought and established on an urgent basis in order to de-escalate the situation and address the parties’ differences.
In conclusion, Argentina will continue to promote dialogue and a peaceful settlement of the crisis. It is essential to step up efforts to create the conditions necessary for urgent dialogue to begin so that solutions can be found to the parties’ differences and the interests of all minorities are taken into account. The multilateral meeting among the United States, the Russian Federation and the European Union that is planned for Thursday, 17 April will present an opportunity to do so. We hope that those main actors will be able to achieve the agreement necessary. We reiterate that the international community should concentrate its efforts on establishing dialogue. We stress that Ukrainians must have a democratic and peaceful outcome to the situation. ","I too would like to thank Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs Oscar Fernandez-Taranco for his briefing on the developments in the situation in Ukraine. I also welcome the Permanent Representative of Ukraine, His Excellency Mr. Yuriy Sergeyev, to the Council.
Luxembourg is deeply concerned about the recent events in eastern and south-eastern Ukraine. Yesterday in Sloviansk, in the Donetsk region, masked and armed men took control of a police station, and then the headquarters of the town’s security services, and put up barricades, blocking access to the town. There are also reports coming from the town of Kramatorsk that armed individuals have taken over a police station and there has been an exchange of fire with the police. Over the weekend, other towns in the Donetsk region saw similiar incidents, which appear to be coordinated and well orchestrated, recalling the events that took place in Crimea.
In that regard, we see a continuation of the actions undertaken by Russia on the territory of Ukraine in recent weeks. Those actions are a flagrant violation of international law, in particular the Charter of the United Nations and the Helsinki Final Act, and run counter to the commitments that Russia has made to Ukraine under the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 and the Treaty between the Russian Federation and Ukraine on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership, signed in 1997.
In that context, we welcome the self-control and restraint shown to date by the Ukrainian authorities in the face of repeated violations of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of their country in the past six weeks. However, we all know that the Ukrainian Government cannot stand there without doing anything in the face of this new threat to its territorial integrity. Like every State Member of the United Nations, Ukraine has the right to defend itself by virtue of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations.
This evening, Russia reiterated its version of events, according to which the demands of the eastern and south-eastern regions of Ukraine are being ignored by Kyiv. However, that does reflect the facts. We commend Ukraine’s consistent affirmation that it is ready for an inclusive political dialogue that takes into account the interests of all Ukrainians and all regions of Ukraine. The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, recently reaffirmed that during his visit to Donetsk on 11 April. However, political dialogue on the country’s future and revising the Constitution cannot take place under the threat of a foreign invasion. That threat must not jeopardize the opportunity for Ukrainians to express their sovereign will, in the presence of international observers, in the free and fair presidential election on 25 May.
We must urgently strive to de-escalate the crisis. We therefore join colleagues in calling for calm and restraint and in renewing the appeal to Russia to withdraw its forces massed near the Ukrainian border. Russia must stop its actions to destabilize eastern Ukraine and distance itself from the separatist militia activity. Continuing the military escalation would have untold consequences.
For its part, Luxembourg would like to believe that it is still possible to settle the Ukrainian crisis peacefully. Multilateral bodies, the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe all have a role to play, in particular through the observers whom they have deployed on the ground. However, a peaceful solution first and foremost requires direct dialogue between Russia and Ukraine. In that regard, we hope that the four-party talks, bringing together the diplomatic leaders of Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union in Geneva on 17 April, will make is possible to begin a dialogue and to find a way out of the gravest crisis that Europe has seen since the end of the Cold War. The tension and violence of recent days must not be used as a pretext to reject all dialogue. The time is critical. There is not a minute to lose in ensuring that dialogue prevails over violence, reason over emotions and peace over war.","I thank Assistant Secretary-General Oscar Fernandez-Taranco for his briefing.
The Republic of Korea is closely watching the recent developments in the eastern part of Ukraine. We are deeply concerned over the escalation of tensions in various cities of eastern Ukraine, including the worrying seizure of key public buildings in Donetsk and Slovyansk by force. Those actions will only further exacerbate the already tense situation, and we condemn any use of force to change the situation on the ground.
As Ukraine moves towards critical elections in May, we believe that political differences must be addressed in a non-violent way through a legitimate process. United Nations States Members should respect that process, and there should not be any influence exerted by outside forces. We reiterate our strong support for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine. "

S/PV.7144,19/03/2014,Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation,"I would like to thank Deputy Secretary-General Eliasson and Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for their respective briefings. China has been closely following developments in the situation in Ukraine. The Security Council has repeatedly taken up the question of Ukraine. China has explicitly stated its principled position on the issues concerned. Respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of States is China’s consistent position. China has taken an fair and impartial approach in addressing the question of Ukraine. We will continue to promote peaceful dialogue and to play a more constructive role in seeking a political solution to the crisis in Ukraine. China has put forward the following proposals in order to address the Ukrainian crisis. An international coordinating mechanism comprising all parties concerned should be established as soon as possible in order to explore political ways to address the situation in Ukraine. In the meantime, all parties should refrain from taking any action that may further exacerbate tensions. International financial institutions should start to explore various possibilities to help Ukraine maintain its economic and financial stability. In our view, a political solution to the Crimean issue should be found within the framework of law and order. All parties concerned should exercise restraint and refrain from any action that could cause the situation to further deteriorate. The international community should make constructive efforts to defuse tension. China supports today’s trip by Secretary- General Ban Ki-Moon to the countries concerned to conduct mediation. China hopes that the international community will continue to make constructive efforts to defuse tension. ","I thank Mr. Eliasson and Mr. Šimonović for their statements, as well as the Permanent Representative of Ukraine for his. This past Saturday, the international community sent a unanimous message to Russia on behalf of the Council, to whit, that the referendum it had instigated in Crimea was illegal and null and void under international law. Russia’s veto changed nothing — quite the contrary. The illegal act of separating Crimea, which had been in preparation since a long time, appeared all the more blatant. Yesterday Crimea was annexed by Russia, despite the picture painted that has fooled no one. The annexation was accompanied by flags, drums and trumpets forming a gathering wave of aggressive nationalism, the future consequences of which, once it is awoken, are unknown; nationalism that never leads to anything good, a nationalism that is used to mask or to justify attempts to suppress civil rights. Moreover, little effort has been made to hide the use of force. The referendum was hastily organized, Russian soldiers were everywhere. Nothing was left to chance. The media was controlled at the level of describing events, international observers were recruited from among the far-right European parties and if fascists are part of the story, they are certainly not where they are claimed to be. Finally, the final results appeared so excessive that they lost all meaning. How could more than 86 per cent of the people have voted, when some communities — particularly the Crimean Tartars and Ukrainians that represent nearly 14 per cent of the population — had called for a boycott. The United Nations was created to ensure that one would no longer witness such spectacles which dishonour the organizers and in effect reflect upon the entire international community. The rule of law must guide relations among States. The acquisition of territory resulting from the use of force or even from simple threats is simply unacceptable. That principle that Russia subscribed to in the early days is our code. I would call it the DNA of the Organization. As I stated on Saturday (see S/PV.7138), by voting against the draft resolution, it is the Charter of the United Nations that Russia has in effect vetoed. We have just heard from Mr. Šimonović that nothing in Ukraine justified references to extremely serious attacks on human rights or minorities placed in critical situations. If any serious human rights violations have occurred, it was during the time of Yanukovych. At least we are reassured regarding the situation throughout the country. The authorities in Kyiv are endeavoring to extend their hand to all of the various components of Ukrainian society. Nothing will justify in the long-term the current discussion about an irresponsible Government whose actions could lead to fear among its populations. In terms of the protection of Russian and Russian language populations in Ukraine invoked by Moscow to justify its intervention in Ukraine — it is again clear that it does not correspond to the reality of the situation, nor is it a legal justification of the military occupation of a territory of a sovereign State and it becomes even less relevant when used as a pretext to extend its own borders. We continue to recall that minorities in Ukraine, including religious and language minorities, must be protected. That falls first and foremost to the transition authorities — and that is what they are doing. The situation in Kyiv, L’viv, Donets’k or Kharkiv should not concern the Council. It is in Sevastopol and Simferopol that the law is being flouted, militiamen terrorize those who will not give in to force, and Ukrainian soldiers are being killed simply because they refuse to surrender. Faced with a Russia that does not heed the concerns of the international community as a whole and has not even responded to the sensible propositions we have made to peacefully resolve the crisis, we are forced to respond. All that remains is to make Russia understand that we will never accept the fait accompli that it has just imposed on the ground. But we must also look to the future, with a double call on Russia. The first is to tell it to stop there. Agents provocateurs are already at work in eastern Ukraine; let them not play the same game as in Crimea; let Russia cease its thinly veiled manoeuvres. It has already succeeded in creating lasting alienation between Ukraine and European countries; to go further wold be most grave. The second call regards the need for Moscow to open a channel of direct negotiations with Kyiv. Russia should make no mistake — Ukraine cannot be replaced with something else, as it seems to hope; no one will decide Ukraine’s future except Ukraine itself. We are already counting the first casualties of this grim misadventure. Yesterday, the Ukrainian Prime Minister announced that the conflict with Russia was now moving from a political phase to a military one. We continue to call on Russia to see reason, listen to the voice of the international community, and not drag the international community into a spiral that will sooner or later spin out of control, or at least escape the restraint of the Ukrainians. I believe that we cannot talk nonsense here and that we cannot let the representative of the Russian Federation lecture us to the effect that Russia has made proposals intended to settle the conflict. In reality, Russia’s proposals are simple. What is mine is mine — that is to say, Crimea — and we can negotiate on what is yours — that is to say, Ukrainian sovereignty. That is the Russian proposal. The Russian keep repeating that they are ready to talk about whatever is left of Ukraine, but Crimea is over. We say no; let us be clear. On such bases, we cannot have a dialogue founded on international legal order. We did not reject the Russian proposal. Quite simply, we rejected any proposal that boils down to forcing us to accept the annexation of Crimea. It is simple. We are ready to negotiate on the basis of international law. International law means the territorial integrity of Ukraine.","Yesterday, a truly historic event took place — the reunification of Russia and Crimea, which our peoples have awaited for six decades. In strict compliance with international law and democratic procedure, without outside interference and through a free referendum, the people of Crimea have fulfilled what is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and a great number of fundamental international legal documents — their right to self-determination. They turned to Russia with a request to welcome Crimea into the Russian Federation. Russia as a sovereign State agreed to the Crimean people’s request. A treaty to that end has been signed between the Russian Federation and the Crimean Republic on the accession into the Russian Federation of the Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol and the creation within the Russian Federation of two new territorial units. The results of the referendum were quite clear. More than 82 per cent of voters participated in the voting, more than 96 per cent of whom chose in favour of reunification with Russia. This figure is the expression of the free will of the people of Crimea. I shall now briefly depart from my text. I was stunned by how the Permanent Representative of Ukraine tried to discredit the referendum by using the arguments of Western propaganda — that those who did not want to vote were visited at home with the police in tow. A few of my Western colleagues may not know this, but my Ukrainian colleagues know very well that this is an old, tried and tested tradition in our elections. If someone cannot vote because they are too ill to come to the polling booth, members of the electoral commission will visit that person at home to afford him or her an opportunity to vote. But I am going to stick to the topic. I will not dwell on the history of the issue in detail. The President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, spelt it out yesterday in a televised appearance with which I trust all present here are familiar. I shall focus on just a few aspects. Today, out of the 2.2 million inhabitants of the Crimean peninsula, close to 1.5 million are Russian; 350,000 are Ukrainians, most of whom consider Russian to be their mother tongue; and between 290,000 and 300,0000 are Crimean Tatars, a significant proportion of whom, as shown by the referendum, also favour Russia, regardless of what others elsewhere might have suggested in the run-up to the referendum. A historic injustice has been righted. It resulted from the arbitrary actions of the leader of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics at the time, Nikita Khrushchev, who, with the stroke of a pen in 1954, in violation of constitutional norms, transferred the Russian region of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which was then part of the same State. He did so without informing the population of Crimea and without their consent. No one has showed any regard for the views of the Crimeans during the break-up of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Over the years, many citizens and community activists in Crimea have repeatedly raised this issue, stating that Crimea is intrinsically Russian land and that Sevastopol is a Russian city. It is only now that the will and freely expressed choice of the Crimean has been fulfiled. Of course, we have taken note of the reaction of a number of our Western partners who simply cannot rid themselves of the imperial colonial habits of attempting to impose their writ on other peoples and countries. Now they are nervous as their reckless geopolitical gamble in Ukraine has led to such unexpected results. The people of Crimea have spoken and made their choice, as have the people of Russia, and those choices must be accepted and respected by all. Let me now turn to the alarming situation in Ukraine and the international assistance provided to it to overcome its pronounced internal crisis. The pseudo-friends of Ukraine need to understand once and for all that the cause of the crisis there lies not with Russia but in the irresponsible actions of individual Ukrainian political forces and their foreign mentors. The attempt to drive Ukraine, like other targeted States of the eastern partnership, to make an artificial choice between the European Union and Russia, largely provoked the deep-seated internal political crisis that led to the unconstitutional changes in Kyiv. However, Western capitals, it would seem, continue to feel no shame about backing people who are not ready to listen or heed the views of the entire Ukrainian people and who are fully dominated by the ultra-radical, nationalist organizations Right Sector and the Freedom Party, which according to the European Parliament, is anti-Russian, anti-Semitic and xenophobic. And yet, it is with them that the European Union is planning to sign the political section of an association agreement in the near future. In that respect, we are puzzled by Mr. Šimonović’s glib, one-sided assessment of the human rights situation in Ukraine. We are especially puzzled by the fact that Mr. Šimonović referred to the Maidan snipers. Not a word was said about the evidence that provocateurs fired both on the representatives of law and order and on the opposition forces to pave the way for the use of force to seize power. One simply cannot claim that there has been no politically motivated killing or mass torture; no kidnapping of individuals, no attacks on journalists and human rights defenders; no political detentions. One cannot claim that nationalist radicals, like the Taliban in Afghanistan, are not destroying and profaning historical sites, that there are no chilling racist incidents with anti-Russian and anti-Semitic undercurrents, backed or at least passed over in silence by those who have seized power in Kyiv. The Kyiv extremists have offered rewards for killing journalists, the self-proclaimed authorities have shut down foreign television stations, foreign correspondents have been denied all access, and they are even trying to scramble the retransmission of satellite signals. Two scandalous incidents occurred only yesterday. Two dozen members of Parliament and activists of the Freedom Party pushed their way into the Cabinet, and in front of cameras beat up and took away the General Director of the Ukrainian First National television station, who knows where. Who is in authority in Kyiv? Neo-Nazi slogans are heard, Nazi enforcers and their Bandera-loving storm-troopers are glorified, and calls are sent out for violence against Russian-speaking Ukrainians and Russians in general, with all the signs of ethnic cleansing, and for the armed overthrow of the legal authorities. These must all be clear and obvious to anyone claiming to be objective. Instead, supposedly profound concerns are raised about the human rights situation in Crimea. As a result of the combined efforts of the people and the self-defence forces, law and order has been maintained, and Crimean authorities have guaranteed the rights of all minorities, without exception. In that respect, we would especially like to draw attention to the fact that, pursuant to the treaty between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Crimea regarding succession to the Federation, there will be three equal State languages in the Republic: Ukrainian, Russian and Crimean Tartar. Crimeans, with the support of the entire Russian people, are doing all in their power to preserve peace and tranquility in Crimea. No provocation will keep them from doing so, not even such incidents as that which occurred a few days ago in Simferopol, where, in Maidan style, sniper fire from an unfinished building across from the Ukrainian military base killed an unarmed self-defence soldier and a Ukrainian national soldier. The attack by Russian forces on a Ukrainian military facility, to which the Permanent Representative referred today, simply did not take place. It was clearly a planned provocation that was immediately seized on by Mr. Yatsenyuk and Mr. Turchynov to call on the Ukrainian military forces in Ukraine to use their weapons — against whom? Against their fellow countrymen? Russia stands ready to work in close cooperation with all international partners that are genuinely interested in normalizing the situation in Ukraine on the basis of a broad internal Ukrainian dialogue with the participation of all responsible political forces and all regions. Establishing a multilateral mechanism for the settlement of the Ukrainian crisis could be promoted with out partners through our proposal to create an assistance group for Ukraine. We await responses to our constructive initiative. We will continue to discuss proposals aimed at fulfilling the agreement of 21 February with the objective of restoring order, launching comprehensive constitutional reform in Ukraine, and putting an end to the provocations of the ultra-nationalist and radical forces against the Russian-speaking population and our fellow countrymen in south-eastern and other parts of Ukraine. To that end, observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe are invited as long as they implement an impartial mandate and mutually agreed modalities for such a deployment in various regions of Ukraine. During the course of our discussions, a number of my colleagues have given themselves poetic license. I am especially forced to return to the statement made by the representative of the United States. Ms. Powers started with a reference to Tolstoy and Chekhov and finished by lowering herself to the level of the tabloid press. It is simply unacceptable to listen to such insults addressed to our country. If the delegation of the United States of America expects our cooperation in the Security Council on other issues, Ms. Powers must understand that quite clearly. I do not want to exchange polemics with my Ukrainian colleagues and I do not think there is going to be a lengthy discussion, but there are two comments that I wish to make. What is cynicism? Cynicism is attempting to provoke a conflict by shooting both at one’s own side and the other side. Today, a number of my colleagues referred to an alleged attack on a Ukrainian base. I can tell the Council again that there has been no attack on any base. There were not even any Russian soldiers present. Those who were present were unarmed members of the self-defence forces, wearing only bullet-proof jackets, and a sniper posted on a nearby building shot, killed and injured one person on each side. Immediately, the leaders in Kyiv come out with a statement saying that there is now a need to fire on Russian soldiers. Now that is real cynicism. Cynicism is what we saw in the Maidan, where there was an attempt to provoke the violent overthrow of the authorities by shooting at all sides and kill as many protestors as possible, as Mr. Šimonović said today. A professional fired on the crowds, and everyone saw where the shots came from. One well-equipped and well-trained sniper came from the headquarters of the so-called Maidan commandant. That is cynicism. Finally, let me turn to the so-called ultimatum. I do not know why our Ukrainian colleagues refer to this as an ultimatum. Our Western partners have started to consider how to extricate themselves from the crisis in Ukraine and to come up with their own recipes to do so. We in response provided them with our vision of how we could extricate ourselves from the crisis in Ukraine to ensure that all regions feel at rest and secure. The very core of our proposal is entirely in keeping with the agreement of 21 February. There needs to be a constitutional process whereby all regions would feel that their rights were being defended within the framework of the Ukrainian State. That is not an ultimatum to Kyiv, but something we have discussed with our partners. In my statement today, I said that we stand ready to continue such dialogue. I have a feeling that there is something in our proposal that our French colleague does not like. That is the impression I am left with. But we did not submit it as a draft resolution of the Security Council. It was discussed by Secretary of State Kerry and Minister Lavrov in great detail. They tabled their documents; we tabled ours. What is unusual about any of this? I do not see anything unusual in all of this, and if there is something that he does not like, let us sit down and discuss the specific points that you do not like. That is standard diplomatic process. ","I thank the Deputy Secretary-General for his briefing. We welcome the Secretary-General’s intent to travel to Moscow and Kyiv this week. We hope that his visit will help to persuade President Putin to step back, to de-escalate the siutation, to fulfil Russia’s obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, to allow the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and United Nations monitors full access to Crimea, and to engage in dialogue with Ukraine. We also thank Mr. Šimonović for his briefing. It is inexcusable that he was denied access to Crimea, but we applaud his efforts to gather information from the peninsula via other means. His report on the extent of human rights violations in Crimea is of serious concern. Cases of arbitrary arrest, detention, torture, ill-treatment, disappearances and population displacements directly contradict Russia’s claims to the contrary. We share Mr. Šimonović’s concerns about the gross human rights violations that took place under the previous Ukrainian Government. In that context, we welcome the new Ukrainian Government’s request for United Nations monitors to investigate those concerns and its commitment to reflect Ukraine’s rich linguistic, ethnic and cultural diversity. We urge the rapid deployment of the United Nations monitors across the country. Last Saturday, 14 Council members underlined their commitment to Ukraine’s unity and territorial integrity (see S/PV.7138). Russia was urged to distance itself from the referendum set to take place the next day in Crimea. Our aim was to avoid further escalation and to ask Russia to heed the views of the international community. Russia has rejected that message. It rejected it on Saturday by vetoing a draft resolution that carried the overwhelming support of the Council. Yesterday, following the referendum, it underlined its disregard for our appeals for calm and for de-escalation by announcing new laws to incorporate Crimea into the Russian Federation. The Permanent Representative of Russia spoke about that process being in compliance with international law, without outside interference and through a democratic process. It is hard to know which of those three assertions is the biggest lie. Sunday’s referendum was a mockery of democratic practice. It was illegal under the Ukrainian Constitution, arranged at 10 days’ notice, met none of the OSCE standards for democratic elections, was held under Russian military occupation and gave the people of Crimea no option to vote for the status quo. Neither the referendum nor the succession of increasingly desperate, contradictory and inconsistent legal arguments put forward by Russia can conceal the stark reality of that country’s actions. Russia has annexed part of the sovereign territory of an independent State Member of the United Nations through the use of military force. Russia claims not to be bound by any of its previous obligations and commitments in respect of Ukraine, including the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, on the grounds that it does not regard the new Government in Ukraine as legitimate. However, treaties and international agreements are between States, not Governments. A change in Government in Kyiv does not absolve Russia from its international obligations and commitments. We are witnessing the illegal behaviour of a large country bullying its neighbours, disregarding international norms and unilaterally adjusting internationally recognized borders to its own advantage. Yesterday, in his speech to the Federation Council, President Putin said: “In the hearts and conscience of the people, Crimea has always been, and remains, an inalienable part of Russia”. He went on to add that, because Crimea was a strategic territory, it needed to be under the strong and stable sovereignty of Russia. Now, at last, after weeks of denial, Russia’s real motives for its military adventurism have been admitted. There are plenty of lessons from history about where that kind of extraordinary logic leads. One only has to think back to the 1930s to recognize the dangers of a complacent international response when such behaviour occurs. The United Nations system and the framework of international norms that it embodies were the response of our forefathers to a global conflict that resulted from lawless aggression. The United Nations was designed to provide security to us all by preventing the subjugation of any State. We all therefore have an interest in upholding the international framework and norms that the United Nations represents. Russian actions throw into doubt the credibility of that international order. That is why they should be clearly condemned and why Russia must now face further consequences for its actions. Russia cannot be granted the impunity to disregard international law and the Charter of the United Nations. Even at this late stage, Russia has the option to change course, to heed the message of the international community and to engage in dialogue with Ukraine. Last week, in the Council, we all heard the Ukrainian Prime Minister offer to open up such a dialogue with Russia (see S/PV.7134). Yet, so far, even that basic step has been rejected. The situation in Ukraine and the region is serious. Yesterday, another threshold was passed when a Ukrainian serviceman was killed during the storming of a Ukrainian military compound in Crimea by forces aligned with Russia. There are credible reports of Russian-inspired provocations across eastern and southern Ukraine. We praise the continuing and remarkable restraint of the Ukrainian military. However, such actions only underline how close we are to a further dramatic escalation. The issue extends far beyond Ukraine’s imperilled borders. The issue before us is about respect for bilateral and international treaties. It is about upholding the Charter of the United Nations and international law. Those are the frameworks on which we all rely and that Russia is challenging. We have a collective responsibility to defend everything that we have worked so hard to build over the past 70 years. ","I wish to thank Deputy Secretary-General Eliasson and Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for their briefings. The representative of the Russian Federation began his statement extolling the so-called referendum as embodying democratic procedures and having been conducted without outside interference. Russia is known for its literary greatness, and what the Council just heard from the Russian Ambassador showed more imagination than Tolstoy or Chekhov. Russia has decided, it seems, to rewrite its borders, but it cannot rewrite the facts. The United States rejects Russia’s military intervention and land grab in Crimea. Those actions again violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, Russia’s own binding agreements, international law, the expressed will of most members of the Council and the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. Two days ago, President Obama and other world leaders put in place sanctions in response to Russia’s blatant disregard for global opinion and the legal rights of Ukraine. We are prepared to take additional steps if Russian aggression or Russian provocations continue. In this Chamber, when the crisis began, the Russian Federation described its intervention into Crimea as a human rights protection mission. It claimed that the recent change of Government in Ukraine constituted such a danger to ethnic Russians in Crimea that military action was justified. Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović’s briefing once again illustrates that the crisis was never about protecting the rights of ethnic Russians and was always about one country’s ambition to redraw its own borders. Indeed, if there was ever a time to be concerned about human rights in Crimea, it is now. Credible reports indicate that cases of harassment have been directed by Russian allies against ethnic Ukrainians and Tatars. The Tatar community, which constitutes 12 per cent of the population, is rightly fearful of again falling victim to deportation or discrimination. The Crimean First Deputy Prime Minister has recently announced that Crimean Tatars will be evicted from some of their land, which he claimed is needed for “infrastructure projects”. The body of Reshat Ahmetov, a Crimean Tatar, was discovered Sunday. He had last been seen at a protest in Simferopol on 3 March. Ahmetov’s body reportedly showed signs of torture. Russian troops are reportedly storming apartment buildings housing Ukrainian troops, border guards, veterans and their families, threatening them and demanding their immediate departure. In addition, we are seriously concerned about activists, civil society leaders, media restrictions and journalists in Crimea. Accordingly, the United States supports the rapid deployment of international observers in all parts of Ukraine. We believe it is instructive that the Government of Ukraine has repeatedly welcomed their deployment, and the Russian Federation has not. Again today in Vienna, Russia was the lone country to block an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe monitoring mission. There, Russia was dramatically outnumbered. It was the lone dissenting voice out of 57 countries; 56, it seemed, had a different view. Russian officials say that they understand the urgency, but they vote with their feet, relying on their military forces and refusing to allow the deployment of those who could help defuse the crisis and prevent further violence. After hearing my Russian colleague’s assault minutes ago on the Assistant Secretary- General’s briefing, I see the logic of Russian obstruction. Objective information is inconvenient to the Russian tale. We call on all parties to support these observer missions, including their access to Crimea. We want to thank members of the Council for taking a strong stance on Russia’s intervention in Ukraine and for making it clear that Russia stands alone in its failed, illogical and mendacious attempt to justify actions that cannot be justified. Five days ago, when the Council accurately described the Crimean separatist referendum as invalid, only a single hand rose in opposition. When the Council declared that the referendum could not form the basis for any alteration of the status of Crimea, only a single hand rose in opposition. Now the referendum has taken place, but the national and international legal status of Crimea has not changed. A thief can steal property, but that does not confer the right of ownership on the thief. In conclusion, let me just emphasize again that what Russia has done is wrong as a matter of law, wrong as a matter of history, wrong as a matter of policy, and dangerous. What happened in Crimea cannot be recognized as valid. We must stand together denying recognition and imposing consequences for that illegal act. In doing so, we must also be very clear that what happened in Crimea cannot be repeated in other parts of Ukraine. ",,,,,,,,,,,"I thank the Council for convening this meeting and for inviting me. I would like to start by expressing my gratitude to all Council members who addressed my Mission today with words of condolences to the family of the Ukrainian soldier who was killed yesterday after being shot in his neck when a group of gunmen stormed the Ukrainian military base in the north-east of Crimea, in Simferopol. Yesterday our Foreign Minister protested against all hostile and provocative actions of the Russian Federdation’s armed forces, which caused the death of the Ukrainian soldier.
Today we observed tremendous changes in the situation in Crimea, but unfortunately those changes are not for good. As we have envisaged in other previous statements, the illegitimate referendum on the issue of the annexation of the territory of Crimea to the Russian Federation was conducted in an expedited manner on 16 March. Following immediately after the referendum, on 18 March, the President of the Russian Federation defiantly signed the agreement on its accession to the Russian Federation, which is supposed to be ratified by the Parliament of the Russian Federation on 21 March.
We consider all those acts to be illegitimate and we call upon the entire civilized world not to recognize the illegitimately declared independence of Crimea and its violent dismembering from the territory of the country.
I would like to thank the Deputy Secretary-General and the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights for their important briefings on the situation of human rights in Ukraine. For our part, I would like to say only that the real violation of human rights is taking place on the territory of the Crimean peninsula, which is currently under the total control of the illegitimate authorities of Crimea.
First of all, there are serious reservations about the expressed free will of the population of that region of Ukraine, because since 26 February, the armed forces of the Russian Federation have, de facto, occupied Crimea. Let me provide the Council with some of the facts of the human rights violations that occurred during the illegal referendum.
Some ballots were distributed to voters who were not registered at the voting site, including nationals of other countries. Russian citizens with a residency permit in Simferopol were able to get a ballot for the referendum and in fact to vote. But those who did not go to polling stations were visited by mobile voting teams, escorted by police, thus forcing people to vote. Journalists were banned, despite having valid credentials. Additional voters lists included large numbers of citizens who were not qualified to vote. Contrary to existing elections provisions, ballots were issued immediately after submitting a registration application to a supplementary list, without a vote by the Commission members having taken place.
Even the results of the illegal referendum are very doubtful because of the decision made by the Crimean Tartars — who include about 300,000 people — to boycott. Ethnic Ukrainians, who make up about half a million people, and national minority populations in Crimea did not take part in the referendum. The referendum ballots indicated two questions as options, neither of which provided for maintaining the present status as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea; rather, they only referred to accession to the Russian Federation.
The personalities of foreign observers who were invited to Crimea to monitor the referendum raised serious doubts regarding impartiality.
Once again, I would like to emphasize the illegality of the referendum. Even without regard for the laws or sovereign territorial jurisdiction of Ukraine, of which the Autonomous Republic of Crimea is a subject, self-proclaimed authorities in Crimea held a referendum on 16 March that violated not only Ukraine’s current legislation but also the fundamental rules of international law enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, the Statute of the Council of Europe and other documents, including of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the 1991 Alma-Ata Declaration regarding the Commonwealth of Independent States.
An abundance of evidence, including photographs and videotaped materials, eyewitness accounts of events, including those of foreign nationals, prove that the conditions of the so-called referendum failed to meet the democratic standards of referendums developed under the framework of the OSCE and the Council of Europe. The declaration of independence by the Crimean Republic is a direct consequence of the application of the use of force and threats against Ukraine by the Russian Federation. Given the Russian nuclear power status, the situation is particularly dangerous in terms of Ukraine’s independence and territorial integrity and for international peace and security in general. Accordingly, I assert that, on the basis of customary norms and international law, the international community is obliged not to recognize Crimea as a subject of international law, or any situation, treaty or agreement that may arise or be achieved by that territory.
My country expresses its strong and imperative protest against the recognition of the Russian Federation of the self-proclaimed republic, as a matter of international law. Those actions by the Russian side do not meet the international obligations of the Russian Federation in relation to its multilateral and bilateral agreements guaranteeing the territorial integrity of Ukraine, the integrity and inviolability of borders and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.
The independence of that formation was declared by an illegitimate authority based on the results of the anti-constitutional referendum held under outrageous violations of the democratic standards. Russia’s recognition of the self-proclaimed republic of Crimea has one single goal: to create pseudo-legitimate reasons for the annexation of the territory of Ukraine and its incorporation into the Russian Federation.
We are seriously concerned about the security of the ethnic Ukrainians, Ukrainian Tartars, Karaims and other ethnic groups living in Crimea that have not supported the so-called referendum. Their lives are seriously threatened.
In conclusion, I would like to echo my Council colleagues. Ukraine and the entire civilized world will never recognize the illegitimately declared independence of Crimea and its accession to the Russian Federation. I would like to thank you personally, Madam President, for convening this meeting. I would like to thank all the members of the Council for inviting me to take part in it. I am grateful to the Deputy Secretary-General and the Assistant Secretary-General for their briefings. I would like to extend my gratitude to all who, in their statements, expressed support for the territorial integrity of my country and raised strong objections concerning the illegitimacy of the referendum in Crimea. I will now say a few words in Russian, as is becoming customary.
(spoke in Russian)
I should like to comment on a few elements of the statement of my colleague from the Russian Federation. It is very complicated and to a large extent unpleasant to make comments regarding some of the statements made by my Russian colleague. It is very difficult to comment on what is blatantly false, because it puts one in a position of having justify oneself. Regarding the freedom of expression and access to information in Ukraine, does Mr. Churkin know the difference between freedom of expression and access to information in Ukraine and in Russia? All the webcasts of the Security Council are broadcast in Ukraine on all channels, without editing. Not everything that was heard here today will sound pleasant to the ears of Ukrainians. There were a great many recommendations made here today that contain elements critical of Ukraine, but we are ready to listen to all of that.
The only things that are heard in the Russian media are Russian statements. Yesterday, I met with a women’s non-governmental organization that participated in the Women’s Forum at the United Nations. One of the women was from Odessa, another from Donetsk and the third was from Chernihiv. All were Russian speakers. They turned to me and asked: “How can the whole world, watching on television, be told such lies as are heard in many of the statements made by representatives of the Russian Federation?” How could I answer them?
The means justify the ends? That is probably the only answer.
I have two comments that it simply behoves me to make. My Russian colleague characterized as blasphemy the decision of the Ukrainian authorities yesterday to allow our military in Crimea to use weapons in self-defence, following the death of their fellow soldier. Today, we have heard that it is blasphemy because they are raising their weapons against their fellow countrymen. This is odd. The feeling one is left with is that it is Ukraine that has launched an attack by bringing its forces in, as opposed to the truth, which is that Russia three weeks ago deployed its forces throughout the sovereign territory of Ukraine — and this at the beginning of the Orthodox Easter, at the time when believers were to gather. I believe that there is an excess of cynicism and untruth here.
(spoke in English)
Ukraine keeps saying that we are ready for dialogue. We started with a request to our Russian colleagues to hold consultations under the bilateral agreement. We invited all guarantors under the Budapest Memorandum to convene a meeting as provided for by that document. The Russian Federation refused. We are ready for further dialogue, and we acknowledge the recent proposal made by the Russian Federation. But what is disappointing is that these are not proposals; they are ultimatums and demands as to how Ukraine should build its future. We do not like these ultimatums because they are open interference in our domestic affairs. We would like to have dialogue.
We applaud the efforts of the Secretary-General over recent weeks and we expect that his meetings in Moscow in Kyiv will lead to some positive developments. I thank my colleagues in the Chamber for their support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I, too, would like to thank Deputy Secretary-General Eliasson and Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for their briefings and our colleague from Ukraine for his statement.
Last Sunday, a hastily crafted illegal referendum took place in Ukraine’s Crimea — a referendum held in a region cut off from its mainland and the rest of the world by another country’s armed forces and under a heavy barrage of aggressive anti-Ukrainian propaganda.
Representatives of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe and key United Nations national and regional organizations with outstanding experience in human rights monitoring and the organization and observation of elections were all prevented from entering Crimea. The plebiscite was organized in a record short period of time, probably a first in the practice of referendums, without nationwide preparations or consultations. Not a single credible international observer was present to verify and ascertain that this hurried referendum was free and fair. Those facts alone are sufficient to raise alarms about the quality of the referendum and its fraudulence.
At the same time, notably while representatives of major international organizations, monitors and observers were prevented from entering Crimea, more than 100 so-called “independent referendum observers”, as our French colleague has stated, who were well-established hard-line nationalists, Nazi sympathizers, deniers of the Holocaust, anti-semites, deniers of the massacre of Srebrenica and Islamophobes — hardly a company to keep for those who claim to protect Europe, Ukraine and Crimea from fascism — were able to observe and to ascertain that allegedly the referendum was fine and fair.
The indigenous Tatar population, for whom Crimea is the only place on Earth they can call home and whose massive deportation by Stalin in cattle cars is still very much alive in their collective memory, called to boycott the election as contrary to their desire to be an integral part of Ukraine. How about their right to self-determination?
The so-called referendum is nothing but an undisguised land grab and a blatant violation by Russia of the Charter of the United Nations, international law, as well as bilateral and multilateral agreements and commitments. A country which should have been a guarantor of Ukraine’s sovereignty, as per the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, breached its legal responsibility towards Ukraine to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity in exchange for its renunciation of nuclear weapons. How does that bode for the non-proliferation regime?
Sunday’s referendum is nothing else but a fraudulent sham whose sole purpose was to rubber-stamp the illegal annexation of a part of Ukraine. As such, it cannot be recognized by the international community. Lithuania once again calls on all States to reject that act, not to recognize the illegal joining of a part of the territory of sovereign Ukraine to the Russian Federation and to reaffirm their support for the principles of the United Nations Charter and the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine.
How deeply ironic is the fact that, carried out under the false pretext of protecting human and minority rights, the aggression against Crimea is carried out by pro-Russian militants with Moscow’s support, causing serious and repeated human rights violations against the Crimean population through incitement against Ukrainians, extreme censorship, shutting down media outlets and press hubs, cases of arbitrary arrest, detention and enforced disappearances, routine attacks against journalists, vandalism, beatings and other ill-treatment?
Furthermore, the outcome of the referendum and the rushed admittance of Crimea into the Russian fold will further infringe upon the rights of large numbers of Crimea’s inhabitants, who will be forced to make heart-rending choices regarding their loyalty to the Ukrainian State and their citizenship, with serious consequences for their families, their property rights and their future.
One country appropriating at will a part of a neighbouring country is a profoundly disturbing signal to everyone that, once again, territories are up for grabs and that the international norms guaranteeing the sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of States can be rewritten by force. Who will be next? ","My delegation thanks Deputy Secretary-General Eliasson and Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for their updates on the recent developments in Ukraine. From the outset, we with to reiterate the Deputy Secretary-General’s observation that the door for dialogue to resolve the crisis in Ukraine is still open, not closed. We hope that all of the parties involved and concerned will take advantage of that.
This is the eighth time in three weeks that the Security Council has met on the situation in Ukraine. This underscores the seriousness with which the Council views the matter and its commitment to addressing issues related to international peace and security. Nigeria has consistently highlighted and stressed the need for dialogue, especially between the parties directly concerned, and for mediation by the rest of the international community to ensure that the situation in Ukraine is resolved peacefully.
We reaffirm our earlier warning that the world has too many challenges to international peace and security to contemplate adding another layer to existing ones. All peaceful means, including mediation, arbitration and dialogue, must be explored and used to the hilt by the parties concerned. Further escalation of the situation with hurtful rhetoric would only leave to grave consequences, including military confrontation, which the world can ill afford, especially when nuclear-weapon States are involved. The world would therefore not want to see any further deterioration in the situation as this could have grave implications, not just for Ukraine, but for the entire region and beyond. The Deputy Secretary-General’s report was clear on that point.
With regard to the human rights situation in Ukraine, we welcome the deployment by Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović of a United Nations monitoring team throughout the country to establish the truth or otherwise or alleged human rights violations. Nigeria once again urges all parties to embrace dialogue and negotiation, and to seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis. We call on all concerned to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in line with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. ","Jordan would like to express its concerns following the events of the crisis in Ukraine, especially in Crimea, given the fact that efforts undertaken to achieve a peaceful solution have unfortunately not yet been successful. We would like to reiterate the need to protect the sovereignty of Ukraine, its territorial integrity and its political independence. All territories and regions of Ukraine, including Crimea, fall under Ukrainian sovereignty. That fact is recognized by the international community and established by international law and, of course, the Charter of the United Nations, which is further complemented by relevant international treaties, such as the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 and the Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership between Ukraine and the Russian Federation of 1997.
We wish to reaffirm the fact that the instrument that governs all regions and parts of Ukraine’s territory is the Constitution, which guarantees its territorial integrity and unity throughout all regions and parts of the country. That is why it is simply unacceptable to split off a part of its territory and have another country annex it. The international community should spare no effort to tackle the crisis and to encourage the parties to reach a solution that would protect their legitimate interests and rights, which would result, of course, in a return of Crimea to Ukrainian control.
There is also a need to establish the necessary guarantees to protect the interests of the various sides. If ever an agreement were to be concluded to put an end to the crisis, it should include guarantees of minorities’ rights in Ukraine. We urge the United Nations to use its good offices to reconcile the positions of the two parties and to come up with a mechanism that would enable us to initiate dialogue and make progress.
Clearly, the time has come to set up an international contact group to achieve that objective, to work with all parties on the ground and to cooperate with the various monitoring and observation groups, which could be deployed to verify the situation throughout all regions in Ukraine, including Crimea. The various parties to the crisis should refrain from actions that would lead to escalation. They should give pride of place to reconciliation, common sense and logic, and work with international organizations within the framework of the existing forums. Such an effort would spare the world from the negative consequences of the crisis and its impact on international peace and security.","I thank Deputy Secretary-General Eliasson, Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović and Permanent Representative of Ukraine Sergeyev for their statements.
The Security Council is meeting at a sensitive moment. The 16 March referendum was held in Crimea and has been judged as unconstitutional and has been seen as undermining the territorial integrity of Ukraine, a sovereign State Member of the United Nations. The circumstances around the vote has led to worry in the international community, which questions its legitimacy. The holding of the referendum has no doubt contributed to the worsening of the situation. Chile would reiterate the need to restore the rule of law and respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in keeping with the Charter of the United Nations and international law.
The death of a Ukrainian soldier in an assault in one of the military barracks in Crimea and the increased tensions in the eastern part of the country reveal an escalation of the crisis that has to be stopped. In that context, we value the briefings of Deputy Secretary- General Eliasson and Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Šimonović.
In truth, we are observing a growing deterioration of the situation. Chile believes that it is necessary to broaden the space for a solution through diplomacy. That is why we endorse the efforts of the Organization and, most especially, the efforts being undertaken by the Secretary-General.
Chile regrets that Mr. Šimonović and observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe were not allowed to enter Crimea. We call for the actions of the United Nations not to be impeded, with a view to ensuring timely and truthful information in order to be able to assess the human rights situation on the ground. The situation of ethnic minorities in Crimea is of concern for us, especially that of the Tatar minorities, who have started moving to other areas of Ukraine. The existence of internally displaced persons is the clearest sign of a worsening of the crisis. That fact strengthens the call of the international community to seek a negotiated solution.
It is indispensable that the Council contribute to and generate maximum restraint and moderation among both parties. Accordingly, it makes a new appeal for all sides to avoid unilateral actions that might escalate the crisis still further. Now is the time for constructive participation in an inclusive process that would guarantee the rule of law, human rights, fundamental freedoms and respect for human rights.","I would like to thank Mr. Eliasson and Mr. Šimonović for their briefings. I would also like to thank the Permanent Representative of Ukraine for his statement.
Chad is alarmed by what is taking place in Ukraine, including in Crimea. We note with a great deal of concern that, despite the repeated calls by the international community, in particular the Security Council, the undermining of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine continues.
We reaffirm once again that we are committed to the unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and we urge all parties to comply with the basic principles of the Charter of the United Nations, including Article 2. We ask all the relevant parties to give pride of place to a peaceful settlement. We support the good offices of the Secretary-General aimed at forging direct dialogue between the two parties to achieve a political solution.","I thank the Deputy Secretary-General for his briefing and Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for his statement. I also thank Ukraine Ambassador Sergeyev.
As we know, five days ago, the Council sought to adopt a draft resolution on Ukraine reaffirming fundamental principles of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations. The draft resolution was opposed by only one State: Russia. The message of Council members to Russia, reflecting the views of the broader international community, nevertheless, remains clear. It must comply with international law, take active steps to de-escalate the crisis and engage in dialogue towards a peaceful resolution of it.
But the fact is that Russia has steadfastly ignored that message. It has moved to annex Crimea on the basis of a referendum that was manifestly unlawful and illegitimate, not least because it was carried out while Russian forces exercised effective control over Crimea. President Putin’s signature of a decree recognizing Crimean independence and of a purported treaty with Crimean leaders and the presidential approval of a draft bill on the annexation of Crimea do not validate the referendum, nor do they provide any legitimate basis for Russia’s acquisition of part of the territory of Ukraine. Indeed, Russia’s actions are a clear violation of the fundamental principles of international law, which were contained in the draft resolution it vetoed on Saturday: respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the illegality of the acquisition of territory by the threat or use of force. Those remain the international community’s touchstone, and the international community will not recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea.
Russia has further strengthened its military control of Crimea in recent days, dramatically escalating tensions. Incidents involving the use of armed force, the occupation of military bases and the killing of a Ukrainian soldier and the wounding of another significantly increase the stakes and make a descent into conflict more likely.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Yatsenyuk has sought an immediate meeting of Ministers of Defence of the parties to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, which provided security guarantees to Ukraine, in order to prevent further escalation of the crisis, and we urge Russia to respond positively to that request. He has sent Ukraine’s First Deputy Prime Minister and the Acting Defence Minister to Crimea to de-escalate the crisis. It is crucial that that direct dialogue take place.
The Secretary-General’s travel to Moscow and Kyiv over the next few days is clearly welcome, and we urge all parties to engage in constructive dialogue with him.
In pursuing its current course of action, Russia has chosen a path towards isolation. In doing so, it undermines its own standing, credibility and relations with other States and increasingly poses a threat to security and stability in the region. Inevitably, there are consequences for its unlawful action. In addition to measures put in place by others, the Australian Government announced, on 19 March, that it would impose targeted measures against individuals who have been instrumental in the Russian threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We have not taken those steps lightly and have done so with regret, only after repeatedly urging Russia to de-escalate and engage in diplomatic dialogue to resolve the crisis.
An important first step for Russia will be to recognize the need for and support the deployment of monitors on the ground. We encourage Russia to engage constructively in support of an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) monitoring mission to Ukraine. Such a mission should be deployed as a matter of priority. Given the allegations raised by Russia about serious infringement of the human rights of Russian speakers in Crimea and elsewhere in Ukraine, it is obviously important that those allegations continue to be independently assessed, especially as the OSCE High Commissioner for National Minorities found no evidence of violations or threats to Russian speakers in Crimea during her recent visit. As Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović has just reported to us, the violations he has learned of are neither widespread nor systematic. On the other hand, Crimea’s Tatar community clearly feel threatened. Mr. Šimonović has noted there are credible reports that a Tatar activist has been tortured and murdered. There are also reports that Ukrainian civil society activists have been abducted. Those violations must cease. Ongoing human rights monitoring is essential, and we welcome the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights team that is already being done and their continued deployment, but such monitoring must also take place in Crimea.
In conclusion, we are obviously at a critical point for Ukraine and the region and for the integrity of the rules-based international order itself. All Member States have a direct interest in the preservation of that order.
As the Deputy Secretary-General has underlined again today, the crisis must be resolved peacefully through diplomatic means and direct dialogue. Such a resolution must respect Ukraine’s unity and territorial integrity. It is up to Russia to commit to finding such a solution. It is not too late for it to turn from the deliberate path of provocation and isolation that it has taken. ",,,,"Thank you, Madam President, for convening this meeting on the situation in Ukraine. It shows the seriousness of the situation and the commitment of the Security Council in the quest for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. I also thank Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson and Assistant Secretary-General Ivan Šimonović for their respective briefings on the political, security and human rights situation in Ukraine.
Rwanda is still concerned about the prevailing rhetoric in Ukraine and the region and the continued demonstrations and violence in the cities of eastern Ukraine. Something needs to be done, and that begins with a commitment from all parties, with a sense of urgency, to resume dialogue, in order to avoid further escalation of the situation.
We continue to commend the role of the United Nations in that regard. We look forward to the visit of the Secretary-General to the Russian Federation and Ukraine, scheduled for tomorrow, 20 March, and we hope that his visit will help all the parties involved and regional organizations to find a political and diplomatic solution that will benefit Ukrainians and all the peoples of the region. We welcome the deployment of a United Nations human rights monitoring team in Ukraine, and we count on all stakeholders to extend full cooperation to the team. We indeed believe that only an independent body will be able to objectively establish the facts on alleged human rights violations.
Rwanda has been calling for constructive efforts to de-escalate the situation, and we continue to advocate for a political and diplomatic solution to the conflict, with the engagement of the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union and the Russian Federation at the international level, and for inclusive talks at the national level among all Ukrainian parties that ensure equal participation by all communities in the country while protecting minorities. In the meantime, we call on all Ukrainian parties to respect the rule of law and exercise maximum restraint. We urge the regional and international actors to avoid any diplomatic, economic, political or even military move that would further escalate the situation.
In conclusion, let me stress that the Security Council, which is the world’s only body in charge of the maintenance of international peace and security, must work towards restoring its own unity, in order to be able to defend the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of a United Nations State Member while addressing the interests of all the countries of the region. ","First of all, I wish to thank Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson and Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Ivan Šimonović for their respective briefings. I also thank the Permanent Representative of Ukraine for his participation in today’s meeting of the Security Council.
Argentina is following with great concern the unfolding of the situation in Ukraine. The delegation of Argentina once again reiterates the fundamental importance of adhering to the principles that we have all subscribed to as Members of the United Nations.
For Argentina, it is essential to respect the primacy of the principle of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of all States. Therefore, in speaking in support of the draft resolution that was put to a vote on 15 March, I said that my country had sustained that principle throughout its history, even before the existence of the United Nations, and it will continue steadfastly to do so.
Argentina does not comment on the internal developments in Ukraine that have led to the current institutional crisis in the country because we understand that all countries should refrain from intervening militarily, economically or politically in the internal affairs of other States and should adjust its actions so that they are in strict compliance to international law and the Charter of the United Nations. In that context, we urge that human rights and international humanitarian law be scrupulously observed and that the rights of all minorities — be they ethnic, linguistic, cultural or religious — be upheld. We are concerned about the past violence and the current violence — and the possibility that it might worsen. We regret that, despite repeated calls, the rhetoric of confrontation has not been abandoned in Ukraine. It is incumbent upon all of us to refrain from encouraging dissent or escalating confrontations that could become a threat to international peace and security. Indeed, it is the most influential actors who should be calling for constructive diplomacy.
Finally, we support the mediation efforts that are being undertaken by various United Nations officials, as well as the good offices of the Secretary-General. We understand that this situation cannot be resolved by unilateral acts. We therefore stress that actions that complicate the situation and that lead us further away from a political and peaceful solution to the crisis must be avoided. ","I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Luxembourg.
I thank Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson and Mr. Ivan Šimonović, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, for their briefings. I also thank the Permanent Representative of Ukraine to the United Nations, Ambassador Yuriy Sergeyev, for his statement.
It cannot be emphasized enough — the referendum held on 16 March in the Crimea violated the Constitution of Ukraine, which provides that the territory of Ukraine is indivisible and inviolable. In addition, the election was held in conditions that forfeited all legitimacy. Crimea was occupied and cut off from the rest of Ukraine, journalists and members of civil society were intimidated, and media freedom was severely hampered. Representatives of the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) who had been invited by the Ukrainian Government were denied access to the Crimea.
The international community in no way recognizes the result of this illegal and unconstitutional referendum. Similarly, the international community does not recognize any measure to integrate the Ukrainian Autonomous Republic of Crimea within the Russian Federation via the referendum. We welcome the very broad convergence of views on this issue in the Security Council.
Russia’s actions on Ukrainian territory over the past three weeks flagrantly violate international law, particularly the Charter of the United Nations and the Helsinki Final Act. They contradict the commitments made by Russia regarding Ukraine in the framework of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum and the Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership signed in 1997 between Russia and Ukraine. Luxembourg is deeply concerned about the rising tensions in Crimea caused by the illegal presence of armed Russian forces outside their authorized area. It is urgently necessary to defuse the crisis through military de-escalation, starting with the immediate withdrawal of Russian forces to their pre-crisis permanent areas of deployment. We welcome the calm and restraint shown by the Ukrainian authorities to date in the face of the violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of their country. However, we consider the death of a Ukrainian officer killed yesterday by bullets during the attack on a military base in Simferopol of greatest concern. Today, there are reports of attacks on Ukrainian armed forces bases, including the headquarters of the Ukrainian navy in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. In the present context, every incident could become the spark that ignites the fire.
To address the crisis, we believe that the United Nations has a role to play in close cooperation with the OSCE, the Council of Europe and other organizations. We regret that it was not possible for the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights to visit Crimea. Nevertheless, Mr. Šimonović’s briefing, based on the evidence he collected, tends to confirm the observation made two weeks ago by the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities. The main reason given by the Russia to legitimize its actions — threats to the rights of Russian speakers and communities in Crimea — have turned out to be unfounded. It was not the actions of the Government in Kyiv or the Ukrainian authorities but Russia’s military escalation that fostered a climate of impunity and an increase in human rights violations in Crimea. The situation threatens seriously to disrupt the balance between the various communities that have coexisted peacefully until now in Crimea.
We welcome the efforts of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to quickly deploy observers, under the “Rights up front” action plan of the Secretary-General, to monitor the human rights situation of throughout Ukrainian territory. The observers can establish the facts and report objectively in order to halt the spread of unfounded allegations geared to exacerbate tensions. We hope that the team of observers will soon be fully operational and that it will also go to Crimea and eastern Ukraine. In the same vein, we hope that the presence of the international community throughout Ukraine will be reinforced as soon as possible by the establishment of a special OSCE observer mission. Its implementation should be delayed no further. In general, we encourage the United Nations to pursue its good offices in the crisis between Ukraine and Russia. In that respect, we applaud the visit planned by the Secretary-General to Moscow and Kyiv in the next few days. Even if they have not yet borne fruit, diplomatic efforts must continue intensively to achieve a solution that respects the political independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine.
I now resume my functions as President of the Council.
The representative of the Russian Federation has asked to make a further statement. ","We thank Deputy Secretary-General Eliasson and Assistant Secretary-General Šimonović for their briefings and for the devotion they have shown in their activities taken with respect to Ukraine.
The Republic of Korea is deeply concerned about the recent developments in that country. The Republic of Korea will not recognize the referendum in Crimea nor the annexation of Crimea by Russia. We call on Russia and the Crimean authorities to refrain from further hasty actions. We urge them to immediately enter into meaningful discussions with the Ukrainian Government and the international community, with a view to finding a peaceful political solution.
Implications of any boundary alterations on the existing international order must be fully taken into account. We hope that space exists for a negotiated way forward. In that context, we greatly value the ongoing mediation efforts by the international community, particularly those of the Secretary-General. We look forward to the continued constructive role of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in that regard.
Once again, we reiterate our firm support for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine. All the relevant international and bilateral agreements, especially the Charter of the United Nations and the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, must be fully observed. It is also vital that the rights of all persons in Ukraine, especially of minorities, be protected. The future of Ukraine should be considered and decided upon based only upon the will and aspirations of all Ukrainians themselves, without any intervention or influence by outside forces. "
S/PV.7138,15/03/2014,Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation,"The current situation in Ukraine is highly complex and sensitive and has regional and international repercussions. The international community should together engage in pushing through a political solution to the crisis in Ukraine so as to truly maintain peace and stability in the region. What we are seeing Ukraine today is the result of a complex intertwinement of historical and contemporary factors. The situation in Ukraine, which seems to be accidental, has elements of the inevitable, and therefore calls for a comprehensive and balanced solution. China always respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States. Those are long-standing and fundamental elements of China’s foreign policy. At the same time, we note that foreign interference is also a significant factor, giving rise to violent clashes on the streets of Ukraine and resulting in the crisis in the country. The failure to implement the 21 February agreement has further exacerbated the turmoil in Ukraine, with serious social and economic consequences for the country. We condemn and oppose all extreme and violent acts. The key to resolving the crisis in Ukraine is to act within the framework of law and order, seeking an early solution to the differences through dialogue and negotiations, with due respect for the legitimate rights and interests of all those in the various communities and regions. All parties should move forward in the overall aim of maintaining regional peace and stability and of protecting the fundamental interests of all the communities in Ukraine in order to keep calm, exercise restraint and prevent a further escalation of the tension, while resolutely seeking a political solution so as to find a specific way out as soon as possible. China has been calling for constructive efforts and the good offices of the international community to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine. We note the new developments and proposals in that regard. Drafting a resolution at this juncture will only lead to confrontation and further complicate the situation. It is not in line with the common interests of both the people of Ukraine and the international community. On the basis of the above, we could only abstain in the voting on the draft resolution (S/2014/189). China holds a fair and impartial position on the issue of Ukraine. We will continue to mediate and to promote dialogue so as to play a greater contructive role in seeking a political solution to the crisis in Ukraine. To that end, we would like to make three proposals. The first proposal is the establishment as soon as possible of an international coordination mechanism, comprising all the parties concerned, in order to explore means for the political settlement of the Ukrainian crisis. Secondly, in the meanwhile, all parties should refrain from taking any action that may further escalate the situation. Thirdly, international financial institutions should start to examine how to help to maintain the economic and financial stability of Ukraine. ","It is with a sense of disbelief that we find ourselves here today — disbelief at the situation that developed before our eyes with the Russian Federation’s determination to annex Crimea. Nothing is lacking from those things that we hoped were relegated to the vaults of history: the military maneuvres at the borders, the henchman who yesterday was no one and today has suddenly been designated President of the Crimea, the occupation denied against all evidence, the torrents of propaganda, and now the charade of a referendum that is not only illegal, rushed and without electoral campaigns but is reduced to a choice between two ways of saying yes. Crimeans will not even be able to express their will. The violation of international law is so obvious at this point that one almost feels pity at seeing Russian diplomacy — so formalistic, so finicky in its respect for proprieties and its invocation of texts — struggling to find a legal basis for the coup. One day, they brandish an alleged letter from the Head of State who is on the run, and only an unsigned version of that letter is released, disappearing as quickly as it appeared. The next day, they recall the issue of Kosovo. Finally, after what was probably a feverish search through the archives, they even exhume a decolonization case from 1976: the question of Mayotte. They are trying so hard to use all available means in Moscow that they do not want to see that in the latter example, Russia having taken the opposite position from the one it is taking today, that shaky comparison — even if one accepts it — proves that Russia was wrong in 1976 or is wrong now, in 2014. It must choose. I think, however, that my Russian colleague and I will find common ground in a key sentence from the speech of the Soviet Permanent Representative in 1976 on the question of Mayotte, who said: “Any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the integrity territory of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.” (S/PV.1888, p. 8). In reality, nothing will come of those pathetic efforts — certainly not the basis for any legal reasoning. The vetoing of a text that is nothing more than a reminder of the basic principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations is clear proof of that. The headlines can be simple: Russia has vetoed the Charter of the United Nations. In desperation, therefore, Moscow invokes the pretext of protecting Russians who are supposedly threatened in Crimea. I am sure that neighbouring countries that host Russian minorities appreciate this right to interfere that Russia has suddenly claimed for itself . But again, they are out of luck. There has been no violence, as confirmed by journalists and noted by the High Commissioner on National Minorities of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and no trace, as confirmed by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, of the hundreds of thousands of refugees that were predicted. Where have they gone? Do not worry; they never existed. The supposed right does not exist, and there is no violence taking place. We therefore look to history. Crimea was Russian from 1783 to 1954. What does that mean? Will we take out our history books to review our borders or challenge or defend them? What date will we go back to? After all, Crimea was Russian for 170 years but a vassal of Turkey for three centuries. We know only too well that anything can be justified by history, particularly the unjustifiable. Out of all of this — their confused flurry of activity, the speeches that are denied as soon as they are given and the arguments that are forgotten as soon as they are made — only force remains. Basically, it is simple: the Russian veto today is telling us that might is right. Well, no. Force cannot override the law. That would be too serious and too dangerous for every Member State. Our duty is to raise the fragile barrier of law against the brutal nature of international relations, which has led us into two world wars and has cost, as of this very moment, thousands of innocent lives in Syria and elsewhere. To accept the annexation of Crimea would be to give up everything that we are trying to build in this Organization. It would make a mockery of the Charter of the United Nations. It would once again make the sword the supreme arbiter of disputes. The vast majority of Member States will prove, by their refusal to recognize the annexation of the Crimea, that they know that the territorial integrity of one of them is the guarantor of the territorial integrity of all. There are minorities all over the world. What would become of us if they became the pretext for any kind of adventure to be undertaken by an ambitious and enterprising neighbour? What will be the next Crimea? The annexation goes beyond Ukraine. It affects us all. The veto should be a defeat for Russia alone. It should not take us with it. We must remain steadfast in our commitment to the principles it embodies, which are at the heart of the Charter of the United Nations, are our best defence against the return of a past in which Russian aggression against Ukraine emerges. ","Many times, we have put forth in this Chamber the essence of the Russian position regarding the cause and development of the internal crisis in Ukraine. That general context is important to understanding our view of the draft resolution submitted by the United States (S/2014/189) for the Council’s vote today. It is a secret to no one that the Russian Federation will vote against the draft resolution. We cannot go along with its basic assumption, which is to declare illegal the planned referendum of 16 March whereby the people of the Crimean republic will themselves determine their future. The philosophy of the sponsors of the draft resolution runs counter to one of basic principles of international law, the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, enshrined in Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations. That principle is confirmed in the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, and in a number of other decisions of the General Assembly, as well as the Helsinki Final Act of 1975. We do not dispute the principle of the territorial integrity of States. It is indeed very important. It is also understandable that the enjoyment of the right to self-determination involving separation from an existing State is an extraordinary measure, applied when further coexistence within a single State becomes impossible. Moreover, as practice has demonstrated, in the majority of cases, the realization of peoples’ right to self-determination is achieved without the agreement of the central authorities of the State. With respect to Crimea, that case resulted from a legal vacuum generated by an unconstitutional armed coup d’état carried out in Kyiv by radical nationalists in February, as well as by their direct threats to impose their order throughout Ukraine. It should also be noted that generally agreed principles of international law are closely interlinked and that each should be considered in the light of the others, the relevant political context and historic specificities. The political, legal and historic backdrop of the events of today in Ukraine is extremely complicated. In that context, it is useful to recall that up until 1954, Crimea formed part of the Russian Federation. It was given to Ukraine in violation of the norms of that time under Soviet law and without taking into account the views of the people of Crimea, who nevertheless remained within a single State — the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. When the Soviet Union fell, Crimea automatically became part of Ukraine. The view of the people of Crimea was once again ignored. After the fall of the Soviet Union, for more than 20 years Crimea attempted to exercise its right to self-determination. In January 1991, a referendum was conducted in Crimea, resulting in the adoption of a law in Ukraine regarding the establishment of autonomous Crimea. In September 1991, the High Council of Crimea adopted a declaration on State sovereignty. In 1992, the constitution of Crimea was adopted, declaring Crimea an independent state within Ukraine. However, in 1995, through a decision of the Ukrainian authorities and the President of Ukraine, the constitution was annulled, without the agreement of the Crimean people. We set out a number of other arguments in favour of the legality of the Crimean referendum at the Council meeting on 13 March (see S/PV.7134). In conclusion, we wish to confirm that we will respect the will of the Crimean people during the referendum of 16 March. Some colleagues today have achieved high levels of rhetoric. I must mention that the Ukrainian colleague nevertheless went far beyond anything permissible. If one is to speak of blood, indeed the blood is not on our hands but on the hands of his friends the nationalist radicals — the blood of those Ukrainians who were shot by snipers on days in February of this year — whose ideological fathers he defended not very long ago in the halls of the United Nations, stating that Nazi Ukranian henchmen did not kill anyone and that those were falsehoods made up by the Soviet Union. With regard to other statements, I must note that something has caught my attention. Colleagues that have taken the floor discussed poorly developed arguments, on the whole — it was not the argumentation put forward by my delegation, but distorted images or elements of our position. I will not comment on everything heard today — all of the highly unacceptable comments. I will, however, make a few comments. The French colleague did not notice the smallest hint of violence in Ukraine. It is possible that he was unaware of what occurred on Saturday in Kharkiv, where two citizens were killed by fighters from other regions of Ukraine. In fact, the violence had to be noted as it took place during this month in Kyiv and in other regions of the country. There is a continuing threat of violence and a continuing threat of it spreading to other regions of Ukraine. Yet the violence has not occurred in Crimea, due to measures taken there. The Permanent Representative of the United States blamed Russia for illegally pursuing its ambitions. That does not apply to us; it is a phrase taken from the foreign policy arsenal of the United States. Ms. Power spoke of truth. The world would be very interested to know if Washington, D.C., would in fact tell the truth about its role in the development of the crisis in Ukraine. Finally, Ms. Power spoke of dreams and aspirations. But why has she negated the right of the people of Crimea to express their will tomorrow during the referendum? To conclude, one of our colleagues said that Kyiv had extended a hand to Moscow and that we had refused to reciprocate. But the problem is not with Moscow; it has to do with the fact that Kyiv should have been the one to extend a hand to its people and regions, instead of intimidating them with repression and banning the use of the Russian language. Why, for instance, was the constitutional assembly not convened, and in reality, in the course of the constitutional process, it was not proved that the ideology and practice of radical nationalism did not prevail in Kyiv? It is unfortunate that much time has been lost. Nevertheless, we would appeal to all to put an end to the confrontation and to begin constructive cooperation with a view to a long-term settlement of the situation in Ukraine, in the interests of all of the people, including those in the eastern and south-eastern regions. ","The draft resolution (S/2014/189) was designed to prevent a further escalation of the crisis in Ukraine. It invited Council members to uphold the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of a United Nations State Member and to reaffirm core United Nations principles. It was about sending a clear signal that holding a referendum in Crimea would take us further away from a diplomatic solution. The resounding message from today’s vote is that Russia stands isolated in the Council and in the international community. Russia alone backs the referendum. Russia alone is prepared to violate international law, disregard the Charter of the United Nations and tear up its bilateral treaties. That message will be heard well beyond the walls of the Chamber. The position of the international community is clear. If the referendum is held tomorrow, it will have no validity, no credibility and no recognition. We trust that Russia will take notice of its isolation. On Thursday, we heard a clear message from the Prime Minister of Ukraine that Ukraine was willing to engage in dialogue with Russia to address its stated concerns (see S/PV.7134). The ball is now firmly in Russia’s court. If Russia fails to respond to Ukraine’s outstretched hand and instead continues with its military adventurism or seeks to take advantage of the illegal referendum, it will lead to further escalation of tension in the region and further consequences for Russia. We ask Russia to hear the collective voice of the international community today to rethink its actions and to take the decision to work with Ukraine and with the rest of the world to find a peaceful solution. ","The United States deeply appreciates the support from our colleagues around the table and from the many States that have called for a peaceful end to the crisis in Ukraine. This is, however, a sad and remarkable moment. It is the seventh time that the Security Council has convened to discuss the urgent crisis in Ukraine. The Council is meeting on Ukraine because it is the job of this body to stand up for peace and to defend those in danger. We have heard a lot, each time that the Security Council has met, about the echoes and relevance of history. We have heard, for example, about the pleas of the brave democrats of Hungary in 1956 and about the dark chill that dashed the dreams of Czechs in 1968. We still have the time and the collective power to ensure that the past does not become prologue. But history has lessons, for those of us who are willing to listen. Unfortunately, not everyone was willing to listen today. Under the Charter of the United Nations, the Russian Federation has the power to veto a Security Council draft resolution. But it does not have the power to veto the truth. As we know, the word “truth” — or “pravda” — has a prominent place in the story of modern Russia. From the days of Lenin and Trotsky until the fall of the Berlin Wall, Pravda was the name of the house newspaper of the Soviet communist regime. But throughout that period, one could search in vain to find “pravda” in pravda. Today one again searches in vain to find truth in the Russian position on Crimea, on Ukraine or on the proposed Security Council resolution (S/2014/189) considered and vetoed a few moments ago. The truth is that the draft resolution should not have been controversial. It was grounded in principles that provide the foundation for international stability and law, Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations, the prohibition of the use of force to acquire territory and respect for the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Member States. Those are principles that Russia agrees with and defends vigorously, all around the world; except, it seems, in circumstances that involve Russia. The draft resolution broke no new legal or normative ground. It simply called on all parties to do what they had previously pledged through internationally binding agreements to do. It recalled specifically the 1975 Helsinki Final Act and the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which Russia and other signatories reaffirmed their commitments themselves to respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity and to refrain from aggressive military action toward that country. The draft resolution called on the Government of Ukraine to do what it had promised it would do: to protect the rights of all Ukrainians, including those belonging to minority groups. Finally, the draft resolution noted that the planned Crimean referendum, scheduled for tomorrow, has no legal validity and will have no legal effect on the status of Crimea. From the beginning of the crisis, the Russian position has been at odds not only with the law, but also with the facts. Russia claimed that the rights of people inside Ukraine were under attack, but that claim had validity only in the parts of Ukraine where Russia and Russian military forces were exercising undue influence. Russia denied that it was intervening militarily, but Russian troops have helped to surround and occupy public buildings, shut down airports, obstruct transit points and prevent the entry into Ukraine of international observers and human rights monitors. Russian leadership has disclaimed any intention of trying to annex Crimea, then reversed itself and concocted a rationale for justifying just such an illegal act. Russia claims that its intentions are peaceful, but Russian officials have shown little interest in United Nations, European and American efforts at diplomacy, including Secretary of State Kerry’s efforts yesterday in London. Russia has refused Ukraine’s outstretched hand while, as we speak, Russian armed forces are massing across Ukraine’s eastern border. Two days ago, in this very Chamber, Ukraine’s Prime Minister appealed to Russia to embrace peace (see S/PV.7134). Instead, Russia has rejected a draft resolution that had peace at its heart and law flowing through its veins. The United States offered the draft resolution in a spirit of reconciliation, in the desire for peace, in keeping with the rule of law, in recognition of the facts and in fulfilment of the obligation of the Council to promote and preserve stability among nations. At the moment of decision, only one hand was raised to oppose those principles. Russia — isolated, alone and wrong — blocked the draft resolution’s adoption, just as it has blocked Ukrainian ships and international observers. Russia put itself outside the international norms that we have painstakingly developed to serve as the bedrock foundation for peaceful relations between States. The reason only one country voted against the draft resolution today is that the world believes that international borders are more than mere suggestions. The world believes that people within those internationally recognized borders have the right to chart their own future, free from intimidation. The world believes that the lawless pursuit of one’s ambitions serves none of us. Russia has used its veto as an accomplice to unlawful military incursion. That very veto was given nearly 70 years ago to countries that had led an epic fight against aggression. But in so doing, Russia cannot change the fact that moving forward in blatant defiance of the international rules of the road will have consequences, nor can it change Crimea’s status. Crimea is part of Ukraine today. It will be part of Ukraine tomorrow. It will be part of Ukraine next week. It will be part of Ukraine unless and until its status is changed in accordance with Ukrainian and international law. Russia prevented the adoption of a resolution today, but it cannot change the aspirations and destiny of the Ukrainian people, and it cannot deny the truth, displayed today, that there is overwhelming international opposition to its dangerous actions. ",,,,,,,,,,,"I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the members of the Security Council for their overwhelming support of the draft resolution contained in document S/2104/189, as well as for their support in trying to resolve the crisis by diplomatic and political means.
I would like to thank all the sponsors of the draft resolution for their support. In this difficult time for my country, we really need their support, and I want to assure them that it is highly appreciated by the people of Ukraine.
I would like to particularly thank the Member States who are the guarantors of the Budapest Memorandum who supported Ukraine — the United States, the United Kingdom, France and China — and who several times spoke in favour of territorial integrity. It is awful that the other one, the fifth guarantor, the Russian Federation, violated its own obligations.
All the appeals by the united membership to the wisdom of the Russian leadership were not successful. I received a call 40 minutes ago as we were discussing the crisis in Crimea, Ukraine. Members noticed that somebody called me. Russian troops entered the mainland from the south, from Crimea. Now we are facing a new development and we are to face an even more dangerous stance of the Russian Federation.
I appeal to all Council members to find the means and measures in the Security Council and the United Nations, as well as at the bilateral level, to do the utmost possible to stop the aggressor, the Russian delegation, present in the Chamber.
For us it is no surprise that Russia has vetoed today’s draft resolution. For that permanent member of the Council, it has become the custom to veto any measure aimed at maintaining international peace and security.
We remember the vetoes of draft resolutions on peacekeeping missions in Syria, which brought about thousands and thousands of deaths. I am confident that when Council members gather together next week with Ambassador Tanin to speak about the reform of the Security Council, the issue of the right of the veto will be discussed. Two cases, Syria and Crimea, will certainly be considered as examples of the behaviour of a permanent member of the Council when peace is needed.
(spoke in Russian)
The representative of the Russian Federation has stated many times in this Chamber that Russia’s right of the veto was gained through the blood of the Second World War. I would like to recall that it was the collective bloodshed of Ukrainians, Belarusians and Georgians. To manipulate the issue of the bloodshed is absolutely unacceptable. Moreover, it is a manipulation of the right of the veto before the new blood on one’s hands. Previously it was Georgian blood — now it is Ukrainian. I believe that such chaos should end now.
Today I take an optimistic view of the situation. Why so? Because I am convinced that the statement made by the Russian representative expressed not the voice of the Russian Federation, but rather the voice of the Soviet Union. The genuine voice of Russia today can be heard on the streets and squares of Moscow, St. Petersburg, Samara and Yekaterinburg, where thousands and thousands of people have gone to express their support and desire to protect Ukraine and its territorial integrity. That represents the democratic future of Russia and the basis on which we will build our fraternal ties.
Today the question of how to stop the aggressor concerns all of us. It involves the loss of the entire system of values established over the years through the untiring efforts of Member States towards a collective security system and non-proliferation.
(spoke in English)
I am confident that today the entire United Nations family demonstrated its unity. Tragic and dramatic events in Ukraine have united all of us. We must demonstrate that we are capable of protecting the United Nations system and the global security system through a new approach. I am absolutely confident that we will be able to do that. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My delegation is profoundly troubled by Russia’s veto of the draft resolution (S/2014/189) on the illegality of the referendum in Crimea, and we are worried about its consequences for the future of peace and security in the region and internationally.
On 31 May 1997 in a ceremony at the monument of the Liberator Soldier in Kiev, the late President of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, during his historic visit to Ukraine solemnly declared, “Ukraine is an independent country, and we will hold this promise sacred”. Russia “does not lay claim on any part of Ukraine or on any of its cities”.
And yet, in defiance to the Budapest Memorandum, whereby the Russian Federation reaffirmed its obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, contrary to the Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership between Ukraine and the Russian Federation of 1997, which affirms that both countries agree to respect each other’s territorial integrity and confirm the viability of the borders existing between them, and in violation of the obligations and commitments undertaken by Russia during its accession to key regional and international organizations, Ukraine is about to be carved up. While the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe and individual world leaders have been trying hard in the past few weeks to get Russia to engage with Ukrainian authorities in order to avoid a veritable crisis over Crimea, and while the Ukrainian authorities repeated their readiness to accept international monitors and mediation efforts, Russian troops and equipment were being amassed in Crimea, accompanied by aggressive anti-Ukrainian propaganda and hurried anti-constitutional acts by the Crimean Parliament to prepare the ground for an illegal referendum and eventual annexation of Crimea by Russia. Tomorrow a farce of a referendum will be held, in flagrant violation of the Ukraine and Crimean Constitutions and international law. The historical inhabitants of the peninsula, the Crimean Tartars, who see their future in and with Ukraine, said they would boycott this illegal happening. All others who care for the sovereignty and indivisibility of the country, including Crimea’s Ukrainians, will be left voiceless by this hastily concocted plebiscite, because the “yes” option to Crimea’s future in Ukraine is simply not on the ballot.
Our Russian colleague has spoken about self-determination and the independence of Crimea. Let me quote the self-proclaimed Prime Minister of Crimea, Aksyonov: “No, we will not have independence”, he said to the press,“Crimea should join Russia”, and it may happen in the next week or so. It is in that context that the Council has voted for a draft resolution condemning the illegal referendum in Crimea, saying yes to the non-use of force in relations between the States; yes to the sovereignty, territorial integrity, inviolability and political independence of Ukraine, and by way of extension, of any sovereign State. My country’s yes to the draft resolution is a yes to non-aggression, to a nation’s free choice of its destiny and its alliances, to democracy, to the rule of law and to the internationally accepted rules of behaviour based on the norms and principles of international law.
Today’s veto is not business as usual. By vetoing the draft resolution, built on the core tenants of the Charter of the United Nations, which clearly states that
“All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity of political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent for the Purposes of the United Nations” and that “The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements or other peaceful means of their own choice”.
The Russian Federation is challenging the very principles on which this Organization, the United Nations, is built and which supported the international system for the past seven decades. We deplore this veto. The world cannot allow a repetition of 1956, 1968 or 2008 in Europe. We call on all Member States and regional and international organizations not to recognize the results of the referendum in Crimea and not to recognize any alteration of the status of Crimea carried out in clear and obvious violation of the Constitution of Ukraine, a United Nations founding Member.
We call on Russia to disown the illegal referendum in Crimea. International observers, monitors and mediators have been invited by the Ukrainian Government and must be allowed to do their job. We also urge Russia to reaffirm its treaty obligations vis-à-vis Ukraine, including respect for its sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence, and to withdraw without delay its armed forces to the areas of their permanent stations. Only political dialogue and full respect of the Charter of the United Nations and international law can put an end to the crisis and prevent further bloodshed. ","Nigeria voted in favour of the draft resolution contained in document S/2014/189 because it reflects the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations, which obliges all States to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any Member State. The United Nations Charter also obliges States to settle their disputes by peaceful means. All throughout the crisis in Ukraine, Nigeria has consistently and unequivocally called on all concerned to abide by those principles in the interests of international peace and security.
The draft resolution, which is not a country-specific draft resolution but one that underscores universally agreed principles and the sanctity of international law, also mentions the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, which provides a framework within which the crisis could be peacefully resolved. We have consistently called for dialogue, mediation, restraint and an end to hostile rhetoric. Therefore, Nigeria is fundamentally opposed to the threat or use of force in settling international disputes. The lessons of history are not far-fetched, and we remain vigilant that the mistakes of history not be repeated by those alive today.
Nigeria has consistently advocated for mediation and the pacific settlement of disputes, including territorial disputes. Our willing submission to the rule of the International Court of Justice in our dispute with the Republic of Cameroon should serve as a beacon and an inspiration to law-abiding nations.
Nigeria is vehemently opposed to unilateral secession or forceful excision of territory designed to alter the configuration of States in their internationally recognized boundaries. Standing on that fundamental principle, Nigeria is opposed to any unilateral declaration by a component part of a State that will alter the configuration of the State to which it appropriately belongs.
It is therefore needless to restate that the impending referendum in Crimea is not in consonance with the Constitution of Ukraine. The consequences of any defiance are better imagined than described. ","Jordan has voted in favour of the draft resolution contained in document S/2014/189 out of its respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence and non-interference in its internal affairs. Moreover, it calls for adherence to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, especially Article 1, and to the use of peaceful means to settle disputes.
Jordan confirms the importance of upholding the territorial integrity of Ukraine and subjecting all its territories, including Crimea, to Ukrainian sovereignty, in accordance with the principles of international law and relevant international resolutions, including the 1994 Budapest Memorandum and the 1997 Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership. ","The delegation of Chile voted in favour of the draft resolution (S/2014/189) because we believe that it is the appropriate response of the Council to the current crisis in Ukraine. Given that situation, at stake here are fundamental principles of international law, such as abstaining from the threat or use of force and respecting the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.
For its part, the Budapest Memorandum requires that the signatory parties observe the independence, sovereignty and current borders of Ukraine and refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine.
The holding of a referendum on the status of Crimea is inconsistent with the Constitution of Ukraine, a unified State of which Crimea is an integral part. It is therefore fundamental that the rule of law be observed in Ukraine nationally and internationally.
It is for the people of Ukraine alone to determine their future in a democratic and inclusive process that guarantees the rule of law, human rights, fundamental freedoms and respect for the rights of minorities. The crisis must be resolved peacefully and through dialogue, in accordance with the norms of international law.
Chile regrets that the United Nations organ that has the primary responsibility for the maintainance of international peace and security has not been able to adopt a draft resolution. Today, owing to the use of the veto, the Council has not fulfilled its obligation. ","Since the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis, Chad has consistently expressed its commitment to the territorial integrity and unity of Ukraine, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. The intangibility of borders and territorial integrity of States is a sacred principle set forth in the Constitutive Act of the African Union. Chad’s vote in favour of the draft resolution contained in document S/2014/189 reflects that commitment.
Chad takes note with great concern the persistence of the escalation of the crisis in Ukraine, which is taking place despite the repeated appeals of the international community, and particularly the Security Council, for restraint and calm. We believe that it is still possible for the parties to open the way towards national reconciliation and maintaining Ukraine’s unity by engaging in inclusive dialogue among the various components with respect for diversity, human rights and in particular the rights of minorities.
Chad reiterates its call for respect for territorial integrity, the non-use of force and the peaceful settlement of disputes, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.
Also, we would like to once again call for calm and restraint. We believe that the solution to the crisis can only be a political and negotiated one. ","Australia is seriously disturbed that the draft resolution contained in document S/2014/189 before us was vetoed. Its purpose was to reaffirm the fundamental principles and norms governing relations between States in the post-1945 world — obligations that form the core of the Charter of the United Nations — respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States, the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, the illegality of the acquisition of territory through the threat or use of force and the obligation to settle disputes by peaceful means.
As the body mandated under the United Nations Charter with the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, the Security Council has a primordial responsibility to uphold those obligations. As Council members, we do so on behalf of all Member States. The draft resolution directly and carefully reflects those fundamental norms. There is nothing in it that any State Member of the United Nations could reasonably oppose. Russia’s decision to veto the resolution is therefore profoundly unsettling.
The referendum to be held tomorrow in Crimea is dangerous and destabilizing. It is unauthorized and invalid. The international community will not recognize the result nor any action taking on the basis of it.
With or without a resolution, the message from Council members and the wider international community has been overwhelming. The de-escalation of the current crisis is imperative. Russia must pull back its forces to their bases and decrease their numbers to agreed levels. It must allow international observers access to Crimea. It must demonstrate its respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including by desisting from any recognition of or action on the basis of the results of the Crimean referendum. It must engage in direct dialogue with Ukraine, as Ukraine has repeatedly requested, either bilaterally or through a diplomatic mechanism such as a contact group.
Russia can be under no misapprehension about the action the international community is demanding it take. Should it fail to respond, there will be consequences. The international community will demand it. ",,,,"Rwanda wishes to explain its vote on the text of the draft resolution (S/2014/189) before us. It is unfortunate that we have come to this today, as the situation could have been avoided. Voting for the text before us was a hard decision we had to make, and that is so because we are not convinced that the timing of the draft resolution was productive to the objective and purpose of the Security Council. It is hinged on the timing of the planned referendum in Crimea, which may not resolve the entire crisis. More cynical is the objective being stated in these corridors and in some capitals to isolate each other, including important stakeholders, in our search for a peaceful solution to the crisis in Ukraine. There is no need to isolate; however, there is a need for a real and frank dialogue. That is why we are in the Chamber, all of us, as a United Nations.
The situation in Ukraine has rapidly unfolded. We are concerned that the rhetoric of, and pressure from, many actors have blinded us from carefully analysing the situation and understanding the root causes, thereby preventing us from finding a suitable solution and, in the process, de-escalating the crisis. Why, then, did we vote in favour? The draft resolution contains important principles on which we all agree: respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries and the need for a de-escalation of the crisis. Most important to us is the fact that the draft text calls for a Ukrainian inclusive political dialogue.
We believe that the crisis in Ukraine can be settled primarily by a more vigorous campaign geared towards winning the hearts of all Ukrainians and ensuring the protection of all. To date, we have not seen such steps. There has not been intercommunal dialogue. It is time for Ukrainians to listen to their hearts. It is time to see statesmen on all sides helping their communities to identify that silver thread that has kept them together as a united and prosperous nation for all these years.
In that regard, we appeal to all conflicting blocs in Ukraine to pause a little, close their ears to all aggravating rhetoric and give intercommunal talks a chance. If there is a need for credible mediators, the United Nations should rise to playing that role.
Once again, we invite both sides to consider the mutual interests of the people of Ukraine and to uphold their commitment to bilateral and multilateral agreements. We call on the international community to fulfil its obligation, to ensure no further deterioration and to respect the principles of peace and security.
Finally, this situation is not a win or a loss to any of us. Also, it should not be seen as bringing dishonour to any of us. But let it be a lesson to us all to truly commit and constructively work towards finding a sustainable solution to the process. ","The delegation of Argentina believes that there is not much sense in making declarations about future events and hypothetical consequences. However, we voted for the draft resolution contained in document S/2014/189 because it reasserts the primacy of the principle of territorial integrity. We did so in the hope that the draft resolution could contribute to promoting constructive dialogue in Ukraine and a search for solutions through peaceful means and which includes all political and social actors who today disagree.
We trust that all the parties in Ukraine will refrain from unilateral action that could hamper dialogue or obviate opportunities for a peaceful and negotiated solution. We believe that it is for the Ukrainians to manage their internal affairs and to interpret those actions.
It is not for the Security Council to define this situation. Our responsibility is to maintain international peace and security. We therefore hope that all countries will respect the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and uphold their commitment to act strictly in compliance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations, with the goal of achieving a peaceful solution in the country. ","I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Luxembourg. Luxembourg deeply regrets that the draft resolution (S/2104/189). proposed by the United States of America, on the situation in Ukraine was not adopted because of the vote against it by Russia, a permanent member of the Council.
Luxembourg voted in favour of the draft resolution and is also a sponsor of the text, as did many United Nations States Members. Why? Because the draft resolution was based on principles and dialogue.
First, with regard to the principles, the draft resolution was intended to recall the purposes and principles of the United Nations, as set out in particular in Article 2 of the Charter. The draft resolution was intended to reaffirm the Security Council’s support for the sovereignty, independence, unity and the territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. The Security Council should be unanimous in upholding those principles. The Charter of the United Nations states that in discharging its duties the Security Council “shall act in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations”. Today, the Russian veto prevented the Security Council from complying with that provision.
With regard to dialogue, in accordance with Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations, the draft resolution under consideration by the Council this morning was intended to urge all parties to seek a peaceful settlement immediately through direct political dialogue, to exercise restraint, to refrain from any unilateral action and any inflammatory rhetoric that might increase tension and to engage fully in international mediation efforts. However, the referendum organized for tomorrow in Crimea is intended to change the status of the Ukrainian territory against the will of Ukraine. If the referendum were to take place, it would constitute a unilateral act that could very seriously destabilize Ukraine and the entire the region.
Pursuant to the Charter of the United Nations, Member States have conferred upon the Security Council the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. Today, the Russian veto prevented the Security Council from assuming that responsibility in the interest of peace and security in Ukraine and Europe.
The referendum organized for tomorrow in Crimea runs contrary to Ukraine’s Constitution, which stipulates that the territory of Ukraine is indivisible and inviolable. The referendum is also contrary to the Constitution of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The international community can in no way recognize its outcome.
The referendum of 16 March is part of a vicious cycle. The decision taken on 1 March by the Council of the Russian Federation to authorize the use of the Russian armed forces on Ukrainian territory, and the subsequent actions undertaken, constitute a flagrant violation of international law. Those actions violate the commitments Russia entered into with regard to Ukraine within the framework of the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 and the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership Agreement between Russia and Ukraine, signed in 1997. Had it been adopted, the draft resolution would have helped to put an end to that vicious cycle and the nationalist escalation that accompanies it.
Today’s vote is a failure — a failure for the Security Council and the United Nations, but also, and above all, a failure for Russia.
Would it be naive to hope that, despite that failure, we can still find a peaceful solution to the crisis that Russia is imposing on Ukraine and the international community? For its part, Luxembourg will not abandon that hope. Even if diplomatic efforts have not yet borne fruit, they must continue to achieve a solution that respects the political independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in the interest of peace, stability and prosperity in Europe.
I resume my functions as President of the Council.
I give the floor to the representative of Ukraine. ","The Republic of Korea voted in favour of the draft resolution contained in document S/2014/189, as we firmly believe that the unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine should be fully respected and that the future of Ukraine should be decided by the Ukrainians themselves without any intervention or influence by outside forces. We think that the draft resolution clearly embodies those principles.
It is regrettable that the draft resolution was not adopted by the Security Council today. Still, we very much hope that today’s failure will not close the window on a peaceful and diplomatic solution to the crisis. "
